    "## Week - 8 - Deep Neural Nets and Text\n",
    "\n",
    "In this week we introduce the use of Deep Neural Networks to work with text. We have already seen some uses of neural networks for text in our classification HW, where we used a simple neural network--the one-layer perceptron--to classify text. It performed quite well, but comes up short in more sophisticated classification tasks, such as in predicting intent. We have also seen slightly deeper, 2-level neural nets in the form of word embeddings such as Word2Vec. While they work well, they have some drawbacks, such as representing words with multiple meanings in a singular space. \n",
    "\n",
    "BERT, which is a language model built using bidirectional encoders, allows us to take advantage of a powerful pre-trained model which we can then use to perform our own tasks based on data we analyze. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we use ```huggingface/transformers```, a python package that allows for easy interface to use pre-trained BERT models. It is built using Tensorflow and PyTorch, two computational graph packages which are built specifically for creating powerful neural networks. We will also be introducing Keras, which allows us to easily build Neural Networks in an abstracted way. Keras is a popular way to understand how we can stack layers to create such Neural Networks, but to reach state-of-the-art results we will stick with using BERT and similar models that can be tuned to extremely high performance on specific language understanding and generation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this, we begin by using the [Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability](https://nyu-mll.github.io/CoLA/). We will also use BERT by learning how to extract embeddings from such a model and use it to semantically probe sentences. There are a number of new packages and methods we will be using so be sure to update lucem_illud_2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "## NOTE\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook **requires** GPUs for training models in section 1 and section 3. To train models, please use this [Google Colab file](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_G6iGqiXb-zPBTurRxd7cgGrXyNaKGsA) to create the models. Note that I have only given you view access: please create your own colab file to train your models, using the code and instructions I have given in the Colab file. So while you have to do the homework on this notebook, the models which you will train should be done on Google Colab, which has GPU access. If you happen to have GPU access on your personal machines or some other way to train the models, you are welcome to do that too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you run the computationally intensive models on your local computer they will take a long time!"

    "### Introducing Deep Neural Nets\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular, simplified package for introducing deep neural networks is [Keras](https://keras.io). It is a high level package in that we don't bother with every detail or hyper-parameter associated with the neural network (e.g., regularizers), and can stack on layers directly. For a rapid tutorial on neural networks for text such as the LSTM or the Recurrent Neural Network, Colah's blog is a great start. [LSTM](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) is an article on LSTMs, and if you'd like to  learn about RNN, Andrej Karpathy does a great job in [this blog post](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/), in addition to our reading from the newest online verion of Jurafsky & Martin's review of deep learning methods in their book on speech and language processing, chapters [6,7,9,10](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/), and the [*Deep Learning*](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) book by Goodfellow, Bengio & Courville.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following cells we build a basic deep net that has an embedding layer and an LSTM to perform classification. This is to illustrate the process of using Keras, which is a very popular library for such work. It may not yield state of the art performance because it constrains the hyperparameters you can tune, but is nonetheless an useful tool and works well on some datasets."

    "## Loading our Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Train Model\n",
    "Now that our input data is properly formatted, it's time to fine tune the BERT model.\n",
    "For this task, we first want to modify the pre-trained BERT model to give outputs for classification, and then we want to continue training the model on our dataset until the entire model, end-to-end, is well-suited for our task. Thankfully, the huggingface pytorch implementation includes a set of interfaces designed for a variety of NLP tasks. Though these interfaces are all built on top of a trained BERT model, each has different top layers and output types designed to accomodate their specific NLP task.\n",
    "We'll load BertForSequenceClassification. This is the normal BERT model with an added single linear layer on top for classification that we will use as a sentence classifier. As we feed input data, the entire pre-trained BERT model and the additional untrained classification layer is trained on our specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of Fine-Tuning Model\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've showed beforehand, the first token of every sequence is the special classification token ([CLS]). Unlike the hidden state vector corresponding to a normal word token, the hidden state corresponding to this special token is designated by the authors of BERT as an aggregate representation of the whole sentence used for classification tasks. As such, when we feed in an input sentence to our model during training, the output is the length 768 hidden state vector corresponding to this token. The additional layer that we've added on top consists of untrained linear neurons of size [hidden_state, number_of_labels], so [768,2], meaning that the output of BERT plus our classification layer is a vector of two numbers representing the \"score\" for \"grammatical/non-grammatical\" that are then fed into cross-entropy loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Fine-Tuning Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the pre-trained BERT layers already encode a lot of information about the language, training the classifier is relatively inexpensive. Rather than training every layer in a large model from scratch, it's as if we have already trained the bottom layers 95% of where they need to be, and only really need to train the top layer, with a bit of tweaking going on in the lower levels to accomodate our task.\n",
    "Sometimes practicioners will opt to \"freeze\" certain layers when fine-tuning, or to apply different learning rates, apply diminishing learning rates, etc. all in an effort to preserve the good quality weights in the network and speed up training (often considerably). In fact, recent research on BERT specifically has demonstrated that freezing the majority of the weights results in only minimal accuracy declines, but there are exceptions and broader rules of transfer learning that should also be considered. For example, if your task and fine-tuning dataset is very different from the dataset used to train the transfer learning model, freezing the weights may not be a good idea. OK, let's load BERT!

    "### Similarity metrics\n",
    "It is worth noting that word-level similarity comparisons are not appropriate with BERT embeddings because these embeddings are contextually dependent, meaning that the word vector changes depending on the sentence it appears in. This enables direct sensitivity to polysemy so that, e.g., your representation encodes river “bank” and not a financial institution “bank”. Nevertheless, it makes direct word-to-word similarity comparisons less valuable. For sentence embeddings, however, similarity comparison is still valid such that one can query, for example, a single sentence against a dataset of other sentences in order to find the most similar. Depending on the similarity metric used, the resulting similarity values will be less informative than the relative ranking of similarity outputs as some similarity metrics make assumptions about the vector space (equally-weighted dimensions, for example) that do not hold for our 768-dimensional vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Without fine-tuning, BERT features may be less useful than plain GloVe or word2vec.\n",
    "They start to be interesting when you fine-tune a classifier on top of BERT. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Transformers Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "The context vectors make the other pipeline functions which transformers has built in a lot more powerful. \n",
    "\n",
    "### NOTE\n",
    "The pipeline functionality in transformers is currently being worked on and might be broken, so it is an optional part of the exercise. Do try to uncomment the lines of code and try to see if it works, though! If you have managed to get transformers v2.5.1 installed, it will work - I managed to get it to work sometimes, it can be annoying to get it to work but when it works it works well.\n",
