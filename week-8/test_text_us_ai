"<p> The future looks bright , except when it does n't . Here are 10 exceptionally regrettable developments we can expect in the coming decades . <p> Listed in no particular order . <h> 1 . Virtually anyone will be able to create their own pandemic <p> Earlier this year , Oxford 's Global Priorities Project compiled a list of catastrophes that could kill off 10 percent or more of the human population . High on the list was a deliberately engineered pandemic , and the authors warned that it could happen in as few as five years . <p> The fear is that a rogue state , terrorist group , or a malign individual might create their own virus and unleash it . Natural selection is good at creating nasty and highly prolific viruses , but imagine what intentional design could concoct . <p> Sponsored <h> 2 . People who transfer their minds to computers are actually killing themselves <p> This is what 's known as the "" continuity of consciousness "" problem . Sure , we may eventually be able to cut , copy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a digital substrate , but transferring the seat of consciousness itself may be an untenable proposition . Neuroscientists know that memories are parked in the brain as physical constructs ; there 's something physically there to copy . But consciousness still eludes our understanding , and we 're not certain how it arises in the brain , let alone how we can transfer it from point A to point B. It 's also quite possible that subjective awareness can not be replicated in the digital realm , and that it 's dependent on the presence and orientation of specific physical structures . <p> Many futurists predict that one day we 'll upload our minds into computers , where we 'll ... Read more Read more <p> Mind uploading will likely require destructive atomic-scale scanning of the brain . It would be similar to the way teleportation is done in Star Trek . Indeed , one of the dirty little secrets of this sci-fi show is that the person being teleported is actually killed each time it happens , replaced by an exact duplicate who 's none the wiser . Mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed , replaced by a digital being who 's convinced they 're still the original -- but it would be a delusion . <p> Advertisement <h> 3 . Authoritarianism will make a comeback <p> As threats to national security increase , and as these threats expand in severity , governments will find it necessary to enact draconian measures . Over time , many of the freedoms and civil liberties we currently take for granted , such as the freedom of assembly , the right to privacy ( more on this next -- it 's worse than you think ) , or the right to travel both within and beyond the borders of our home country , could be drastically diminished . <p> Hitler certainly knew how to capitalize on fear . <p> At the same time , a fearful population will be more tempted and willing to elect a hardline government that promises to throw the hammer down on perceived threats -- even overtly undemocratic regimes . <p> The threats to national security will have to be severe to instigate these changes , but history has precedents . Following the September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US government enacted the Homeland Security Act . This legislation was criticized for being too severe and reactionary , but it 's a perfect example of what happens when a nation feels under threat . Now imagine what would happen if another 9/11-type event happened , but one involving hundreds of thousands of deaths , or even millions . <p> Such an act of terrorism could be unleashed through miniaturized nuclear weapons , or the deliberate release of bioweapons . And the fact that small groups , and even single individuals , will have the power to attain and use these weapons will only make governments and citizens more willing to accept the loss of freedoms . <h> 4 . Privacy will become a thing of the past <p> We are rapidly approaching the era of ubiquitous surveillance , a time when virtually every aspect of our lives will be monitored . Privacy as we know it will cease to exist , supplanted by Big Brother 's eyes and ears . <p> Big Brother watches William Hurt in 1984 . <p> Governments , ever fearful of internal and external threats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Corporations , eager to track the tendencies and behaviors of its users , will find it impossible to resist . Citizens of the surveillance society will have no choice but to accept that every last detail of their lives will be recorded . <p> Looking ahead , government agencies and police could deploy more sophisticated tracking devices , including the much-anticipated smart dust -- tiny sensors that would monitor practically anything , from light and temperature to chemicals and vibrations . These particles could be sprinkled around Earth , functioning as the eyes and ears of the planet . In conjunction with powerful data mining algorithms , virtually everything we do would be monitored . To ensure accountability , we could watch the watchers -- but will they allow it ? <h> 5 . Robots will find it easy to manipulate us <p> Long before artificial intelligences become truly conscious or self-aware , they 'll be programmed by humans and corporations to seem that way .

Recent approaches propose inferring predictors from a variety of human-defined features using machine learning . Here we determine the long-time evolution of a glassy system solely from the initial particle positions and without any handcrafted features , using graph neural networks as a powerful model . We show that this method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods , generalizing over a wide range of temperatures , pressures and densities . In shear experiments , it predicts the locations of rearranging particles . The structural predictors learned by our network exhibit a correlation length that increases with larger timescales to reach the size of our system . Beyond glasses , our method could apply to many other physical systems that map to a graph of local interaction . <h> Main <p> Certain liquids undergo arrested dynamics when cooled sufficiently quickly . Over a small range of temperatures , the relaxation time of the liquid increases by orders of magnitude until it falls out of equilibrium and into a disordered solid-like state1,2,3 . This glass transition is a ubiquitous phenomenon , occurring in granular materials , colloidal suspensions and biological cells , and is observable experimentally and numerically . Understanding the causes of this slowdown is a major open research question4 . Unlike in standard phase transitions , the dramatic change in dynamics is not obviously correlated with static properties of the system : the system behaves like a solid but still appears like a liquid , and there is no clear correlation length that diverges near the transition . In this context , studies in the past decade have focused both on understanding the nature of the dynamical relaxation of glasses5,6 and , later , on determining structural markers of the transition7,8,9 . As stated in a recent review4 "" the main difficulty when searching for static correlations is that one does not know what one is looking for "" -- which indicates that machine learning may be well-suited for automatically discovering structural predictors10 . <p> First applications of machine learning to glassy systems dynamics discovered that machine-learned softness could predict dynamical properties11,12 , inspiring a family of work extending softness to various systems , including polycrystals and low-dimensional films13,14,15 . These works rely on support vector machines ( SVMs ) 16 and use physical intuition to precompute heuristic features for each particle . Although these efforts have shown that softness can predict whether particles will rearrange in the near future , they were unable to yield much insight into long-time dynamics . <p> While the SVM approach treats each input independently , a different family of machine learning models , graph neural networks ( GNN ) 17,18,19 , use the graph structure of their input . These models learn embeddings for the nodes and edges of their input graphs , updating these embeddings via learned message-passing rules . As such , they do not require human-defined features and can leverage the power of deep networks for feature discovery . Moreover , they are inherently relational and can learn features that pertain to the relationship between entities20 . They have been successfully applied to forward dynamics prediction since the original work on interaction networks18 , but only on systems where the equations of motion are directly integrable21,22,23 . In our case , the timescales involved are of such length that the network must make predictions after particles have collided thousands of times . Thus , the network must learn a coarse-grained version of the dynamics . Recently , graph networks were also applied to constraint satisfaction on graphs24,25,26,27 , a class of problems that share local interactions and frustration with glasses and , potentially , more phenomenology28 . Here we take inspiration from these approaches and show that they are extensible to continuous degrees of freedom in finite dimension , and can predict finite-temperature evolution rather than minimal energy . We show that graph networks are a powerful tool for extracting predictive information solely from the static structure of a glassy system . <h> Training procedure <p> We simulate the dynamics of a binary 80:20 Kob -- Andersen-type Lennard -- Jones mixture of N ? = ? 4,096 particles in a three-dimensional box with periodic boundary conditions29 . We follow the procedure described in the Methods to generate equilibrated particle configurations at 13 state points covering more than three decades of relaxation time . Figure 1 shows the corresponding ensemble mean displacement ( Delta r(t)=frac1NrmAlanglesum j = 1NrmAparallel **27;1459;TOOLONG ... 2rangle ) and real part of the self-intermediate scattering function ( S ( mathbfq , t ) =frac1NrmA ... j = 1NrmAcos left ( mathbfq ( mathbfrj(t)-math ... where denotes the thermodynamic average , t denotes the time , j iterates over the NA ? = ? 3,277 particles of type A and ( mathbfq ) corresponds to the first diffraction peak in the static structure factor . Throughout the text , we use dimensionless units based on the Lennard -- Jones potential . <p> Fig. 1 : Simulations . <p> a -- d , Ensemble mean displacement ( a ) and real part of the intermediate scattering function ( b ) as a function of time ( t ) , measured relaxation time ( tau rmg=S-1 ( mathbfq , frac1 ... ( c ) and probability distribution of displacements ( PDF ) ? ri(tg) ( d ) for 13 state points along a linear path in temperature ( T ) , pressure ( p ) and density ( N/L3 ) between T ? = ? 0.56 , p ? = ? 0.17 and T ? = ? 0.44 , p ? = ? 2.93 ( training conditions are indicated with an asterisk ) . The solid line in c is a fit using the Vogel -- Fulcher -- Tammann equation47 ( tau rmg approx rmefracaT-Trmo ) with a ? = ? 0.62 ? ? 0.02 and T0 ? = ? 0.387 ? ? ? 0.001 . <p> We train our architecture on four distinct state points that cover a wide range of temperatures , pressures , densities and relaxation times , as shown in Fig. 1 . For each of these points , we generate 400 independent configurations to serve as training examples for our networks ( we checked that our results would not improve with more training examples , see Extended Data Fig. 1 ) . Those examples are augmented by randomly applying one of their 24 cubic symmetries . We then evaluate them on an independent test set of another 400 independent configurations . From each of these configurations , we run 30 separate simulations with different initial velocities , sampled from the Maxwell -- Boltzmann distribution . We compute the propensity30,31 of each particle i , ? ri(t) , the mean displacement under those random velocities , and train our network to predict this propensity for particles of type A. It is known that the propensity , more than single-sample trajectories , is a good candidate in the search for a connection between local structure and dynamics on longer timescales30 . Our main metric is the Pearson correlation coefficient ? between the predicted and true propensity of the A particles , which allows easy comparison of the prediction quality of various models at different timescales and state points . We also provide alternative metrics and more fine-grained details on a case-by-case basis and in the Supplementary Information . <p> For each training example , we input the coordinates and types of all N particles to our graph network . The graph is structured according to interparticle distance : particles at a distance of less than 2 are connected by an edge ( Fig. 2a ) . Particle types are the features on the nodes of the graph , while the three-dimensional relative positions are the features on the edges of the graph . We then apply an interaction network18,19 to this input graph to predict the expected propensity for each particle of type A. This network first encodes the nodes and edges of the input graph independently with two two-layer multilayer perceptrons ( MLPs , ENC in Fig. 2c ) , one for every node and another one for every edge . It then performs message passing on this graph , recursively updating graph edges and nodes ( G in Fig. 2c ) . Edge updates are based on the features of the given edge and of its associated nodes , concatenated and passed through an MLP ( Fig. 2b , left ) . All edges are updated in parallel using the same MLP ( edge MLP ) . Node updates are based on the features of the node and on the sum of its associated updated edge features , concatenated and passed through another MLP ( Fig. 2b , right ) . Again , all nodes are updated in parallel using the same , different MLP ( node MLP ) . We note that these update rules make it possible for the network to run on a graph of an arbitrary size . To stabilize training , both the node and edge MLPs also receive features from the initial encoded graph as input . After repeating these updates nrec times ( in this study , we use nrec ? = ? 7 ) using the same G , information from each particle has effectively propagated up to the size of the periodic box 's side length . The network decodes the resulting node embeddings as the predicted propensity ( Fig. 2 ) , which is regressed towards the target propensity ? ri(t) via stochastic gradient descent over the network 's parameters . <p> Fig. 2 : Model architecture . <p> a , From the three-dimensional inputs , nodes at a distance of less than 2 are connected by two directed edges to form a graph . After processing , the network predicts propensities for each particle of type A. b , The graph network 's core first updates edges based on themselves and adjacent nodes , and then nodes based on themselves and incoming edges . c , The graph network consists of an encoder ( ENC ) , nrec applications of the core ( G ) , followed by a decoder ( DEC ) . Each application of the core increases the shell of particles contributing to a given particle 's prediction , here shown in colour for the central particle ( dark blue ) . d , A two-dimensional illustration48 of node activities from the encoder up to the final update . The colour codes the target propensities of the corresponding particles , with separate colour scales for particles of type A ( colour bar on right ) and type B ( greyscale on left ) . The code starts at two possible locations , corresponding to the two possible node inputs . This separation , related to the underlying particle types , remains present throughout the network . Early on in the computation , nodes referring to particles with similar propensity yield similar codes , both for particles of type A ( colour ) the network is trained on , as well as particles of type B ( grey ) . The final layer yields linearly separable embeddings . <h> Predicting propensity at various timescales <p> We first examine how well the graph network predicts the propensity of particles from the initial configuration over a large range of timescales . We focus on the state point with the lowest temperature we studied at T ? = ? 0.44 , close to the mode-coupling theory temperature TMCT ? = ? 0.435 of the system29 . The corresponding relaxation time in the glassy phase tg , ( S ( mathbfq , tau rmg ) =1/rme ) is tg ? = ? 4,636 ( we provide the distribution of the propensity at this temperature in Extended Data Fig. 7 ) . We note that this prediction time is 463 times larger than the one previously studied with machine learning techniques12 . We compare our network with two machine learning baselines : a linear SVM that takes as input 440 handcrafted features per particle and constitutes the state-of-the-art method12 , and a convolutional network that takes as input the same particle features and aggregates them onto a grid that is later processed by a convolutional stack . As a simple physically motivated baseline , we use the potential energy of each particle to predict the particle propensity30,32 . A stronger baseline is given by the local Debye -- Waller factors , which use the short-time dynamics , that is , ground-truth information up to ( t=S-1 ( mathbfq , frac34 ) ) to predict the long-time propensity33,34 . Finally , we also predict the particle propensity by calculating the mode participation fraction of each particle for the soft modes of the initial particle configurations , that is , the eigenvectors associated with the smallest eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix of the system35 . <p> With only input types and relative positions , and without any handcrafted features , the graph network outperforms all the other methods at all temperatures and across all timescales ( from the end of the ballistic regime all the way to the diffusive regime ) ( Fig. 3 ) . We note that at very short timescales , between the end of the ballistic regime and the onset of the glassy plateau , our method achieves the best possible performance , indicating that the graph network can fully compute early caging behaviour . In contrast , past the end of the glassy plateau , the performance of a three-dimensional convolutional network approaches that of the graph network , in agreement with a picture where the diffusive dynamics on those timescales incorporate more elements from the density field and depend less on shorter length scales . These interpretations are in agreement with an analysis of the features used by the network , which we present in our ' Analysis of the networks prediction ' section . Between these two extreme regimes lie the timescale where ( S ( mathbfq , t ) simeq 0.7 ) , corresponding to the appearance of irreversible motion . This prediction appears to be the most difficult for the graph network while being the best timescale for the physics-inspired soft modes baseline ( note that the latter does not capture the thermal oscillation within a cage on very short timescales ) . <p> Fig. 3 : Thermal experiments results . <p> a , b , Pearson correlation coefficient of propensity predictions for a fixed state point with T ? = ? 0.44 ( a ) and various state points at a fixed timescale t ? = ? tg ( b ; vertical grey dashed line in a ) . Each point and its error bars shows the median , best and worst of ten independently trained models . The shaded region indicates the upper bound on the correlation values , related to the finite number of trajectories used to construct each test label ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ) . Our method ( GNN ) is superior to other machine learning ( convolutional network ( CNN ) , SVM ) and physics ( soft modes ( SM ) , Debye -- Waller ( DW ) , potential energy ( PE ) ) methods , as described in the main text . c , Four-point correlation function ? 4(t) as a function of time ( from left to right T ? = ? 0.50 , T ? = ? 0.47 , T ? = ? 0.44 ) for the simulation , GNN and SVM . Larger values indicate larger spatial correlations in the dynamics . d , GNN generalization to state points not seen during training ( t ? = ? tg ) . The four states used for training are indicated by coloured diamonds on the curve . Error bars are as in a. e , Linear interpolation of the propensity predicted by the GNN and the 10% most mobile particles ( black ) in a two-dimensional slice through the simulation box . <p> We also note that the performance of the graph network increases for lower temperatures , possibly exploiting the reduced thermal noise in the ground-truth labels ( Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 3 ) . Beyond obtaining a better overall correlation , the graph network also outperforms all of the other methods when classifying particles with extreme propensities , the spatial correlation of propensity and the location of the soft spots where the most mobile particles reside ( Fig. 3e , Extended Data Figs. 4 -- 6 and Supplementary Information for details ) . <p> The performance of the graph network monotonically increases when augmenting the number of edges in the graph , and also when increasing the number of recurrent steps ( Extended Data Fig. 2 ) . This indicates the network 's capacity to compute and propagate correlations in the local inputs , discussed further below . This capacity is also apparent when measuring the four-point susceptibility ? 4(t) of the propensity . The latter , defined as30,36 <p> measures the structural contribution to the dynamic fluctuations of the system ( we use a ? = ? 0.438 , the median displacement of the system for T ? = ? 0.44 and t ? = ? tg ) . When varying t , while both the SVM and the graph network produce a curve with the right shape , the graph network produces notably larger values for ? 4 ( Fig. 3c ) . <h> Temperature generalization <p> To probe the generalization capabilities of our network , we focus on the characteristic time tg defined above . For each of the four state points ( indicated by asterisks in Fig. 1 ) , we train a graph network to predict the propensity at tg . We investigate the performance of these networks on 13 uniformly spaced state points between the two extreme temperatures in our study ( T ? = ? 0.56 and T ? = ? 0.44 ) . We emphasize that neither the temperature nor any other thermodynamic quantity is provided to the network , and while the network does not directly predict the value of tg for the various state points , it can readily be obtained via standard analysis ( Fig. 1c ) . <p> We find strong generalization in the glassy regime : models trained at a state point within the glassy phase ( below T ? = ? 0.50 ) maintain their prediction quality at other state points within the glassy phase . In particular , the performance of a graph network trained at T ? = ? 0.47 steadily increases as the test temperature is lowered ( Fig. 3d ) , and its performance at T ? = ? 0.44 is almost the same as the one of a network directly trained at this temperature . <p> Above the glassy phase ( T ? = ? 0.50 ) , the prediction quality of models trained at low temperature deteriorates quickly . This is only the case , however , for the median of the ten identically trained models . As is typical for neural networks , individual models exhibit very different behaviours : some generalize at least partly to high temperatures , while others perform consistently below a random baseline . A closer investigation reveals that models generalize better when they are robust to changes in the number of graph edges caused by the changing density . Correspondingly , linearly re-scaling the number of connections as a function of temperature can substantially improve the generalization performance ( Supplementary Fig. 26 ) . <h> Predicting propensity under shear stress <p> Understanding and predicting the mechanical properties of materials such as glasses is another grand challenge of practical importance37 . Defects and soft spots are known to be connected to plastic rearrangement locations9,38 , and previous machine learning approaches ( SVMs ) have shown capacity to infer such predictors , again using handcrafted features39 . Here we demonstrate graph networks ' ability to internalize and predict propensity during shear stress to uncover future soft spots . <p> With the same equilibrated configurations used to predict propensity , we perform athermal quasi-static ( AQS ) 40 simulations ( described in detail in the Methods ) to explore how the configurations rearrange when the periodic box is subject to a shear stress along one of its axes . At a given tilt , we train models to predict the displacement of each particle with respect to its neighbouring particles11 as the tilt is increased by 4% . <p> Figure 4a shows that the graph network again outperforms both the SVM and the physics-inspired baselines based on the potential energy of each particle and the soft modes of the system41 ( except for tilts near the thermally equilibrated system , in the linear relaxation regime , where the soft modes baseline -- also a linear approach -- performs as well as the graph network ) . The quality of the graph network 's prediction increases up to tilts of about 20% , corresponding to the end of the linear response regime in the total potential energy U. Figure 4b visualizes the spatial correlation of the predicted propensity with the actually most mobile particles . This quantity is particularly relevant as such soft areas should correspond to fragile regions of the material under shear stress . Introducing a more quantitative measure for this , we also find that the graph network performs the best for this metric ( Supplementary Information ) . Finally , although graph networks do predict where a rearrangement will occur , we did not manage to train them to learn when they happen ( that is , the location of the drops in the potential energy curve , Fig. 4a ) . We hypothesize that this is due to the stochastic nature of the rearrangements . We also found that training directly from the equilibrated configuration towards a large tilt angle ( rather than the incremental prediction done here ) led to worse predictions , potentially because of particles rearranging multiple times for larger angles . <p> Fig. 4 : Shear-stress experiment results . <p> Pearson correlation coefficient of propensity predictions for various box tilts in an AQS system a , The grey curve is the potential energy of a single realization of the system ( right axis ) . Each point and its error bars shows the median , best and worst of ten independently trained models . b , Linear interpolation of the propensity predicted by the GNN and the 10% most mobile particles ( black ) in a two-dimensional slice through the simulation box . <h> Analysis of the network 's prediction <p> So far , we have shown the prediction of dynamics from static structure . This provides a black box that is useful for predicting interesting physical quantities , but is still of limited use -- how does the network uncover information from static structure ? Here we explore the solutions found by machine learning in detail . <p> Using a series of ablation experiments , we dissociate which input features are crucial for the correct prediction . In Fig. 5a , we report the performance of graph networks trained with inputs containing different combinations of the full feature set . The most striking outcome is that in the glassy regime , distance alone is sufficient to obtain the maximum correlation . Knowing the three-dimensional angle of the neighbouring particles improves the performance only for the shortest time predictions -- where the graph network also reaches a perfect correlation . Even with no information provided on the nodes or edges ( ' none ' ) , the model yields non-trivial predictions , which improve for longer-time dynamics , to eventually exceed the SVM baseline . This graph network derives a coarse description of local density purely from its connectivity ( see Supplementary Information for more details ) and can be further optimized by choosing a finer edge threshold ( 1.2 instead of 2.0 , ' none opt ' in Fig. 5a ) . <p> Fig. 5 : Analysis of the graph network at T ? = ? 0.44 . <p> a , Ablating input features . Test performance of models trained on different combinations of input features . We report the median metric of ten independently trained models , and indicate the best ( worst ) model using uncertainty bars , as in Fig. 3a . For ( S ( mathbfq , t ) le 0.7 ) , which includes the glassy and diffusive regimes , distance information ( light blue curve ) is enough for optimal prediction . Only the shortest-time predictions ( ( S ( mathbfq , t ) &gt;0.7 ) ) benefit from the additional angle information . The model still performs well above average without any node or edge features ( ' none ' ) , and performance further improves when using a smaller distance threshold to construct the input graph ( 1.2 instead of 2.0 , ' none opt ' ) . Performance of the SVM trained on the full data is shown for comparison . b , Performance of linear regression based on the number of neighbours of each type within a certain distance ( x axis ) , confidence interval : 10th to 90th percentiles . Colours refer to ballistic , glassy and diffusive regimes ( see legend for c ) . Overlaid , performance after just two recurrent steps of the default network ( dashed lines ) and the ' none ' network ( dotted lines ) trained with different edge thresholds ( x axis ) . Note that it was impractical to run networks with edge threshold 3 ( the graph became too dense ) . Vertical lines depict average distance to nearest neighbours ( shell 1 ) and the further 6 shells . c , Evaluating trained networks ( nrec ? = ? 7 ) on inputs modified according to the graph neighbourhood of a given particle . Error bars are as in a . We multiply all connections ( relative positions ) between a pair of shells ( x axis ) by 1 ? + ? ? ( with ? ? = ? 10-3 ) , and compare the output to the unperturbed network ( y axis , left , absolute change averaged over all particles normalized to the median prediction for the given ( S ( mathbfq , t ) ) and scaled by ? ) . The number of affected edges is shown in grey ( y axis , right ) . <p> We thus test the predictive power of the local density by regressing the propensity against the number of particles contained within a certain distance ( Fig. 5b , solid lines , and Extended Data Fig. 10 ) . We find that the linear predictions for glassy and diffusive regimes are indeed reliable , with correlation comparable to that of the physics models for large timescales ( Fig. 3a ) . Moreover , changing the size of the neighbourhood ( x axis in Fig. 5b ) affects the quality of the linear predictions in a similar way to that of changing the edge threshold in the ' none ' networks ( dotted lines ) , with positions of peaks and troughs perfectly aligning for these two prediction methods ( the first peak , around 1.2 , corresponds to the edge threshold of the ' none opt ' network ) . The performance of our default network with distance information ( Fig. 5b , dashed lines ) is much less sensitive to the exact choice of edge threshold , as this network does not need to rely on the graph topology to infer relative particle distances . Note , that in Fig. 5b , we show the performance of graph networks at just one extra computation step ( nrec ? = ? 2 ) . For nrec ? = ? 1 , the ' none ' network 's performance is close to the linear prediction . Extra computation steps of our network improve the prediction ( Extended Data Fig. 2 , top ) , but do not change the wavy reliance on the distance parameter , which , as we show in Supplementary Figs. 29 and 30 , is attributed to the density of particles of type A around the probed particle . <p> To attempt to approximate the correlation length of our network , we investigate particles ' contribution to predictions as a function of their distance from a target particle . For a given particle , the unrolling of the network defines nrec shells of particles around it that contribute to its propensity prediction ( Fig. 2c ) . We perform a series of experiments where we either slightly perturb the connections between the shells ( Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 9 ) , or simply remove all information about particles outside of the first n ? &lt; ? nrec shells ( Extended Data Fig. 8 ) . We see that for the shortest-time predictions ( ( S ( mathbfq , t ) =0.9 ) , green ) , most of the network 's output is based on each particle 's closest neighbours , for every temperature tested . In contrast , in the glassy regime ( t ? = ? tg , orange ) , the prediction for a central particle remains sensitive to particles located farther away ( note that the lower values between two and three shells correspond to a change of sign of the perturbation effect on the output ( see Supplementary Fig. 24 for details ) . As the system approaches the lowest temperatures , this correlation length has reached nearly half the size of our box . Other studies have also identified a growing correlation length from dynamical quantities above the mode-coupling temperature30,42 . It was not a priori obvious that the graph network would extract such a growing length from supervised training ; this is a good indication of the expressiveness of this method . We also note that while our length scale is inherently dynamical , our network computes it without needing to perturb the system ( as in point-to-set defined lengths43 ) or to run the full dynamics forward . Moreover , as it corresponds a higher correlation and is particular to the desired timescale , this length could be a better indicator than that obtained from , for example , the soft modes of the system37 or simpler machine learning approaches12,44 . <h> Conclusion <p> Our results show that graph networks constitute a powerful tool to predict the long-term dynamics of glassy systems , leveraging some of the structure hidden in the local neighbourhood of particles . We hope that this technique will lead to more insights for glassy-system theorists , for instance , around the characteristic length scales that emerge from our network or the gap between the reached accuracy and the theoretical upper bound in the glassy phase . We also expect that graph networks could demonstrate a similar predictive power for other physical quantities of interest in glassy systems . Another interesting avenue in this direction would be to generalize our study to polydisperse systems that were recently equilibrated at low temperatures45 , to obtain results below the mode-coupling temperature . <p> More generally , graph networks are a versatile tool that do not require any prior on the relevant physical quantities of the underlying system . They could be applied to the widespread scientific problem of improving and accelerating simulations of many-body systems in interaction , in contexts as varied as n-body simulations , traffic , crowd simulations or cosmology46 . <h> Methods <h> Simulation details <p> We perform molecular dynamics simulations using the LAMMPS49 molecular dynamics package . We simulate a system of N ? = ? 4,096 particles in a cube of side length L with periodic boundary conditions at various temperatures and pressures . We study the particle interactions of a binary mixture of large particles A and small particles B that interact via a 6 -- 12 Lennard -- Jones potential <p> where a , ? ? ? A , B. The interaction coefficients are set for a typical Kob -- Andersen configuration50 where ? AA ? = ? 1.0 , ? AB ? = ? 1.5 , ? BB ? = ? 0.5 , sAA ? = ? 1.0 , sAB ? = ? 0.8 and sBB ? = ? 0.88 . For computational efficiency , we ignore long-distance interactions where r ? &gt; ? 2.5sAA . On the basis of the Lennard -- Jones potential , we define dimensionless units and measure distances in units of sAA , time in units of ( tau =sqrtfracmsigma rmAA2epsilon rmAA ) ( with m the atomic mass ) , temperature in units of ( fracepsilon rmAAkrmB ) ( with kB the Boltzmann constant ) and pressure in units of ( fracepsilon rmAAsigma rmAA3 ) . To obtain an equilibrated system at the desired temperature and pressure , we perform several stages of simulations to safely reach a desired state point . First , we equilibrate the system at a starting high-temperature state point ( TS ? = ? 0.5495 , PS ? = ? 0.4888 ) using an isothermal-isobaric ensemble . We then perform a gradual quench to the desired state point ( TT , PT ) using the same method , followed by one final run at the target state point to help preserve the pressure and temperature . We then switch to a canonical ensemble to further stabilize the temperature and pressure and obtain an equilibrated system . We run each part of this equilibration process for at least ten relaxation times . <h> Thermal simulations <p> To probe the glassy regime , we run a constant microcanonical ensemble and sample the system at logarithmically increasing time points29 . For each of the temperatures indicated by an asterisk in Fig. 1 , we create a training set and a test set of 400 examples each , corresponding to 400 equilibrated configurations . For each of these configurations , we then run 30 simulations with initial velocities drawn independently at random from a Maxwell -- Boltzmann distribution31 . In addition , we generate 50 independent config"
"<p> MANILA -- All Jefferson Soriano wanted was to go to bed . But the power was out , his tiny room felt like a furnace , and his friend Manuel Borbe had come by . The pair walked outside to chat and get some air , eventually stopping for a late-night coffee along a busy road . <p> Soriano and Borbe had lived nearly their entire lives in the area , a shantytown in a Manila community called Holy Spirit , and had met as teens on a neighborhood basketball court . They had been friends ever since , growing up together , and now both were new fathers in their 30s struggling to make ends meet -- Soriano by working odd jobs in grocery stores and fast-food restaurants , Borbe as a construction worker . <p> At the time , Rodrigo Duterte 's first year as president of the Philippines was coming to a close , a violent period during which the government prosecuted a war on drugs , in which police swept down , arrested suspected drug sellers , and conducted sting operations against them . Officers were given wide latitude to shoot , andkill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy Spirit was one of the offensive 's epicenters . <p> Soriano and Borbe had themselves been caught up in police raids : The former had been reported for his contact with drug dealers , the latter had previously surrendered to police and admitted that he was a user of crystal meth , or shabu . In fact , just a month before , policemen had barged into Soriano 's home while he was in the bathroom naked and dragged him outside as he begged for his life . They took him to the police station and , he says , beat him as they questioned him about his association with drug dealers . <p> So that night -- June 15 , 2017 -- Borbe was anxious , worried for his wife and infant son were he to be arrested , or worse , killed . "" My time , "" he told Soriano as they sipped coffee , "" will soon be up . "" <p> While they sat and chatted , a car drove past , its headlights casting a glow on a tall , well-built man standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was soon joined by another man , who arrived on a motorcycle . Each was clad in the same attire -- a dark jacket , shorts , and a balaclava . <p> "" Bro , cops , "" Soriano told Borbe , believing that the men , despite their face coverings , were police officers . Their stocky build , their posture -- hands on their sides , as though they were about to draw their guns -- reminded him of the many policemen he 'd had run-ins with over the years . Before either friend could do anything , one of the men raised his arm and fired a pistol . Borbe slumped to the ground , taking a fatal shot to the head . Soriano tried to run , but other shooters were waiting at nearby street corners , and fired at him from different directions , hitting him in the neck and leg . As he lay bleeding on the pavement , pretending to be dead , Soriano recalls , he heard the gunmen mount their motorcycles to flee , only for one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to push it downhill to get away . <p> "" The only thought I had in my mind then , "" he said in an interview this year in Manila , where he is in hiding , fearing for his life , "" was that I had to live for the sake of my son . "" <p> Yet this well-publicized killing is not included in any official count of drug casualties . It has not been fully investigated . It is unclear who the shooters were . As we have found , that is far from unusual : Borbe is only one among a huge number of uncounted victims of Duterte 's drug war . <p> Elected in 2016 pledging to crack down on drug use , Duterte has now passed the halfway point of his six-year presidency . In that time , the president has employed populist tactics such as naming and shaming 150 judges , mayors , and police generals he says coddled drug dealers and releasing a list of 46 government officials running for office he claims were involved in illegal narcotics . Local officials across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitor their progress kicking the habit , while police stations must maintain watch lists of alleged drug suspects who are under surveillance . Duterte has assured the police that he has their backs , telling them , "" You are free to kill the idiots "" who violently resist arrest . <p> By some measures , that is having a positive impact : The overall national crime rate went down 20 percent in the past two years ( though murder rates have gone up ) . And politically , this muscular approach to the drug problem has been a windfall for Duterte . His approval rating is close to 80 percent , and in midterm elections to the Senate in May , candidates who backed his drug war fared well , topping the polls even in the shantytowns where suspects were being gunned down . <p> Duterte delivers a speech in March 2017 , warning major media outlets of repercussions for critical coverage of his drug war . ( Noel Celis / AFP / Getty ) <p> But at what cost ? The police say they have killed some 5,500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past three years , and that unknown gunmen have killed more than 3,000 other drug suspects , amounting to a tenth of the nearly 30,000 homicides carried out in the Philippines since Duterte 's drug war began . ( The police blame the drug-linked killings on narcotics syndicates ; human-rights groups say these executions are often the work of off-duty cops or hired guns on the police payroll . ) <p> An investigation carried out by the Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism shows , however , that these figures are a gross underestimation of the extent of drug-related killings in the Philippines . The data we have collected -- based on documents and reporting on homicides , as well as multiple visits to neighborhoods where the killings took place -- illustrate how large numbers of killings of drug suspects , by both police and unidentified shooters , have been excluded from official counts : In three municipal areas of Metro Manila , the sprawling Philippine capital of 13 million people , our data show that half of all homicides recorded by the police were tied to illicit narcotics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related to drugs . In addition , we found hundreds of homicides that were not on the police record at all . <p> This discrepancy goes beyond a question of correctly labeling or reporting incidents of violence , and instead points to concerns about how this war on drugs is being carried out . Is what is taking place in the Philippines an anti-crime campaign , or something darker , in which large numbers of people are being denied due process , targeted for assassination , and offered little in the way of help to quit drug use , while the underlying issues driving the problem are left unaddressed ? Filipinos themselves said soon after Duterte took office that , while they applauded the push against narcotics , it was important that suspects be arrested , not killed . <p> "" In none of the wakes I 've been to has someone said , ' Kap , why did they have to kill him ? ' "" <p> This has implications beyond the Philippines , too . Responding to concerns about the "" staggering number "" of drug-related deaths in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last month to investigate the killings , and the International Criminal Court is looking into charges that Duterte and other officials have committed crimes against humanity . Other countries , including Indonesia , Bangladesh and Sri Lanka , are looking to the Philippines as a model for fighting drugs , but would they be so positive about Duterte 's strategy if they knew the true body count ? <p> The Philippine leader has dismissed any concerns about whether his plan is the right one , arguing that drug users eventually graduate to more violent crime , and so cracking down on them saves lives overall . "" Your concern is human rights , "" he railed in a fiery speech last year . "" Mine is human lives . "" <p> According to the Manila police 's own guidelines , homicide victims who are reported to be involved with drugs or who are found with drugs or drug paraphernalia in their possession , and when no other motives could explain their death , should be classified as drug-related fatalities . Based on those standards , the police say that from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just begun and was at its most intense , 965 people were killed by gunmen or police officers in the three Metro Manila "" cities "" we focused on : Manila , Quezon , and Caloocan , which cumulatively account for roughly half of the capital 's population . <p> Our reporting shows , however , that the real death toll is actually far higher . We cross-referenced the police 's own data against news stories , police blotters as well as spot and incident reports , and memos on police shootings submitted to the internal-affairs department at the national police headquarters . We compiled lists of casualties with the help of church groups , human-rights organizations , academic researchers and journalists , as well as the Commission on Human Rights , a national watchdog . And we reviewed a database of drug-war casualties that researchers at the Ateneo School of Government constructed using news reports . <p> In all , we built a list of fatalities based on 23 different sources and visited four communities in the capital to verify the information . To be included on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alleged drug use , been a drug user or seller , been listed on a drug watch list , or been accused in a drug-related case . In the majority of cases , this information was found in news reports , police records , and survivor testimonies . In some cases , killings were executed in the trademark style of drug-linked homicides -- armed assassins wearing balaclavas on motorcycles or other vehicles -- but there was no information on the victim 's drug links . We included 80 of these that were recorded in police documents , because they took place in neighborhoods where many similar killings had occurred . <p> One reason for the gulf is that some killings are clearly improperly categorized . Borbe 's death , for example , was not listed as drug-linked but as a "" homicide under investigation , "" a label under which many cases languish for years . Fewer than 80 drug-related killings have been prosecuted by the country 's Department of Justice since Duterte took office . Countless others , including Borbe 's , remain unsolved . Guillermo Eleazar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that proper categorization was not important . "" We respect the judgment of the investigator assigned to the case , "" he said . "" For our purposes , it does n't matter whether a case is drug-related or not . "" Then he added : "" We all know that drugs are the root of all crime . "" <p> The police have also , notably , offered an inconsistent account of how many drug users have died at the hands of their own officers . In June , they said that 1,180 people had been killed across Metro Manila in the preceding three years , yet in mid-2017 , the country 's then -- police chief published a glossy report saying that more than 1,200 "" drug personalities "" had been killed in the capital in the previous year alone . When we asked about this difference , the police said that they could not ascertain the source of the police chief 's report and that "" local police stations regularly update their records , "" causing changes in the data . Each time we asked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous ones . And in interviews we conducted in the past two years , police commanders cited much higher casualty counts than what the current numbers show . <p> In fact , if anything , our casualty count may even be an underestimate . Many killings are not recorded by the police or by journalists , and the churches and human-rights workers that document the dead have limited reach . <p> Patrick Ball , a statistician with the Human Rights Data Analysis Group in San Francisco , used machine learning to analyze the various lists we obtained in building our own tally , relying on a technique called "" multiple-systems estimation "" to count undocumented conflict-related deaths , essentially comparing information from multiple data sets and inferring what was not recorded . He has previously estimated casualty counts in conflicts in Syria and Guatemala , predicted the locations of graves of missing victims of Mexico 's drug war , calculated the death rate of political prisoners in Chad , and served as an expert witness in international tribunals . ( In one notable case , his testimony helped convict Guatemala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genocide . ) <p> Based on Ball 's calculations , using our data , nearly 3,000 people could have been killed in the three areas we analyzed in the first 18 months of the drug war . That is more than three times the official police count . <p> ( Jonathan Soma and Marie Patino ) <p> Methamphetamine began trickling into the Philippines in the late 1980s . It was initially smuggled in from China , but then later began being manufactured locally and was sold to all manner of people -- seasonal construction workers , taxi drivers , grocery baggers , waiters and busboys on short-term contracts , and call-center workers who labored around the clock , using shabu to stay alert . Shabu is the poor man 's drug -- the rich , according to Duterte , prefer cocaine or heroin , both of which he considers safer and "" not as destructive "" as crystal meth . <p> But unlike in Central America , where drugs are sold by armed gangs , most shabu peddlers here are ordinary men and women for whom selling tiny sachets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hawking cigarettes or newspapers to help pay for food or school fees . Police and officials long ignored the trade , or at times evenprofited off it , protecting smuggled shipments of drugs as they were trafficked through the country 's porous ports . <p> It was this web that Duterte 's drug war sought to hit , and among the neighborhoods that were targeted was Holy Spirit , a network of densely packed alleys with one of the highest concentrations of drug-linked killings in Manila . <p> Holy Spirit , named after the order of nuns who set up a school for girls in a gated community in the 1970s , lies just a couple of miles away from the Philippines ' House of Representatives building and is a sprawling area that , in effect , houses two communities , each living parallel yet separate lives . The neighborhood 's gated villages have wide , tree-lined streets and are replete with their own churches , parks , and shopping areas , while residents have access to clubhouses and swimming pools . A short walk away , however , lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built along unpaved alleys . The streets are crowded , doubling as basketball courts , markets , and karaoke parlors . <p> At the start of the drug war , in mid-2016 , Eleazar , the current Metro Manila police chief , was put at the helm of security in Quezon City , the municipality where Holy Spirit is located , replacing an officer accused of protecting drug dealers . He reshuffled five of 12 station commanders and exiled one to the southern island of Mindanao , then removed policemen who had allegedly been extorting money from drug suspects and brought in new officers willing to take the lead in the drug war . <p> Police forensic teams inspect evidence after an operation in which three suspect drug dealers were killed in Manila in June 2016 . ( Dondi Tawatao / Getty ) <p> The changes were welcomed in Holy Spirit . "" That was the first time I saw the police were actually doing their jobs , "" says Felicito Valmocina , the tall , lanky longtime kapitan of the Holy Spirit local council . The year before Duterte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police blotter in the neighborhood -- mostly thefts and robberies , but also 19 homicides . Valmocina claims that the shabu trade thrived in his community because cops were themselves the drug 's suppliers and the police looked the other way as shabu was traded in the open . <p> The drug war changed that . Police began making the rounds , focusing on the poor parts of Holy Spirit , areas where many , such as Soriano , still lived with their parents . Residents were encouraged to rat on their drug-using and drug-dealing neighbors by submitting anonymous reports in boxes . Based on these reports and on information gathered by neighborhood watchmen in the local council 's employ , Holy Spirit officials put 187 people on a watch list , knocking on their doors to warn them of the impending crackdown . Still , Valmocina says , many persisted in using shabu , and so while he wishes they were not killed , either by police or masked gunmen , the drug trade was so widespread that something needed to be done . The shift in policing tactics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duterte 's new strategy , some 20 fewer crimes were recorded in Holy Spirit -- but of the overall total , 58 were homicides , a threefold increase . <p> In Valmocina 's telling , many Holy Spirit residents accepted that trade-off . At the wakes of people who were killed , he would ask those in attendance how they were coping . "" They 'd say , ' Ay kapitan , we 're grateful we have one less . That guy was a big headache , ' "" Valmocina recalls . "" In none of the wakes I 've been to has someone said , ' Kap , why did they have to kill him ? ' "" <p> "" No one has complained to me , "" he continues . "" They say , ' This is good .

He remains popular , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Yet there is nevertheless significant disquiet among survivors of shootings , rights groups , and parts of the religious community . There are questions of legality ( do the police have the right to embark on such an expansive drug war , seemingly curbing due process en route ? ) ; morality ( is there not an obligation to try to help people kick their habit , rather than killing them outright ? ) ; and fairness ( the majority of the victims are poor , young men -- Noel Abecendario , a retired army sergeant who is now the head of public safety in the Holy Spirit district , acknowledges that richer suspects are pursued "" up to the village gates , but the homeowners wo n't let us in .

But if this debate seems inconclusive , that is in good part because it is based on a misunderstanding of populism . Populists can come in all kinds of ideological flavors . Many , especially in Europe , are far-right . Some , especially in Latin America , are far-left . A few , like those who belong to Italy 's Five Star Movement , claim to eschew traditional political categories . What they all have in common is an opposition to the pluralism that is inherent to any functioning representative democracy : By claiming that they , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the world delegitimize any institution that might provide a check on their power . This is why populists so often turn against long-standing democratic traditions . <p> The newest member of the anti-Trump crowd is promising to mobilize against the president : "" I may have sucked as a communications director , but I 'm a pretty organized entrepreneur . "" <p> When I last visited Anthony Scaramucci , in the middle of his investment company 's annual conference in Las Vegas , he made it known that if President Donald Trump wanted him , he 'd be game for a sequel . <p> That was back in May . Much has happened since in the life of the erstwhile White House adviser , who in the summer of 2017 spent 11 memorable days as Trump 's communications director before he was fired over a profane phone interview . <p> Scaramucci is poised for a second act , just not the one he envisioned . He 's been feuding with Trump ever since he appeared on the August 9 episode of Real Time With Bill Maher , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done has been "" absolutely indefensible . "" Trump tweeted that he was watching the broadcast , albeit "" by accident . "" ( That 's by no means uncommon : Maybe the remote gets stuck on the wrong channel . Maybe you press the buttons , but nothing happens , and before you know it , you 've spent an hour of your presidency watching premium cable . An accident . ) <p> Campus tour guides are expected to serve as the face of the university and as an authentic voice for prospective students . Can they truly be both ? <p> The clouds are playing matador defense on the sun when I get to the Washington , D.C. , campus of Georgetown University in mid-July . They stunt at shading my already sweaty neck before retreating and allowing the sun to beat down once again . Walking into the Edward B. Bunn , S. J. Intercultural Center is a respite . There , seated and smiling behind a white pop-up table , I meet Jaydon Skinner -- one of the university 's famous Blue and Gray tour guides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of prospective students and their parents around campus . The group will bend around historic buildings , as Jaydon tells stories about the time he encountered former President Bill Clinton -- "" My tours have the presidential seal of approval , "" he 'll say -- and the school 's 2017 hire of a Hall of Fame NBA star and Georgetown alum , Patrick Ewing , as head basketball coach . But first , the nearly 200 people signed up for the tour will be crammed into a small , wood-paneled auditorium for an information session with Bruce Chamberlin , a senior admissions director at the university . <p> Mary Ward , a naturalist and astronomer , decided to go for a ride in her cousin 's homemade automobile . <p> In August 1869 , Mary Ward took a badly needed holiday at her cousin 's castle in the Irish midlands west of Dublin . Ward was an active naturalist and astronomer , working hard to carve out a place for herself in the overwhelmingly male world of Victorian science . She was also raising eight children more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone at the castle suggested taking her cousin 's homemade automobile out for a spin , Ward went along . <p> In the 1860s , automobiles were basically big toys , and when the party set out that day around the town green , death was likely the furthest thing from their minds . But cars were dangerous toys back then , as well , and the group 's little lark -- on August 31 , 1869 , exactly 150 years ago this weekend -- ended with Ward being crushed under the car 's wheels . This accident made the 42-year-old scientist the first automobile fatality in history , cutting short what might have been , if not for a demanding home life and one errant turn , an even more remarkable career . <p> Millennials are already in debt and without savings . After the next downturn , they 'll be in even bigger trouble . <p> The trade war is dragging on . The yield curve is inverting . Investors are fleeing to safety . Global growth is slowing . The stock market is dipping . The Millennials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A sputtering economy means miserable financial , emotional , and physical-health consequences for everyone from infants to retirees . But the next one -- if it happens , when it starts happening -- stands to hit this much-maligned generation particularly hard . For adults between the ages of 22 and 38 , after all , the last recession never really ended . <p> Millennials got bodied in the downturn , have struggled in the recovery , and are now left more vulnerable than other , older age cohorts . As they pitch toward middle age , they are failing to make it to the middle class , and are likely to be the first generation in modern economic history to end up worse off than their parents .

It Should Embrace It <p> Jesus Rodriguez is the CEO of IntoTheBlock , a market intelligence platform for crypto assets . He has held leadership roles at major technology companies and hedge funds . He is an active investor , speaker , author and guest lecturer at Columbia University . <p> During the last few days , there has been an explosion of commentary in the crypto community about OpenAI 's new GPT-3 language generator model . Some of the comments express useful curiosity about GPT-3 , while others are a bit to the extreme , asserting that the crypto community should be terrified about it . <p> I think it is unlikely that GPT-3 by itself can have a major impact in the crypto ecosystem . However , the techniques behind GPT-3 represent the biggest advancement in deep learning in the last few years and , consequently , can become incredibly relevant to the analysis of crypto-assets . In this article , I would like to take a few minutes to dive into some of the concepts behind GPT-3 and contextualize it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GPT-3 is a massively large natural language understanding ( NLU ) model that uses an astonishing 175 billion parameters to master several language tasks . The size makes GPT-3 the largest NLU model in the world , surpassing Microsoft 's Turing-NLG and its predecessor GPT-2 . <p> GPT-3 is able to perform several language tasks such as machine translation , question answering , language analysis and , of course , text generation . GPT-3 has captured the attention of the media for its ability to generate fake text that is indistinguishable from real . <p> How is this relevant for crypto ? Imagine having the ability to regularly generate fake press releases that move the price of the smaller crypto assets ? Sounds like a scary threat , but it is not the most important part of GPT-3 . <p> GPT-3 is a language-based model and , consequently , operates using textual datasets . From the crypto market standpoint , that capability is cool but certainly not that interesting . What we should really be paying attention to are the techniques behind GPT3 . <h> The magic behind GPT-3 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as transformers . The concept of transformers was originally outlined in the paper "" Attention is all you need , "" published in 2017 by members of the Google Brain team . <p> The main innovation of the transformer architecture is the concept of "" attention "" ( hence the title of the paper ) . Attention is typically used in a type of problem known as Seq2Seq , in which a model processes a sequence of items ( words , letters , numbers ) and outputs a different sequence . This type of problem is incredibly common in language intelligence scenarios such as text generation , machine translation , question answering and so on . <p> Every time you see a Seq2Seq scenario , you should associate it with what 's called encoder-decoder architectures . Encoders capture the context of the input sequence and pass it to the decoder , which produces the output sequence . Attention mechanisms address the limitations of traditional neural network architectures by identifying the key aspects of the input that should be "" paid attention to . "" <p> Think about a machine translation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will translate the Spanish text input into an intermediate representation known as the "" imaginary language "" that will be used by the decoder to translate it into English . More traditional deep learning architectures need constant feedback between encoders and decoders , which makes them highly inefficient . <p> Conceptually , attention-mechanisms look at an input sequence and decide at each step what other parts of the sequence are important . For instance , in a machine translation scenario , the attention mechanism would highlight words the decoder "" should pay attention to "" to perform the translation . <p> The transformer architecture that powered models like GPT-3 is a traditional encoder-decoder architecture that inserts attention blocks to improve efficiency . The role of that block is to look at the entire input and current outputs and infer dependencies that will help to optimize the production of the final output . <p> The transformer architecture has produced models that can be trained in massively large datasets and can be parallelized efficiently . Not surprisingly , after the original Google paper , there has been a race to build super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BERT , Facebook 's RoBERTa , Microsoft 's Turing-NLG and OpenAI GPT-3 are newer examples of these models . <p> GPT-2 astonished the world by operating using 1.5 billion parameters . That record was smashed by Microsoft 's Turing-NLG , which used 17 billion parameters , only for GPT-3 to use a ridiculous 175 billion parameters . All that happened in a year . Plain and simple : when it comes to transformers , bigger is better . <p> The first generation of transformer architectures has focused on language tasks . But , companies like Facebook and OpenAI have published recent research adapting transformer models to image classification . You might think that this is just an attempt to generate fake images . But the impact goes way beyond that . <h> Transformers and crypto-assets <p> Now that we have some context related to transformers and GPT-3 , we can revisit the original question . Is GPT-3 really scary for crypto-assets ? <p> Sure , the prospect of models that can generate fake news that move crypto markets is nothing to joke about . But I think that , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the crypto space . What is more interesting is the impact that transformer architectures can have in the next generation of crypto intelligence solutions . Here are a few real scenarios to consider : <p> Trading strategies . Obviously , if transformers are proven to be applicable to financial datasets , they can have a major impact in quant strategies for crypto assets . Deep neural networks in general are opening new frontiers in quantitative trading . From basic machine learning models like linear regression or decision trees , quant funds are now looking at sophisticated deep learning strategies . <p> Being natively digital , crypto is the perfect asset class for quant strategies . Techniques such as recurrent neural networks ( RNNs ) and convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ) have gained popularity in the quant space and seem to work well in crypto . Just like in language analysis , transformers could have an edge over CNNs and RNNs , specifically when comes to focus "" attention "" in several segments of a dataset ( for example , during the March 2020 Bitcoin crash ) and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transactions ) . <p> More interesting is the impact that transformer architectures can have in the next generation of crypto intelligence solutions . <p> Blockchain analysis . Transformers can be adapted to detect patterns in blockchains in more computationally efficient ways than current methods . Part of the magic of transformers is their ability to "" focus attention "" on specific parts of an input dataset and infer potential outputs . Imagine a scenario in which we are analyzing bitcoin mining transactions or flows to exchanges and try to extrapolate patterns in order book activity . Transformers seem particularly well equipped to attack this task . <p> Decentralized transformers . There are ongoing efforts to adapt transformer models to decentralized AI architectures like SingularityNet . This type of use case could expand the use of transformers to scenarios we have n't imagined yet . Until now , transformer models such as GPT-3 has been the privilege of large corporate AI labs that have the data and resources to build and operate such massive neural networks . Decentralized AI offers an alternative , in which the training , execution and monitoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on incentive mechanisms . <p> Just like other neural network architectures have been able to operate in decentralized infrastructures , it is not crazy to think that soon we will see models like GPT-3 running in decentralized AI platforms like SingularityNet or the Ocean Protocol . <p> GPT-3 and the transformer architecture represent a major breakthrough in the history of deep learning . In the next few years , we are likely to see transformers influence every major area of deep learning , and the influence is likely to expand into financial markets . Crypto should be a beneficiary of these breakthroughs . <p> Yes , GPT-3 is impressive , but there is no reason to be terrified . Quite the opposite , we should do the work to adapt these major AI achievements and make crypto the most intelligent asset class in history ."
"<h> An exec who oversees music for 850+ radio stations tells us what the ' song of the summer ' will be , and why <p> For over 20 years , Tom Poleman has tried each year to figure out what the song of the summer will be . <p> Poleman is the head of programming for iHeartMedia , the radio giant that operates more than 850 stations , including New York 's Z100 , where Poleman has had a hand in the day-to-day music decisions since 1996 . <p> Poleman began his foray into radio in the ' 80s , when he worked for his college radio station at Cornell . And he says one of his favorite things has been trying to identify what that timeless hit of the year was going to be . <h> What makes a song of the summer ? <p> "" Being upbeat and fun is part of it , "" Poleman says . "" It does resonate ... Tempo songs tend to do great . Reggae tends to cut through in the summertime . "" He points to last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But it does n't have to be infused with reggae . <p> "" Any song that is particularly infectious and connects with somebody emotionally "" has a shot , he says . Justin Timberlake 's "" Ca n't Stop the Feeling "" is n't a reggae song , he continues , but it sticks with you . "" If you asked me a to pick a summer song right now , I 'd absolutely pick JT 's ' Ca n't Stop the Feeling ' , "" Poleman says . <h> Summer radio <p> On-demand streaming services like Spotify have transformed the music industry in recent years , sending shockwaves through the market for digital downloads . And these companies , along with the internet radio pioneer Pandora , have invested in the ability to provide personalized , radiolike experiences that could be seen as a threat to traditional radio . <p> RCA <p> Spotify , in particular , scored a runaway hit with its "" Discover Weekly , "" a playlist that uses artificial intelligence to pick new songs you 'll like every week . Many people ( including me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can succeed . <p> "" Radio is social , first and foremost , "" Poleman says . <p> People have time they want to feel connected to the world , to what 's hot , Poleman explains . They also have times when they want their exact tastes to be served up to them . Poleman thinks there 's room for both pop radio and the ultra-personalized . ( And iHeartMedia has a foot in both camps with its iHeartRadio streaming service , though it is known more for radio . ) <p> And radio shines in the summer , he says . <p> "" People are outside , out of the home , heading down to the Jersey Shore , "" he says . You want to be able to sing out the lyrics to the latest pop hit on the dance floor . <h> Choosing the summer songs <p> "" There 's a lot more science behind programming for the radio than people think , "" Poleman says . "" You would be amazed at the spreadsheets that we look at every music meeting . "" <p> Poleman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- from digital sales to "" thumbs ups "" in streaming apps to a tactic called "" hit predictor . "" <p> "" Hit predictor "" is when Poleman 's team gets a sample of listeners and has them listen to a new song over and over again , at least 20 times in its entirety , and then asks them about it -- "" could you see this being a hit ? "" One example of a song that crushed it in "" hit predictor "" was Charlie Puth and Selena Gomez 's "" We Do n't Talk Anymore . "" <p> "" It had one of the highest scores I 've ever seen , "" Poleman says . <p> But it 's not going to be the song of the summer . ( It was released in January . ) <p> Here are the ones Poleman says have a shot , from lowest to highest likelihood :"

"<p> You also agree that your personal information may be transferred and processed in the United States , and that you have read and agree to the Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy . <p> field that has progressed in fits and starts since the 1950s . Today 's cheap storage and amped-up and inexpensive compute power , combined with an explosion in data , have revived an interest in deep learning and "" neural nets , "" which use multiple layers of data processing that proponents sometimes liken to how the brain takes in information . <p> The field is red hot today , with Google , Facebook and other technology giants racing to apply the technology to consumer products . In the second part of this story , SearchCIO senior news writer Nicole Laskowski reports on where two AI luminaries -- Facebook 's Yann LeCun and Microsoft 's Eric Horvitz -- see the trend going . <p> Like Microsoft , IBM and Google , Facebook Inc. is placing serious bets on deep learning , neural networks and natural language processing . The social media maven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning by hiring Yann LeCun , a well-regarded authority on deep learning and neural nets , to head up its new artificial intelligence ( AI ) lab . A tangible byproduct of this renewed focus on neural nets is Facebook 's digital personal assistant , M , which rolled out to select users a few months back . <p> Today , M 's AI technology is backed by human assistants , who oversee how M is responding to queries ( such as placing a take-out order or making a reservation ) and can step in when needed . According to a Wired article , the AI-plus-human system is helping Facebook build a model : When human assistants intervene to perform a task , their process is recorded , creating valuable data for the AI system . <p> Once enough of the "" right data "" is collected , M will be built on neural nets , which is where LeCun 's team comes in . But even as the AI behind M advances to neural nets , humans will need to be in the loop to continue training the technology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done <p> That 's because M , like most contemporary AI systems , is a supervised learning system , which means the system ca n't teach itself . Instead , if LeCun wants an algorithm to recognize dogs , he has to feed it examples of what dogs look like -- and not just a handful of examples . "" You have to do it a million times , "" LeCun said at EmTech , an emerging technology conference hosted by the MIT Technology Review . "" But , of course , humans do n't learn that way . We learn by observing the world . We figure out that the world is three-dimensional , that objects move independently . ... We 'd like machines to be able to do this , but we do n't have good techniques for this . "" <p> Yann LeCun <p> Building machines that have a kind of artificial common sense , according to LeCun , will be the big challenge for the future of AI . "" It 's done by solving a problem we do n't really have good solutions for yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the ways Facebook ( among others ) is trying to insert rudimentary reasoning into AI systems is with vector embedding , where unstructured data is mapped to a sequence of numbers that describe the text or object in detail . LeCun said the process brings together perception , reason , perspective and language capabilities so that if the algorithm encounters an unfamiliar word or image , it can make an educated guess by comparing and contrasting the rich mathematical descriptions of the unknown against the known . One of his clearest explanations about how vector embedding works had to do with language translation : "" We can take two pieces of text , one in French and one in English , and figure out if they mean the same thing , "" he said . <p> Facebook is not alone in taking this approach to improving AI . A recent article in ExtremeTech described the "" thought vector "" work Google 's doing as a way of training computers to comprehend language , which they are incapable of doing now . <h> The future of AI <p> But language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same intellectual tasks that humans perform . Developing a common sense program , or "" artificial general intelligence , "" as it 's called , is still a way 's off , said LeCun , who shared the EmTech stage with Eric Horvitz , director at the Microsoft Research laboratory in Redmond , Wash . "" If Eric were to grab his water bottle and walk off stage , you could close your eyes , be told that , and picture all of the actions he 'd have to take to do that . "" AI machines , on the other hand , ca n't . <p> "" The best way we can think of to train computers to be able to do that is to have them watch a lot of videos . Prediction is the essence of intelligence , and that 's what we 're trying to do , "" LeCun said . <p> Sci-fi films such as Her and Ex Machina may give the impression that the future of AI is conscious machines , but LeCun and Horvitz described generalized intelligence as really hard problems to solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that through , "" Horvitz said . "" I do think that with the great work on the long-term road toward intelligence , we 'll have competencies , new kinds of machines , and it may well be that deep competency is perceived as consciousness . "" <p> Eric Horvitz <p> One of the basic obstacles Horvitz is interested in solving is a classic IT problem : AI technologies were essentially built in silos .

"<h> Tweet This <p> Recruiters are typically naturally outgoing and extroverted individuals with the drive to find right fitting candidates for roles they 're trying to fill . Their ability to connect and build relationships is what makes them the best people for their job . While this comes naturally for common positions such as sales and customer-facing roles , the real challenge comes for technical driven positions . Candidates with technical backgrounds lean favorably on hard skills and often times are more introverted . <p> This poses a challenge for human resource professionals due to their lack of technical knowledge when it comes to sourcing and recruiting candidates . As the key point of contact , it 's crucial recruiters can build a relationship and share common ground with talent through technical knowledge . <p> Here are three secrets to capturing the attention and creating a lasting impression for today 's top tech talent <p> Position Yourself As An Expert <p> It 's easy to forget technical roles are by nature more introverted and less competitive . This common mistake can be detrimental to the reputation and success of a recruiter . When a prospective candidate senses a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their only focus is making their quota , it creates tension between them and the recruiter . <p> In an industry where demand for tech talent is rapidly rising , recruiters should strive to stand out among their competition . Their goal should be positioning themselves as an expert in their field . They can start by taking advantage of LinkedIn Learning courses , conducting research and attending conferences and networking events to gain a deeper understanding of what they 're looking for . Staying up to date on trade publications is another way to stay abreast of the latest industry news and stay in the know . This has a dual effect as it keeps their name at the top of mind in the community while developing their skills as a recruiter . <p> Speak Their Language <p> Most talent with strong technical backgrounds are n't actively seeking out new positions . This is because they 're already in high demand and have had the opportunity to make the choice of the type of company they want to work for , challenging recruiters and HR professionals to get creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best talent , recruiters have to put themselves directly in front of them . They can do this by attending hack-a-thons , industry events and leveraging networking tools such as LinkedIn . <p> Barbara Bruno led a LinkedIn Learning Course , "" Technical Recruiting "" , where she mentioned college graduates receive around 20 offers from companies putting their newly acquired tech skills in high demand . If recent college graduates are receiving a high volume of offers with little to no experience , one can only imagine the volume experienced professionals receive on a daily basis . This is typically why they keep their social media profiles vague , to keep the overwhelm of messages and requests out . If recruiters want to stand out from the other messages , they have to speak the candidate 's language and avoid an instant sales pitch . <p> Start by conducting background research on the candidate beyond their resume . Get familiar with their online portfolios , LinkedIn profiles , GitHub activity and weave in the information gained into the initial pitch . Capture their attention making them want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested , use a "" what 's in it for me "" approach by selling them on how valuable their experience and background is and how this position is a better fit for them based on their needs . <p> An often-overlooked strategy is asking current employees for referrals . Current employees have a network of talent sitting right inside of their social circle . Asking for an introduction helps bridge the gap and eliminate time wasted by putting quality candidates right in front of them . <p> Empower Efficiency with Automation <p> To help strengthen the role of the recruiter in business , companies should prioritize the investment into tools and resources that support the internal network of their HR team . Most HR professionals fear artificial intelligence ( AI ) will replace them but Head of Business Development at GetICV , Amit Mizrahi , counters this myth asserting AI helps "" empower recruiters to focus on what really matters -- finding the right cultural fit for the company and having the best people onboarding for teams . "" <p> Automating HR practices and partnering with AI can increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best talent quickly , providing screening solutions freeing up recruiter 's time and utilizing systems , keywords and processes without the need for extensive tech knowledge . <p> Resumes are filled with dozens of technical terms but when it comes down to a candidate 's actual amount of experience in each skill , typically they 've barely scratched the surface .

The company attributed the decline largely to the pandemic 's effects across its three business units , HVAC , refrigeration , and fire and security . Adjusted for one-time items , including restructuring charges , net income declined 54% to $286 million , or $0.33 per share . <p> Free cash flow , however , remained rather robust and resilient .

The COVID crisis has underscored the importance of quality HVAC systems in maintaining healthier indoor air quality . And global warming could increase sales of air-conditioning systems . <p> Investors do n't have long to wait for material news .

"<h> Abstract <p> How language has evolved into more than 7000 varieties today remains a question that puzzles linguists , anthropologists , and evolutionary scientists . The genetic-biasing hypothesis of language evolution postulates that genes and language features coevolve , such that a population that is genetically predisposed to perceiving a particular linguistic feature would tend to adopt that feature in their language . Statistical studies that correlated a large number of genetic variants and linguistic features not only generated this hypothesis but also specifically pinpointed a linkage between ASPM and lexical tone . However , there is currently no direct evidence for this association and , therefore , the hypothesis . In an experimental study , we provide evidence to link ASPM with lexical tone perception in a sample of over 400 speakers of a tone language . In addition to providing the first direct evidence for the genetic-biasing hypothesis , our results have implications for further studies of linguistic anthropology and language disorders . <h> INTRODUCTION <p> According to a recent estimate , there are currently 7111 known living languages in the world ( 1 ) . These languages are diverse in structural features ( 2 ) such as word order ( e.g. , English , but not Korean , follows a canonical subject-verb-object order ) and sound ( e.g. , Cantonese , but not English , uses pitch to contrast word meaning ) . Insights into the factors that modulate these typological differences have implications for the origin of language , human evolution , and population genetics . One controversial , hypothesized driving factor of typological differences and language evolution is genetic diversity at the population level . Specifically , it has been postulated that a linguistic feature appears or is retained in a language because the population that speaks that language is genetically predisposed to an enhanced ability to process that feature ( 3 , 4 ) . Thus far , evidence for this genetic-biasing hypothesis comes from statistical analysis of the correlation between genetic variation and linguistic typological variation at the population level ( 3 ) and , to some extent , computational modeling of gene and language coevolution ( 5 ) . As fundamental as these studies are in formulating the genetic-basing hypothesis , direct evidence of linkage between genes and linguistic features has yet to emerge . The present study aims to collect this direct evidence with human participants . If individual linguistic features can not be shown to be influenced by genetic variations , the genetic-biasing hypothesis can not be established . <p> In generating the genetic-biasing hypothesis , Dediu and Ladd ( 3 ) analyzed a large database of 983 alleles and 26 linguistic features in 49 populations . Notably , they found a significant correlation between two alleles and lexical tone , even after controlling for geographical and historical factors . Lexical tones are pitch patterns that are used by speakers to contrast word meaning . Languages that use lexical tones , called tone languages , comprise at least half of the world 's languages ( 6 ) and are more concentrated in Central Africa and East Asia . Dediu and Ladd ( 3 ) found that populations that have a lower frequency of the derived allele of two genes that are associated with microcephaly , ASPM ( rs41310927 ) and MCPH1 ( rs930557 ) , are more likely to speak a tone language . <p> Studies of the molecular and cellular functions of ASPM and MCPH1 , mostly focusing on their orthologs and homologs in Drosophila and mice , have revealed their roles in mitosis ( 7 -- 8 ) . Both genes are expressed in the cerebral cortical ventricular zone and proliferative zones ( 9 ) and play crucial roles in normal neurogenesis ( 10 -- 12 ) . Loss-of-function mutations of both genes cause primary microcephaly ( 9 , 13 , 14 ) . Curiously , although the derived alleles of ASPM and MCPH1 are specific to humans and have been implicated in the adaptive evolution of the human brain ( 15 -- 16 ) , earlier experimental attempts failed to find connections of these allelic variations in overall brain size either in adults ( 17 -- 18 ) or in children ( 19 ) . A more recent study found the effect of ASPM mutations on neuroanatomical measures to be nonuniform across regions of the brain , with the auditory cortex transverse temporal gyrus ( also known as Heschl 's gyrus ) and the lateral surface of the temporal lobe being more affected than the structures of the medial temporal lobe ( 20 ) . These neuroanatomical findings in respect of the auditory cortex converge with the lexical tone findings by Dediu and Ladd ( 3 ) , as the pitch center in primates is located in the Heschl 's gyrus ( 21 ) . A smaller volume of the Heschl 's gryus is associated with poorer lexical tone learning in European Americans who had no prior knowledge of a tone language ( 22 ) . Furthermore , in a small-scale study of 32 participants , polymorphisms of ASPM ( rs41310927 ) were found to be associated with pitch pattern perception in European Americans who did not speak a tone language ( see Discussion for details of this study ) ( 23 ) . <p> Because of feasibility and ethical concerns of testing human participants , evolutionary studies often rely on inductive reasoning based on the deployment of advanced analytics that can handle large datasets . Inductive reasoning provides an important first step in formulating a hypothesis of gene-behavior associations of evolutionary significance . To more definitively test these gene-behavior associations , it has been argued that deductive approaches of hypothesis-driven experimentations are needed ( 17 ) . Although fundamental in proposing the genetic-biasing hypothesis of language evolution with evidence from a gene-tone association from inductive reasoning ( 3 ) , direct experimental evidence of the hypothesized tone perception function of ASPM is still lacking . <p> In the present study , we use a hypothesis-driven approach in our study of microcephaly gene-tone association . If our hypothesis is correct , it would provide direct evidence for the genetic-biasing hypothesis of language evolution ( 3 , 4 ) . On the basis of findings of previous studies , we hypothesize that genes that are associated with microcephaly , especially the exonic single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) rs41310927 of ASPM , are expressed in the pitch center of the auditory cortex , and their polymorphisms lead to differential pitch perceptual abilities across individuals . Because of their pitch perception functions , populations with a specific pattern of polymorphisms of microcephaly-related genes would be more likely to exploit pitch in their language , as was indicated by the Dediu and Ladd study ( 3 ) . <p> We tested over 400 adult native speakers of Cantonese , a tone language that has an inventory of six lexical tones , one of the largest tonal inventories of all tone languages ( 24 ) . The participants were asked to perform lexical tone , music ( rhythm and pitch ) , and general cognitive tasks ( Table 1 ) . Information about their musical background was also obtained . In addition to microcephaly-related genes that have been implicated in previous studies especially ASPM ( rs41310927 ) , we also examined a number of genes that have been hypothesized to be related to general cognitive and language processing . This design , involving multiple tasks and multiple genes , allows us to ascertain the specificity of the hypothesized gene-tone association . <h> RESULTS <p> We examined the association between lexical tone perception and SNPs of a group of microcephaly-related genes whose hypothesized functions concern the brain ( 20 , 25 , 26 ) , pitch ( 23 ) , and lexical tone ( Table 2 ) ( 3 ) . As one control procedure , we examined the association of these SNPs with three other auditory-based behaviors ( musical pitch perception , rhythm perception , and auditory working memory ) . Of particular interest is ASPM ( rs41310927 ) because of the two previous studies that implicate its tone- and pitch-related functions ( 3 , 23 ) . As another control procedure , we examined the associations between the four auditory phenotypes with a group of genes that are associated with ( 28 -- 30 ) or hypothesized to be associated with ( 31 ) broad language functions or disorders ( henceforth "" control SNPs "" ; see table S1 ) . Genotype-phenotype associations were examined via the convergence of the general linear model ( GLM ) and machine learning prediction analysis . <p> Table 2SNPs of microcephaly-related genes that are hypothesized to be associated with lexical tone perception . <p> Information for the alleles is obtained from the latest dbSNP database published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( United States ) for East Asians or based on our current sample . <h> General linear model <p> We constructed separate multiple linear regression models for each of the four different auditory behaviors ( dependent variables ) , using the microcephaly-related SNPs , age , gender , intelligence quotient ( IQ ) , and years of musical training as independent variables . For lexical tone perception , a significant model fit was found ( adjusted R2 = 0.168 , P &lt; 0.001 ) , with IQ ( corrected P = 0.007 ) , years of musical training ( corrected P &lt; 0.001 ) , and the minor allele load of rs41310927 ( corrected P = 0.039 ) showing significant associations after correction for multiple comparisons ( Table 3 ) . No significant model fit was found for musical pitch ( table S2 ) . A significant model fit was found for rhythm ( adjusted R2 = 0.032 , P = 0.018 ) , with IQ ( uncorrected P = 0.008 ) and years of musical training ( uncorrected P = 0.017 ) showing significant associations ( neither survived after correction for multiple comparisons ) ( see table S3 ) . The model for auditory working memory ( table S4 ) was not significant . After correction for multiple comparisons , no significant associations were found for any SNPs with any auditory behaviors , except for rs41310927 and lexical tone perception . There were no significant associations found in multiple linear regression models using the control SNPs as independent variables and any of the four auditory behaviors as dependent variables ( tables S5 to S8 ) . <p> Table 3Summary of the multiple linear regression model with lexical tone as the dependent variable . <p> We then constructed a stepwise regression model for lexical tone with the same set of independent variables ( all of the hypothesized SNPs , age , gender , IQ , and years of musical training ) as the multiple linear regression models discussed above . Years of musical training with IQ contributed to the first two models that explained up to 15.6% of variance in lexical tone perception . The final significant model had rs41310927 explaining another 1.4% of variance ( adjusted R2 = 0.170 ) ( Table 4 ) . Figure 1A shows lexical tone performance by the rs41310927 allele groups . <p> Table 4Summary of the stepwise regression model with lexical tone as the dependent variable . <p> ( A ) Mean accuracy of lexical tone perception of TT carriers ( mean = 87.68% , SD = 10.17 ) is significantly higher than TC/CC carriers ( mean = 83.99% , SD = 12.01 , t = 2.97 , P = 0.003 , Cohen 's d = 0.33 ) . ( B ) Prediction of tone perception using predictors showing significant associations with tone perception using SVR . The predictability was estimated by the correlation coefficients ( cc ) between the predicted and the observed tone perception scores . Results show that with only SNP rs41310927 , the distribution of prediction values ( green ) was significantly different ( P = 0.019 ) from the null distribution ( gray ) . With IQ and years of musical training , the distribution of prediction value ( blue ) was much higher and was also significantly different ( P &lt; 0.001 ) from the null distribution . <h> Machine learning prediction analysis <p> The aforementioned GLM analysis results all suggested a significant association between rs41310927 and lexical tone perception , along with IQ and years of musical training . To obtain converging evidence from multiple types of analytics , we used machine learning support vector regression ( SVR ) . Predictability is estimated by the Pearson correlation coefficients ( cc ) between predicted and observed lexical tone performance . The higher the cc values are , the more accurate the predictive performance of the SVR model is . With IQ and years of musical training as predictors , the predicted cc ( mean = 0.375 ) was significantly different from the null distribution ( P &lt; 0.001 ) ( Fig. 1B ) . With only SNP rs41310927 as the predictor , the distribution of predicted cc ( mean = 0.088 ) was also significantly different ( P = 0.019 ) from the null distribution , although as expected , the predicted cc with one SNP was much lower than when the other two variables were used as predictors . <p> To summarize , in both GLM and machine learning analyses , we found musical training along with IQ to be the most significant contributors of lexical tone performance , as predicted by previous studies ( 32 , 33 ) . Although the contribution was much smaller , rs41310927 was significantly associated with lexical tone perception , after the effects of IQ and musical training were accounted for , with the minor allele C contributing negatively to lexical tone perception . A convergence of analytics confirmed these findings . No other significant associations were found between any other SNPs and lexical tone , or any SNPs with any auditory behaviors examined . The association between rs41310927 seems to be specific and is unrelated to general auditory functions . The odds ratios ( ORs ) for an rs41310927 C allele carrier performing below the mean or 1 SD below the mean on the lexical tone perception task are 2.13 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.38 to 3.29 and 1.90 ( 95% CI , 1.11 to 3.26 ) , respectively . <h> DISCUSSION <p> In a hypothesis-driven manner , our study provides the first evidence linking a genetic variant with a linguistic feature , as far as we are aware , providing the most direct support for the genetic-biasing hypothesis of language evolution to date . The association between the genetic variant that we studied , ASPM ( rs41310927 ) , and the lexical tone perception has already been implicated in two previous studies . The first one was a population-level correlational study ( 3 ) that did not examine the function of the gene but was nevertheless foundational in generating the current hypothesis . The second was a small-scale study that linked nonlexical pitch perception with this variant in non -- tone-speaking European Americans ( see below for discussion of potential discrepancies between this study and the present study ) ( 23 ) . The present study is the third study to examine ASPM ( rs41310927 ) and the first experimental study to examine the genetic impact of ASPM ( rs41310927 ) on a large group of native tone language speakers perceiving lexical tone . The significant association remained even after musical experience and IQ were controlled for . Although we are not claiming an exclusive association , our results suggest that the association between this genetic variant and lexical tone is quite specific . That is , this association seems to be related to perceiving pitch patterns within a syllable-level time frame and holding that pitch information across two to three syllables . The variant is not associated with general musical abilities that require attending sequences of notes , pitch , or rhythm in a longer , phrasal context . It is also not associated with general auditory working memory . Lexical tone perception is also not associated with other genes that have been implicated in general language functions ( e.g. , CNTNAP2 ) . <p> A number of previous studies have examined the association between genes and language-related phenotypes . For example , one study found an association between CNTNAP2 and non -- word repetition and developmental language disorder more broadly ( 28 ) . A previous study identified FOXP2 and a severe form of verbal apraxia ( 34 ) . These studies provided strong evidence of the genetic basis of general language and cognitive skills and disorders , but they did not refer specifically to a linguistic feature . Likewise , Stein et al . ( 35 ) studied the association between variants of ASPM ( excluding rs41310927 , which we studied here ) and a number of broad language skills . In contrast to the studies of CNTNAP2 and FOXP2 , Stein et al . ( 35 ) did not find any significant associations between ASPM and general language behaviors . <p> It is important to emphasize that support for the genetic-biasing hypothesis must include findings that link linguistic features , rather than general auditory , language , or cognitive functions , with genes . Essentially , this hypothesis explains how different languages have evolved to lead to these diverse sets of linguistic features and presents a genetic explanation for their evolution . Population-level differences in allele frequencies of certain genes may change the probability of associations with specific linguistic features . This change in association may provide part of an explanation for some typological differences of languages . In our case , the frequency of the T and C alleles of rs41310927 has been reported to be around 59 and 41% for Europeans ( 36 ) and 84 and 16% in our sample of over 400 Han Chinese , respectively . Our study reveals that the T allele enhances lexical tone perception abilities in Han Chinese who speak a tone language as their native language . Note that other genetic variants that we studied also showed differences in allele frequencies across populations , but none were significantly associated with lexical tones . For example , the frequency of the major allele in East Asian and European populations are , respectively , 72 and 50% for COMT ( rs4680 ) , 94 and 46% for DRD2 ( rs6277 ) , and 73 and 52% for ATP2C2 ( rs11860694 ) . This further indicates a specific relationship between rs41310927 and lexical tone . <p> Note that by far the strongest modulating effect of lexical tone perception was musical experience . This is in line with previous research suggesting a connection between music and lexical tone . We found that musicians who were native English-speaking adults with no experience of a tone language were able to learn a tone language better ( 32 ) , and their auditory system encoded lexical tones more accurately ( 37 ) than their counterparts with little or no musical training . Cantonese speakers were also better at musical pitch ( but not rhythm ) perception than French and English speakers , after the musical and educational background was controlled for , presumably due to their experience of speaking a tone language ( 27 ) . Caldwell-Harris et al . ( 33 ) found that heritage speakers of a tone language were able to notice pitch differences in a new tone language in the "" exposure phase "" of an implicit learning experiment better than Asian learners without a tone language background . Their results suggest that auditory and language experience played a larger role in lexical tone learning than genetics . Nevertheless , even after musical experience was accounted for , our results suggest that the influence of genetics can not be altogether discounted . As expected , the effect size was small and within the limits of the variance attributable to a single SNP as far as human cognitive abilities are concerned . Okbay et al . ( 38 ) found that the 74 SNPs that they examined together explained only 4% of the variance in educational attainment ( an average of 0.05% variance explained ) . After the contribution of musical experience and IQ , rs41310927 explained about 1.4% of the variance in lexical tone perception , which is substantially more than the average SNP documented by Okbay et al . ( 38 ) . We do not expect the ASPM SNP that we examined to be the only SNP associated with lexical tone nor did we expect it to not contribute to any other functions . The significance of the current findings is that we have provided the strongest evidence to date connecting a gene and a linguistic feature and that this association is unlikely to be of a general purpose nature . Our results are also in line with previous gene-brain research that found APSM to be expressed in the auditory cortex ( 20 , 23 ) . <p> Although the present study and our previous , smaller-scale study ( 23 ) both found a significant association between lexical ( pitch ) perception and ASPM , the association was in opposite directions . Most notably , the direction of the current findings is consistent with the direction hypothesized by Dediu and Ladd ( 3 ) for native tone speakers . There are at least two explanations for this discrepancy . First , as explained in Wong et al . ( 23 ) , the same allele could exert a different phenotypic effect due to gene-gene and culture-gene interactions ( 39 -- 41 ) . The participants in Wong et al . ( 23 ) were non -- tone-speaking European Americans , whereas the participants in the present study were tone-speaking Han Chinese . Second , as argued by Caldwell-Harris et al . ( 33 ) , the association between ASPM and lexical tone concerns a phenotype requiring the listeners to integrate pitch with the rest of the syllable . On the contrary , the AX task used by Wong et al . ( 23 ) required the non -- tone-speaking participants to perform the opposite , namely , segregating rather than integrating pitch with the syllable . This explanation is further supported by previous studies showing tone language speakers ' inability to ignore tonal differences when a task required them to only attend to segmental information , a phenomenon known as segmental-suprasegmental integration ( 42 , 43 ) . To further boost tonal integration in the syllable , the present study incorporated an ABX task , which required the participants to retain tonal information within a syllable for a longer period of time in memory . This change in task , as well as the tendency of tone language speakers ( but not non -- tone language speakers ) to integrate pitch with the syllable , may explain the discrepancy between the present study and our previous study ( 23 ) . Further research is required to disentangle whether ASPM-tone association is related to more basic pitch perception or whether it is specific to higher-level phonological pitch processing . As native and nonnative listeners approach tasks of different levels of suprasegmental processing differently ( e.g. , AX versus ABX ) even in nontone suprasegmental domains such as stress ( 44 -- 46 ) , future research should carefully consider the interaction between task demand and language background of the participants to understand the specific phenotype being investigated and its association with genes . In the present study , we use the term "" perception "" to describe our task , because the participants were not explicitly required to conduct phonological or lexical tone processing . <p> Besides providing direct evidence for the genetic-biasing hypothesis of language evolution , the present study may also have clinical and educational implications . In the case of tone language speakers , poor tone perception is associated with a number of communication disorders , including developmental language disorder ( 47 ) and autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) ( 48 ) . As indicated by the ORs , carriers of the C allele of ASPM ( rs41310927 ) have a higher risk of lower tone perception performance . The OR of about 2 that we obtained is comparable to or higher than those individual SNPs that have the highest ORs for Alzheimer 's disease ( 49 ) and ASD ( 50 ) . Thus , future research might investigate whether ASPM is a candidate gene for communication disorders and whether it is a genetic marker specific to individuals who speak a tone language ( but not individuals who speak a nontone language ) . In addition to being a linguistic feature , lexical tone perception may be an endophenotype of the more complex language disorders . Studies of endophenotypes have proven to be fruitful in the study of the genetic basis of schizophrenia ( 51 -- 52 ) and ASD ( 53 ) and are also believed to be promising for language as well ( 54 ) . <p> Our findings may also have implications for personalized learning ( 55 ) . In an exploratory ( post hoc ) analysis , we investigated the potential differential modulating effects of musical training on lexical tone in carriers of the T and C alleles . As the T allele favored tone perception , it is possible that musical training would be less likely to improve the tone perception of the T allele carriers . As shown in Fig. 2 , musical training seems to interact with genotype , so that C allele carriers seem to have benefited more from musical training , as far as the tone-enhancing effect of musical training is concerned . The implication for personalized learning is that carriers of the C allele should consider receiving musical training to potentially prevent a tone perception disorder and to enhance learning . Future research should be specifically designed to further investigate this hypothesis . <p> The x axis indicates participants without musical training and with at least 1 year of musical training , separated by allele group of rs41310927 . A significant music ? gene interaction was found F(404) = 7.28 , P = 0.007 . <p> In conclusion , we found direct evidence of gene-tone association , providing the critical direct evidence for the genetic-biasing hypothesis of language evolution . We hypothesize that ASPM is expressed in the pitch center of the auditory cortex ( 20 ) , which would , in turn , enhance the lexical tone perception of carriers of the favored allele . Populations with a higher frequency of the favored allele would be more likely to have lexical tone in their language . In addition to the two previous studies implicating the role of ASPM in pitch and tone perception ( 3 , 23 ) , our results are also consistent with a computational modeling study of language evolution , suggesting that tone is less likely to be affected by historical and geographical factors and more likely to be influenced by speaker-internal factors in its evolution ( 4 ) . Future studies might fruitfully attempt to identify more tone-related genes and also genes for other linguistic features to provide further support for the genetic-biasing hypothesis . Future studies may also consider how genetic and environment factors ( 56 ) interact in driving typological differences . <h> MATERIALS AND METHODS <h> Participants <p> A total of 426 ( 331 females ) individuals were recruited . All participants were reported to be native speakers of Cantonese of Han Chinese decent without hearing , neurological , or psychiatric disorders . Informed consent was obtained from each participant . The age of the participants ranged from 18 to 27 years with an average age of 20.82 years ( SD = 1.44 ) . We estimated the nonverbal intelligence ( henceforth IQ ) of each participant by using the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence ( Fourth Edition ) ( 57 ) ; all participants scored within normal limits . All participants also passed a hearing screening at 25 dB HL ( decibels in hearing level ) for the frequencies of 250 , 1000 , 2000 , and 4000 Hz in a sound booth . Each participant reported how many years of musical training they had received , if any . Not every measure contained data from all participants . Tables 1 and 2 and table S1 state how many participants were included in each measure . Reasons for missing data included DNA quality , inability to complete all tasks due to fatigue , incomplete data submission by the participants , and coding errors . Our sample size was determined by assuming the use of independent two-sample t tests for behavioral differences across two genotypic groups . We assumed the minor allele frequency to be 0.3 ( in our current sample , 29% of the participants had at least one minor allele of rs41310927 ) . The effect size was estimated by examining three relevant published studies ( 23 , 25 , 26 ) , ranging from 0.26 to 0.84 . The mean effect size of 0.47 was used in our sample size estimation . With nine hypothesized SNPs and four phenotypes , the Bonferroni-corrected alpha was 0.0014 ( uncorrected a = 0.05 ) . With 13 control SNPs and four phenotypes , the Bonferroni corrected alpha was 0.00096 . Therefore a corrected alpha of 0.001 was used in our final estimation . According to this estimation , 372 participants were required to achieve the detection power of 80% . Thus , our final sample size of 426 participants allowed us to detect potentially significant results even with missing data of up to 15% . The research protocol was approved by the Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong -- New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee . <h> Behavioral measures <p> All participants were tested on two pitch-related and two non -- pitch-related behavioral auditory experiments to examine domain generality and specificity of the hypothesized genotype-phenotype associations . The experiments were administered using a Windows laptop with a screen size of 15 inches . Participants were instructed to wear a Sennheiser headphone during the study . They were offered a 5-min break after the completion of each task . The order of the tasks was counterbalanced . <p> Lexical tone perception . In an ABX task , participants were asked to judge in each three-syllable trial whether the tone of the last syllable was the same as the first or the second syllable . The last syllable matched the first/second syllable in 50% of the trials . Lexical tone was the only dimension that varied across the three syllables in a trial . All syllables were pseudowords ( words that obeyed Cantonese phonological rules but had no meaning ) in Cantonese . The syllables were originally produced by a native female speaker of Cantonese in her mid-20s . These syllables were subsequently resynthesized to normalize duration and amplitude . Each syllable was 400 ms long . In total , there were 204 trials . The task lasted for approximately 15 min . Chance performance level was 50% . <p> Musical pitch perception . In each trial , participants listened to a pair of melodies composed in the Western tonal ( 6 trials ) , pentatonic ( 6 trials ) , and atonal ( 12 trials ) scales . In 50% of the trials , the two melodies in each pair were completely identical . In the other 50% , the melodies were almost identical , except that one note had a different pitch to its counterpart . The participants were asked to indicate whether the two melodies were identical . Each melody lasted about 11 s . In total , there were 24 trials . The task lasted for approximately 12 min . Chance performance level was 50% . <p> Rhythm perception . This task closely followed the musical pitch task , except for the different trials , where the melodies differed in time ( rhythm ) rather than in musical pitch . The melodies were composed in the Western tonal ( six trials ) and pentatonic ( six trials ) scales . Each melody lasted for approximately 11 s . In total , there were 12 trials . The task lasted for approximately 8 min . Chance performance level was 50% . <p> Running working memory . We adapted an auditory working memory task ( 58 ) . The participants listened to trials of three to seven letters ( D , F , J , K , L , N , P , Q , and R ) that were presented sequentially with a 200-ms interstimulus interval in a randomized order . The letters were normalized for intensity and duration ( 600 ms ) . After all letters were presented , a response screen appeared and reminded the participants how many letters to report . The responses of the task were constrained only to a forward order . Participants were required to recall the letters in the exact sequence as the order of presentation . They typed the letters in the response box on their screens using a keyboard . In total , the participants finished 15 trials including 75 letters in total . The task lasted 15 min . One point was given for each item correctly recalled in the correct position of the trial . For example , if four letters -- D , N , F , and R -- were to be reported , participants who responded "" D , Q , F , and R "" would receive 3 points , but those who responded "" D , F , and R "" would receive only 1 point .

"<h> In Search of the Perfect Search : Can Google Beat Attempts to Game the System ? <p> Under fire after a series of well-publicized schemes revealed flaws in the effectiveness of its search results , Google is taking action . The search giant recently overhauled its ranking procedures in what company executives called an effort to favor "" high quality "" sites over those that are "" not very useful , "" a move Google says will noticeably impact the ranking of results in nearly 12% of all Google queries in the United States . <p> The change , which was announced on February 24 , went beyond the minor tweaks Google frequently makes that are often invisible to the average user . The company is trying to address fallout from issues that have recently come to light , most notably in a New York Times report that showed how department store chain J.C . Penney became a top search result in many queries by "" gaming "" the search engine . In a separate incident , retailer Overstock.com was punished by Google for going against policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search engine , The Wall Street Journal reported . <p> Many technology commentators also have recently criticized Google for allowing spam and low-quality content into its search results . Google has responded by saying it would downplay results from sites often known as "" content farms "" -- that is , sites such as Demand Media and Associated Content that produce large volumes of quickly written articles constructed according to how they will rank in search results . <p> These incidents , and Google 's responses , raise a bevy of questions . How much does search quality matter -- and to whom ? Does Google have too much market power ? Should the company be more transparent about the algorithm that selects its top search results ? What is the future of search ? <p> "" Google 's search business depends on satisfying two constituencies : users and advertisers , "" says Kevin Werbach , a legal studies and business ethics professor at Wharton . "" Google is the dominant search engine , but if users find they ca n't get to the results they want , they will explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't bid up the prices of search keywords . Google 's value proposition is based on being a neutral ' honest broker ' of good search results . "" <p> Experts at Wharton say the increasing attention being paid to Google 's search results highlights the cat-and-mouse game between the company and those who attempt to game its secret algorithm that determines the order in which search results are displayed . The practice , known as search engine optimization ( SEO ) , uses a range of techniques for creating web pages that increase the likelihood the site will appear among the top results displayed in response to search engine queries . There are plenty of legitimate SEO techniques which adhere to Google 's best practices . There are also "" black hat "" techniques that aim to take advantage of quirks in the search rank algorithms to artificially gain a higher spot in the query results and garner more traffic for a website . <p> The ultimate impact of Google 's move to prevent the gaming of search results is yet to be determined , according to panelists at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to Luke Beatty , a vice president at Yahoo 's Associated Content , one third of the site 's content ranks higher on Google as a result of the change , but two thirds has garnered a lower position . Jason Rapp , president of search engine Mahalo , told conference attendees that the company laid off 10% of its workforce and changed its strategy after the algorithm adjustments . "" We had a body of general-interest content that was affected rather significantly , "" Rapp noted . "" When we see a hit like that , we react accordingly . "" <p> According to Kartik Hosanagar , a Wharton operations and information management professor , the focus on Google 's search quality is a bit ironic considering how the company originally rose to prominence . "" If you look at how Google started out and became so successful , it was because of its PageRank algorithm , "" says Hosanagar , referring to the analysis of links across the web the search giant uses to determine a site 's importance , and to decide where pages appear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results . Previous search engines at Yahoo and elsewhere were easily littered with spam and low-quality content . "" <p> Now Google may be facing the same issue that its predecessors grappled with more than a decade ago . "" Search quality is critical to Google 's reputation , "" Hosanagar notes . "" Quality is really fundamental to Google 's dominance in the market . "" <p> In January , Google accounted for 68.2% of U.S. searches , according to research firm comScore . Bolstered by its partnership with Yahoo , Microsoft 's Bing search site had a 25.6% share . "" People would n't put so much effort into gaming Google if it did n't matter as much as it does , "" says Kendall Whitehouse , director of new media at Wharton . "" Because Google is so dominant in search , if you 're not easily found there , for all practical purposes , your website is invisible . "" <h> Sponsored Content : <p> For that reason , Google 's algorithm overhaul is quite significant , notes Wharton operations and information management professor Eric Clemons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AdSense Google 's ad serving application for websites is a good thing . The consumer is better off without content farms . That makes Google better off without them . "" <p> For now , Google is trying to resolve the issue by instituting set rules to weed out problem content from popping up in searches . "" When we try to address challenges like this , we try to do it in an algorithmic way . There may be one-off situations where for legal reasons ... we will intervene manually , "" Neal Mohan , Google 's vice president of product management , said on February 28 at the Morgan Stanley Technology , Media and Telecommunications Conference . Wharton 's Whitehouse underscores the difficulty facing Google in distinguishing between good quality content and bad . "" We tend to blame Google "" for less than perfect search results , "" but knowing what a search user thinks is the ' right ' answer is n't trivial to implement through software . "" Because content quality can not completely be judged by an algorithm , Google added a feature on March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like . <p> Does Power Corrupt ? <p> Google is the primary way to find information on the Internet , and that gives the company a lot of power . Naturally , that power attracts players trying to use Google 's system to their advantage . Hosanagar likens Google in search to Microsoft in security : Both are targeted because they are dominant . <p> Indeed , a company like Demand Media , which marshals an army of freelancers to produce search-friendly articles , cites dependence on Google as one of the firm 's biggest business risks . Demand Media 's initial public offering coincided with Google 's statements that it would crack down on content farms . On Demand Media 's first earnings conference call on February 22 , CEO Richard Rosenblatt emphasized that the company is diversifying its traffic sources . <p> Clemons has argued in various publications that Google has too much power . He notes that Google has the ability to censor results with editorial judgments that are layered onto its algorithm , and those judgments can make or break businesses that depend on the search engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal studies and business ethics professor , there is a tension in Google 's technology between "" preserving the purity of the algorithm "" and using editorial judgments "" to address social policy concerns and bad actors . "" <p> For instance , Google significantly lowered J.C . Penney 's ranking in several queries after the New York Times article highlighted the scheme that was pushing the retailer 's website to the top of the results for many search terms . The department store chain denied involvement in the scheme , but the company subsequently ended its relationship with its search engine consulting firm . Matwyshyn thinks Google 's reasoning has been sound so far , but warns : "" It 's inevitable that Google will label something erroneously and cause economic harm to a company it downgrades . The whole question is what constitutes editorial judgment . "" <p> Matwyshyn adds that Google 's legal obligations when tweaking its ranking algorithm and making editorial adjustments are still a gray area . "" To date , this topic has n't been explored in law , but it needs to be resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Google said that it would downplay low-quality content , important questions were raised , Whitehouse notes . "" What is the unassailable definition of ' low-value content ? ' "" he asks . Google publishes rules that govern its policies , but generally does not comment on specific actions against websites . Hosanagar predicts that the search giant will continue to be targeted because there are real business returns in trying to subvert the system . "" Search is the primary means to the Internet . "" <p> Does Google have too much power ? Indeed , Clemons considers the company to have a near monopoly . Google executives , however , have continually argued that switching to another search provider is easy . "" Google is a for-profit enterprise providing a service . No one has to use Google . It can do what it wants , "" says Wharton entrepreneurship professor Karl Ulrich . "" The risk is that if its results are viewed as incomplete , rival search engines could gain share . Google has a lot of market power because of its market share . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low . Thus , the moment Google does not provide the best search experience , users will migrate to alternatives . "" <p> But Matwyshyn suggests that it might not be that simple for some users . She notes that while those "" who use Google purely as a search engine can find a substitute , "" Google customers that also use the company 's e-mail , document , photo and video services may find it more difficult to switch to another search engine . <p> The Ideal Search <p> Some experts at Wharton wonder if Google is transparent enough . Google frequently revamps its ranking techniques to improve search results . In general , Google tells the public about changes in its procedures , and publishes a best practices guide for web page creators , but does not divulge much information about the details of how search results are compiled , other than noting that the engine uses more than 200 signals , including its original PageRank algorithm , to order websites . <p> "" I 'm not sure how I feel about relying on an algorithm for something as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , "" says Clemons . Matwyshyn would also like to see more transparency but notes that the algorithm is "" the company 's prime asset . Google has to keep control over the details . "" <p> If Google became more transparent , it might become easier to trick , Hosanagar points out . "" Google seems fully justified in its moves , "" he says . "" When spammers knew the features of search engines at Yahoo and elsewhere , they gamed the system . The low quality content problem precedes Google 's rise to power . "" <p> The challenge for Google , as well as other search engines , is essentially reading the minds of users , and coming up with the most accurate set of results . "" Search needs a new trick , "" Hosanagar notes . "" Just like Google came in with PageRank , some other company could find a different and better way to rank search engine results . "" The ideal search , according to Hosanagar , would feature artificial intelligence . For example , IBM 's Watson supercomputer , best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search engine , although the use of such technology is unlikely to be generally available in the immediate future . <p> In the meantime , search engine providers are tinkering with what Hosanagar calls "" artificial artificial intelligence . "" The general idea is to integrate social networking feeds from Facebook and Twitter "" to infer what human beings are doing , "" he says , noting that social feeds might work to enhance results until a better system is devised . "" The algorithms do n't understand content and ca n't guess what the user wants . "" <p> Some of these social search efforts are already underway . Google in February unveiled an application that integrates Twitter feeds into results . On February 24 , Microsoft 's Bing announced that it would integrate Facebook "" likes "" into search results . If a user logs in to Facebook and then performs a search on Bing , tips and recommendations from friends will appear alongside the results . <p> Social search might improve results , Matwyshyn says , but Google and other companies have to account for users ' privacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versus which are kept private . "" The ideal would be highly individualized results , "" she notes . "" My search will look different than your search , and be tailored to my privacy levels . "" However , "" search is a multidimensional problem , "" Whitehouse points out . "" Is whether a page is the most recent or the most liked by your friends more important than being the definitive statement on a given topic ? It depends on what you 're looking for . There is n't one right answer . "" <p> In the end , Google 's moves to improve search and police any attempts to game its system will be closely watched . "" Because of its dominant position , Google has a heightened responsibility , and its actions will be subject to greater scrutiny , "" says Werbach . "" The key issue is not whether Google has power , but whether it 's abusing that power .

"<h> US must rise to today 's challenges and keep fundamental rights alive <p> With the nation in turmoil over the rights and wrongs of its citizens , the plight of half the world 's population living under authoritarian regimes tends to fade from sight . In the U.S. State Department , however , it remains a center of intense attention . Today the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia , the U.S. Commission on Unalienable Rights , released a report on human rights in foreign policy , pursuant to its charge to furnish the Department with the advice "" grounded in our nation 's founding principles and the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights . "" <p> Though the commissioners , like other Americans , have differing views on many domestic issues , our work was dominated by a common concern for the millions of men and women in countries where the freedoms we take for granted in the U.S. are systematically denied . <p> Countless victims of persecution , torture and arbitrary imprisonment in places where citizens lack even the ability to protest , look to the United States - even with its shortcomings - as a beacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champion the rights they dream of having , especially at this moment when freedom , equality and democracy face strong ideological opposition from powerful states , and when some liberal democracies appear to be placing economic considerations ahead of human rights in their foreign policy . <p> The certainty that American support means so much to so many led the Commission to its principal conclusion : the United States must remain strong in promoting the principles that have enabled free societies to achieve , in the words of the UN Charter and the UDHR , "" better standards of life in larger freedom . "" <p> At the same time , the commissioners were keenly aware that America can be an effective advocate for human rights abroad only if she demonstrates her commitment to those same rights at home .

Besides , international diversification is a major consideration to keep in mind when managing risk at the whole portfolio level . For investors with lots of exposure to U.S. stocks , adding some international presence can be a good idea in order to avoid putting all your eggs in one basket . <p> Many of the most promising investment opportunities can be found in China nowadays , and especially in the Chinese Internet sector , where many businesses are benefiting from enormous opportunities in areas such as online commerce , digital entertainment , social media , digital payments , and all kinds of Artificial Intelligence applications . <p> "" The strongest companies in the world are not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are growing faster .

Short-term uncertainty usually creates opportunities for long-term investors , and this seems to be the case for KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF right now . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CSI China Internet ETF with First Trust DJ Internet Index ETF ( NYSEARCA:FDN ) , it 's easy to see that internet companies in the U.S. have widely outperformed their China counterparts over the past several years . <p> Data by YCharts <p> However , the tables have turned recently , and China Internet stocks are doing much better than their U.S. peers in the short term . <p> Data by YCharts <p> This may sound counterintuitive in times when global stock markets are under a lot of pressure because of fears about COVID-19 and its implications for the economy . How can it be possible that Internet stocks in China - the epicenter of COVID-19 - are performing better than internet stocks in the U.S ? <p> It 's actually very simple .

However , we do n't want the ETF to be too overextended in the short term , so the algorithm gives a -20% weight to the one-month return . <p> The chart below shows the historical returns for ETFs in different ranking segments versus the 60/40 benchmark . ETFs with a high ranking tend to significantly outperform the benchmark , and there is a direct relationship between the ETF Timing ranking and performance . <p> Data from S&amp;P Global via Portfolio123 <p> Making decisions based on momentum can produce some very attractive returns , and there 's solid academic research proving that momentum works well over the long term .

In other words , momentum cuts both ways . That 's just the way the nature of momentum investing . <p> That being acknowledged , KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF has a timing ranking of 95 , meaning that the ETF is in the top 5% of all ETFs listed in the U.S. when considering momentum over different periods . <p> If you are looking for an ETF delivering solid performance in the middle term , but not too overbought in the short term , the price action in KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF fits that description quite well . <h> A Reminder On The Risks <p> Investing in KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF carries some fairly substantial risks .

"<h> Up to 256 chips can be joined together for 11.5 petaflops of machine-learning power . <p> Google has developed its second-generation tensor processor -- four 45-teraflops chips packed onto a 180 TFLOPS tensor processor unit ( TPU ) module , to be used for machine learning and artificial intelligence -- and the company is bringing it to the cloud . TPU-based computation will be available to Google Cloud Compute later this year . <p> Typically in machine-learning workloads , initial training and model building are divided from the subsequent pattern matching against the model . The former workload is the one that is most heavily dependent on massive compute power , and it 's this that has generally been done on GPUs . Google 's first-generation TPUs were used for the second part -- making inferences based on the model , to recognize images , language , or whatever .

"<h> Abstract <p> The human bronchial epithelium is composed of multiple distinct cell types that cooperate to defend against environmental insults . While studies have shown that smoking alters bronchial epithelial function and morphology , its precise effects on specific cell types and overall tissue composition are unclear . We used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile bronchial epithelial cells from six never and six current smokers . Unsupervised analyses led to the characterization of a set of toxin metabolism genes that localized to smoker ciliated cells , tissue remodeling associated with a loss of club cells and extensive goblet cell hyperplasia , and a previously unidentified peri-goblet epithelial subpopulation in smokers who expressed a marker of bronchial premalignant lesions . Our data demonstrate that smoke exposure drives a complex landscape of cellular alterations that may prime the human bronchial epithelium for disease . <h> INTRODUCTION <p> The human bronchus is lined with a pseudostratified epithelium that acts as a physical barrier against exposure to harmful environmental insults such as inhaled toxins , allergens , and pathogens ( 1 , 2 ) . The bronchial epithelium is a complex tissue , predominantly composed of ciliated , goblet , club , and basal epithelial cells . These cell types cooperate to perform mucociliary clearance , which is the process that mediates the capture and removal of inhaled substances ( 1 , 2 ) . Goblet cells secrete components of a mucosal lining that entraps inhaled particulate matter , which is propelled out of the airways by mechanical beating of ciliated cells ( 1 , 2 ) . Club cells have both secretory ( 3 ) and progenitor ( 4 ) functions , and basal cells are multipotent progenitors responsible for normal tissue homeostasis ( 5 -- 7 ) . Interplay among these cells is required for proper function and long-term maintenance of the bronchial epithelium , but exposure to substances , such as tobacco smoke , might alter or injure specific cell types and lead to tissue-wide dysfunction . <p> Inhalation of tobacco smoke exposes the bronchial epithelium to toxins , carcinogens , and free radicals ( 8 -- 11 ) , but cellular injuries and abnormalities associated with this exposure are complex and have not been fully characterized . Previous studies have described smoking-induced epithelial changes , such as increased goblet cell numbers ( 12 -- 14 ) and reduced ciliary length ( 15 , 16 ) . Robust transcriptomic alterations have also been observed in the bronchial epithelium of smokers , involving the up-regulation of genes linked to xenobiotic metabolism and the oxidative stress response ( 17 , 18 ) . Furthermore , it has been reported that a subset of gene expression alterations detected in smokers persists years after smoking cessation ( 18 ) . However , the aforementioned transcriptomic studies profiled bronchial tissue in "" bulk , "" masking cell type -- specific contributions to the smoking-associated gene expression signature . <p> To overcome the limitations of bulk tissue analyses , we used single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-Seq ) to profile the transcriptomes of individual bronchial cells from healthy never and current smokers . We identified bronchial subpopulations using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm and immunostained bronchial tissue from independent cohorts of never and current smokers to validate robust smoking-associated findings . In the airways of smokers , we described a metabolic response specific to ciliated cells , a shift in the presence of club and goblet cells , and the emergence of a previously uncharacterized epithelial subpopulation . <h> RESULTS <h> scRNA-Seq was used to identify bronchial subpopulations in the airways of never and current smokers <p> Bronchial brushings were procured by bronchoscopy from the right mainstem bronchus of six healthy current smokers and six healthy never smokers ( table S1 ) , and single ALCAM+ epithelial cells ( 19 ) and CD45+ white blood cells ( WBCs ) were isolated from each donor ( Fig. 1A and fig . S1 ) . The CEL-Seq scRNA-Seq protocol ( 20 ) was used to profile the transcriptomes of 84 epithelial cells and 11 WBCs from each of the 12 donors ( 1140 total cells : 1008 epithelial cells and 132 WBCs ) . Low-quality cells were excluded from downstream analyses , leaving 796 cells ( 753 epithelial cells and 43 WBCs ) ( figs . S2 and S3 ) expressing an average of 1817 genes per cell . Expression of known marker genes for bronchial cell types was detected in largely nonoverlapping cells , including KRT5 for basal cells , FOXJ1 for ciliated cells , SCGB1A1 for club cells , MUC5AC for goblet cells , and CD45 for WBCs ( Fig. 1B ) . Given the relatively small number of subjects , we sought to determine whether smoking-associated gene expression changes identified in these donors reflected those observed in a larger , independent cohort of never and current smokers . Data from all cells procured from each donor were combined to generate in silico bulk bronchial brushings . Analysis of differential expression between never and current smoker in silico bulk samples revealed associations that were highly correlated ( Spearman 's r = 0.45 ) with those observed in a previously published bulk bronchial brushing dataset generated by microarray ( fig . S4 ) ( 18 ) . <p> Fig. 1scRNA-Seq of human bronchial cells from never and current smokers . <p> ( A ) Bronchial brushings were procured from the right mainstem bronchus of six never smokers and six current smokers . Bronchial tissue was dissociated , single cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting ( FACS ) , and single-cell RNA libraries were prepared and sequenced . ( B ) t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ( t-SNE ) was performed to illustrate transcriptomic relationships among cells . Donor smoking status ( NS , never smoker ; CS , current smoker ) was visualized for each cell as well as expression of bronchial cell type marker genes z-normalized transcripts per million ( TPM ) values across all cells : KRT5 ( basal ) , FOXJ1 ( ciliated ) , SCGB1A1 ( club ) , MUC5AC ( goblet ) , and CD45 ( WBC ) . ( C ) An unsupervised analytical approach ( LDA ) was used to identify distinct cell clusters and sets of coexpressed genes . Cell clusters were defined by unique gene set expression patterns , and never or current smoker cell enrichment was assessed . <p> To characterize cellular subpopulations beyond known cell type markers , we used latent Dirichlet allocation ( LDA ) as an unsupervised framework to assign cells to clusters and identify distinct sets of coexpressed genes across all cells ( Fig. 1C ) . LDA divided the dataset into 13 distinct cell clusters and 19 sets of coexpressed genes ( Fig. 2 , A and B , and figs . S5 to S8 ) . Each cell cluster was defined by the expression of a unique combination of gene sets , and each gene set was defined by a unique expression pattern among clusters ( Fig. 2 , A and B , and fig . S9 ) . Cell types were defined for 8 of the 13 clusters based on medium to high marker gene expression : Cell clusters C-2 and C-4 expressed KRT5 , C-5 and C-11 expressed FOXJ1 , C-1 and C-8 expressed SCGB1A1 , and C-3 expressed MUC5AC ( Fig. 2C ) . Cluster C-7 expressed WBC marker CD45 ( Fig. 2C ) , and Fisher 's exact test was used to show that C-7 was enriched with sorted CD45+ cells ( P = 9.6 ? 10-47 , Fisher 's exact test ) . C-7 cells also expressed several T cell receptor genes ( e.g. , TRBC2 and TRGC1 ) , indicating a T cell lineage ( fig . S10 ) . Low levels of SCGB1A1 transcripts were detected in cluster C-10 ( SCGB1A1low ) , and CFTR was expressed by cluster C-13 , which suggests that these cells may be ionocytes ( fig . S11 ) ( 21 ) . Marker gene expression was not detected in clusters C-6 , C-9 , and C-12 ( Fig. 2C ) . Enrichment false discovery rate ( FDR ) q &lt; 0.05 of current smoker cells was observed in goblet cell cluster C-3 , as well as C-9 and C-12 , whereas that of never smoker cells was observed in club cell cluster C-1 and basal cluster C-4 ( Fig. 2D ) . Donor-specific contributions of cells to each cluster were variable ; however , most of the never and current smokers contributed to each never and current smoker -- associated cell cluster , respectively ( fig . S12 ) . Furthermore , a subset of gene sets expressed by specific clusters of ciliated , club , goblet , and basal cells , as well as those without a cell type designation , was differentially expressed between never and current smokers in transcriptomic data generated from bulk bronchial tissue ( Fig. 2 , A and B , and fig . S13 ) ( 18 ) . Therefore , smoking-induced gene expression changes reported in bulk tissue are likely driven by alterations to multiple bronchial cell types . <p> ( A ) Global transcriptomic profiles of 13 bronchial cell clusters were defined by expression of unique combinations of 19 gene sets and visualized by heatmap ( z-normalized TPM values ) . ( B ) A MetaGene was generated for each gene set ( GS-1 to GS-19 ) , and mean cluster-specific expression was designated : high ( pink ) , medium ( white ) , low ( light gray ) , or not expressed ( dark gray ) . ( C ) Mean expression of marker genes was summarized for each cluster designated : high ( pink ) , medium ( white ) , low ( light gray ) , or not expressed ( dark gray ) . ( D ) Per-cluster percentage of total cells and the ratio of never and current smoker cells were calculated , and per-cluster statistical enrichment ( FDR q &lt; 0.05 , indicated in blue ) of NS or CS cells was assessed . <h> Ciliated cell subpopulations and smoking-induced detoxification <p> We characterized transcriptomic similarities and differences among FOXJ1+ clusters C-5 and C-11 to define ciliated cell subpopulations detected in never and current smokers . Our data revealed that both clusters of ciliated cells expressed gene set GS-2 but could be differentiated based on expression of gene set GS-3 by cluster C-5 and gene set GS-7 by cluster C-11 ( Fig. 3A ) . GS-2 contains FOXJ1 , in addition to genes involved with ciliary assembly , maintenance , and function , such as motor protein genes ( e.g. , DYNLL1 and DNAH9 ) and intraflagellar transport genes ( e.g. , IFT57 and IFT172 ) ( Fig. 3A and extended table S3 ) . GS-2 also includes antioxidant genes ( e.g. , PRDX5 , GPX4 , and GSTA2 ) , known transcriptional regulators of ciliogenesis e.g. , RFX2 ( 22 , 23 ) and RFX3 ( 24 , 25 ) , and surface proteins not previously attributed to ciliated cells ( e.g. , CDHR3 and CD59 ) . GS-3 contains genes with known roles in airway ciliary biology , such as IFT88 ( required for ciliary formation ) ( 26 -- 28 ) and DNAH5 ( required for ciliary motility ) ( 29 -- 31 ) . By contrast , gene set GS-7 is enriched with cell cycle -- associated genes ( extended table S3 ) , such as CDK1 and CCNB1 ( G1-S transition ) and TOP2A ( S-phase DNA replication ) , as well as the transcription factor HES6 . Therefore , clusters C-5 and C-11 likely represent functionally distinct subpopulations of FOXJ1+ ciliated cells . <p> Fig. 3A smoking-induced detoxification program was observed in ciliated cells . <p> ( A ) Expression of gene sets GS-2 , GS-3 , and GS-7 in clusters C-5 and C-11 was visualized by heatmap ( z-normalized TPM values ) . ( B ) Cluster C-5 was split into never and current smoker subsets , and expression of GS-8 genes was visualized by heatmap . ( C ) Bronchial tissue procured from an independent cohort of never and current smokers ( UMCG cohort , table S2 ) was immunostained for AKR1B10 , Ac-a-Tub , and KRT8 . Representative images of never smoker ( left ) and current smoker ( right ) tissue were displayed . Arrows specify examples of AKR1B10+ ciliated cells ( Ac-a-Tub+ ) . ( D ) An increase in tissue length ( ? m ) -- normalized numbers of AKR1B10+ Ac-a-Tub+ cells was observed in current smokers relative to never smokers P = 7.4 ? 10-7 , Wilcoxon rank-sum ( WRS ) test . <p> We found that ciliated cells from current smokers expressed a distinct transcriptional signature . Specifically , the current smoker subset of cluster C-5 FOXJ1+ cells expressed gene set GS-8 , which was enriched with genes encoding enzymes implicated in aldehyde and ketone metabolism , such as ALDH3A1 , AKR1C1 , and AKR1B10 ( Fig. 3B ) . This finding suggested that the gene expression response to toxic aldehydes and ketones present in tobacco smoke ( 8 , 9 ) might be restricted to ciliated epithelial cells . To confirm that this set of enzymes localized to ciliated cells , we immunostained bronchial tissue procured from an independent cohort of never and current smokers University Medical Center Groningen ( UMCG ) cohort , table S2 for the aldo-keto reductase AKR1B10 , as well as cilia-specific acetylated a-tubulin ( Ac-a-Tub ) and the luminal cytokeratin KRT8 , which is expressed by all nonbasal cells ( Fig. 3C ) . We found that AKR1B10 was robustly expressed in the airways of current smokers , and numbers of AKR1B10+ ciliated cells were significantly higher than those observed in never smokers ( P = 7.4 ? 10-7 ; Fig. 3 , C and D ) . AKR1B10 was detected throughout the cytoplasm of smoker ciliated cells , as well as at the base of the cilia ( Fig. 3C ) . AKR1B10+ ciliated cells were uncommon in never smokers , and overall low magnitude of AKR1B10 expression was observed in these cells ( Fig. 3C ) . We detected rare instances of nonciliated AKR1B10+ KRT8+ cells ( fig . S14A ) , but AKR1B10+ KRT8- cells were not observed . We also confirmed that AKR1B10 was not expressed by current smoker MUC5AC+ goblet cells ( fig . S14B ) . Overall , these results demonstrate that ciliated cells express a specific set of detoxification genes in response to smoke exposure . <h> Club cell depletion and goblet cell expansion in the airways of smokers <p> Our data revealed that the largest cluster of SCGB1A1+ cells , C-1 , was enriched with never smoker cells ( Fig. 2D ) , indicating that this subpopulation of club cells was depleted from the airways of smokers . C-1 cells distinctly expressed high levels of gene set GS-19 , which contains MUC5B , in addition to SCGB3A1 and transcription factors TCF7 , FOS , and JUN ( Fig. 4A ) . However , SCGB1A1 ( included in gene set GS-17 ) was also highly expressed by cluster C-8 , which was not affected by smoking status ( Fig. 2D ) . Therefore , these results indicate that smoking is associated with a decrease in MUC5B+ SCGB1A1+ ( C-1 ) club cell content . Furthermore , gene set GS-13 , which contains immunologically relevant genes BPIFB1 ( 32 ) and PIGR ( 33 ) ( Fig. 4A ) , was expressed by SCGB1A1+ cells ( C-1 and C-8 ) as well as MUC5AC+ cluster C-3 , indicating that there may be functional overlap among club and goblet cells . <p> The MUC5AC+ goblet cell cluster C-3 was significantly enriched with current smoker cells ( Fig. 2D ) , which is consistent with previous studies showing that smoking is associated with increased bronchial goblet cell abundance ( 12 -- 14 ) . Cluster C-3 expressed gene set GS-1 , which contains the goblet cell marker gene MUC5AC as well as several genes with known roles in goblet cell biology , such as SPDEF ( 34 ) , AGR2 ( 35 ) , and TFF3 ( 36 ) ( Fig. 4A ) . Genes associated with the unfolded protein response are present in GS-1 ( e.g. , KDLER3 and DNAJC10 ) ( extended table S3 ) . We also identified several unique goblet cell surface markers ( e.g. , CLDN10 , TSPAN8 , and TSPAN13 ) , as well as a transcription factor ( NKX3-1 ) whose role in the goblet cell transcriptional program is unknown ( Fig. 4A ) . Therefore , these data indicate that smoking is associated with increased numbers of MUC5AC+ goblet cells . <p> To confirm smoking-associated shifts in club and goblet cell numbers , we immunostained bronchial tissue procured from an independent cohort of never and current smokers ( UMCG cohort , table S2 ) for markers of club ( MUC5B ) and goblet ( MUC5AC ) cells ( Fig. 4B ) . Imaging data revealed cell subpopulations that exclusively express MUC5B or MUC5AC , as well as those that coexpress both MUC5B and MUC5AC ( Fig. 4B ) . The airways of never smokers contained similar numbers of MUC5B+ , MUC5B+ , MUC5AC+ , and MUC5AC+ cells ( Fig. 4 , B and F ) . The bronchial epithelium of current smokers , however , took on two distinct phenotypes : tissue regions described as "" morphologically normal "" ( MN ) , which were similar to never smokers , and regions characterized by high MUC5AC+ cell density , referred to as goblet cell hyperplasia ( GCH ) ( Fig. 4B and fig . S15 ) . In the MN smoker tissue , we observed a significant decrease in MUC5B+ cells ( P = 0.02 ) ( Fig. 4C ) and a significant increase in MUC5AC+ cells ( P = 1.5 ? 10-6 ) ( Fig. 4E ) , relative to never smokers , but no change in MUC5B+ MUC5AC+ content was observed ( Fig. 4D ) . Differences between smoker GCH and never smoker epithelium , however , were more pronounced . Near-complete loss of MUC5B+ cells was observed in smoker GCH ( P = 1.8 ? 10-5 ; Fig. 4C ) , along with a significant loss of MUC5B+ MUC5AC+ cells ( P = 0.02 ; Fig. 4D ) , relative to never smokers . GCH-associated alterations were accompanied by a 13-fold increase in MUC5AC+ cells ( P = 7.4 ? 10-7 ; Fig. 4 , E and F ) . Additional immunostaining for KRT5 expression in the same bronchial tissue revealed that basal cell content was not affected by smoking status and did not vary between MN and GCH regions ( fig . S16 ) . Overall , these findings indicate that smoking is associated with a loss of club cells , increased numbers of goblet cells , and substantial GCH airway remodeling . <p> We sought to establish the identity of cluster C-9 , which was strongly enriched with current smoker cells and did not express established cell type marker genes ( e.g. , KRT5 , FOXJ1 , SCGB1A1 , and MUC5AC ) ( Fig. 2C ) . C-9 cells expressed high levels of gene set GS-12 , which contains the luminal cytokeratin KRT8 ( Fig. 5A ) . Additional cytokeratin genes were also present in GS-12 , such as KRT13 and KRT19 , as well as antioxidant genes , such as TXN and GPX1 ( Fig. 5A ) . Cluster C-9 also expressed gene set GS-16 , which was detected at low levels in MUC5AC+ cells ( C-3 ) and contained the xenobiotic metabolism gene CYP1B1 ( Fig. 5A ) . Furthermore , high expression of gene set GS-15 was detected in both C-9 and MUC5AC+ cells ( C-3 ) ( Fig. 5 , A to C ) , suggesting that this cluster may have a functional relationship with goblet cells . GS-15 contains several genes previously reported to be persistently up-regulated after smoking cessation ( e.g. , CEACAM5 , CEACAM6 , and UPK1B ) ( 18 ) , one of which has been explicitly linked to lung squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) and premalignancy ( CEACAM5 ) ( 37 ) . <p> Fig. 5A previously unidentified subpopulation of PG cells was observed in the airways of smokers . <p> ( A ) Expression of gene sets GS-12 , GS-16 , GS-15 , and MUC5AC in clusters C-3 and C-9 was visualized by heatmap ( z-normalized TPM values ) . ( B ) t-SNE was used to visualize cluster C-3 and C-9 cells as well as ( C ) CEACAM5 expression ( z-normalized TPM values ) across all cells . ( D ) Bronchial tissue procured from an independent cohort of never and current smokers ( UCL cohort , table S3 ) was immunostained for CEACAM5 , KRT8 , and MUC5AC . Representative images of never smoker tissue and current smoker GCH were displayed . Arrows specify examples of CEACAM5+ KRT8+ MUC5AC- PG cells . ( E ) A significant increase in tissue length ( ? m ) -- normalized numbers of CEACAM5+ KRT8+ MUC5AC- cells in current smoker GCH tissue , relative to never smokers , was observed ( P = 0.004 , WRS test ) . <p> To validate the presence of cluster C-9 cells in the airways of current smokers , we immunostained bronchial tissue procured from a second independent cohort of never and current smokers University College London ( UCL ) cohort , table S3 for KRT8 , MUC5AC ( goblet cells ) , and Ac-a-Tub ( ciliated cells ) . KRT8+ MUC5AC- Ac-a-Tub- cells that were morphologically distinct from goblet and ciliated cells were detected in significantly higher numbers in GCH regions of current smokers relative to never smokers ( fig . S17 ) . To confirm that there was functional overlap between goblet cells and this subpopulation of KRT8+ MUC5AC- Ac-a-Tub- cells , we immunostained bronchial tissue ( UCL cohort , table S3 ) for CEACAM5 , in addition to KRT8 and MUC5AC . Increased numbers of CEACAM5+ KRT8+ MUC5AC- cells were detected in GCH regions of current smokers relative to never smokers ( P = 0.004 ) ( Fig. 5 , D and E ) , although variable content among donors was observed . Within current smoker GCH tissue regions , CEACAM5+ KRT8+ MUC5AC- cells were typically found in close proximity to goblet cells ( CEACAM5+ KRT8+ MUC5AC+ ) and were therefore named peri-goblet ( PG ) cells ( UCL cohort , Fig. 5D ; UMCG cohort , fig . S18 ) . CEACAM5 expression in goblet cells was phenotypically punctate and colocalized with MUC5AC in both never and current smokers ( Fig. 5D and fig . S18 ) . In PG cells , however , CEACAM5 localized to the plasma membrane and cytoplasm ( Fig. 5D and fig . S18 ) . Overall , these data indicate that PG cells are a previously unidentified , bronchial epithelial subpopulation associated with smoking-induced GCH . <h> DISCUSSION <p> Previous transcriptomic studies have shown that smoking is associated with a robust bronchial gene expression signature ( 17 , 18 ) . Interrogation of bronchial tissue at single-cell resolution revealed that elements of this signature were derived from different cell subpopulations . Overall , we found smoking-associated phenotypes that included a metabolic response that localized to ciliated cells , a cell type shift that involved club cell loss and goblet cell expansion , and a previously uncharacterized subpopulation of PG epithelial cells present within regions of GCH ( fig . S19 ) . <p> We identified a gene set ( GS-8 ) specifically expressed by smoker ciliated cells ( C-5 ) that contains genes encoding families of enzymes , such as aldehyde dehydrogenases ( e.g. , ALDH3A1 and ALDH1A3 ) and aldo-keto reductases ( e.g. , AKR1B10 and AKR1C1 ) , capable of breaking down tobacco smoke -- derived chemical compounds , such as toxic aldehydes ( e.g. , formaldehyde and acrolein ) and ketones ( e.g. , acetone and methyl vinyl ketone ) ( 8 , 9 ) . This finding suggests that ciliated cells exhibit a cell type -- specific coping mechanism that may convey resistance to certain forms of smoking-induced toxicity . Links between this mechanism and previously reported smoking phenotypes , such as reduced ciliary length ( 15 ) , however , are unclear . This finding might also highlight a protective function with tissue-wide significance , in which the bronchial epithelium 's capacity for detoxification may be compromised if ciliated cells are lost because of injury or disease . <p> Several studies have reported that smoking is associated with increased mucous production and GCH in the bronchus ( 12 -- 14 , 38 -- 40 ) . Loss of club cells ( SCGB1A1+ ) has been reported in smoker bronchioles ( 11 , 12 ) , but this is the first instance in which a similar observation has been made in the mainstem bronchus . We confirmed that GCH is a regional phenomenon interspersed among MN tissue areas . The determinants of GCH prevalence are unclear , but it has been shown that cytokines e.g. , interleukin-13 ( IL-13 ) and ( IL-4 ) ( 41 -- 43 ) and viral infection ( e.g. , Rhino virus and **26;3569;TOOLONG acid ) ( 44 , 45 ) can increase MUC5AC expression and goblet cell abundance . The specific catalyst for GCH in response to smoke exposure is unknown , but reports of its co-occurrence with airway inflammation suggest that immunological interplay may be a factor ( 14 ) . Furthermore , there is evidence that both basal and club cells are capable of goblet cell differentiation ( 32 , 46 ) . However , the origins of newly formed goblet cells in the airways of smokers have not been explicitly described . Functional implications for goblet cell expansion and club cell loss are unclear , but a similar phenotype has been described in the airways of asthmatics , in which diminished mucosal fluidity , the formation of mucosal plugs , and impaired mucociliary clearance were observed ( 47 , 48 ) . Murine models have also shown that MUC5B loss is associated with impaired mucociliary clearance , airflow obstruction , and respiratory infection ( 49 ) . <p> Smoking-induced GCH was associated with the presence of a previously uncharacterized subpopulation of CEACAM5+ KRT8+ MUC5AC- PG epithelial cells . The origins of PG cells are unclear , but a KRT8+ undifferentiated epithelial subpopulation derived from basal cells , referred to as "" suprabasal , "" has been described in murine models ( 46 , 50 ) . Suprabasal cells act as intermediate precursors to ciliated and secretory cells during basal cell differentiation under normal conditions ( 46 ) and , after injury , as a repair mechanism ( 50 ) . However , the suprabasal phenomenon has not been characterized in the human bronchus , and little is known regarding human intermediate epithelial subpopulations . Furthermore , the involvement of a KRT8+ intermediate state in club cell transdifferentiation ( 4 , 34 ) has not been explored . Goblet cell differentiation required for the onset and maintenance of smoking-associated GCH might involve a pro-goblet precursor subpopulation , but the explicit role of PG cells in this context requires further investigation . <p> It has been reported that CEACAM5 expression is persistently up-regulated in the airways of former smokers , whereas genes specifically expressed by goblet cells , such as MUC5AC , SPDEF , and AGR2 , return to normal , never smoker levels post-smoking cessation ( 18 ) . These findings suggest that goblet cell expansion in the airways of smokers is reversible , whereas the emergence of CEACAM5+ PG cells might have long-term implications . The functional consequences of the presence of PG cells are unclear , but irreversible alterations to bronchial epithelial composition might underlie chronic disease states . Although PG cells were identified in this study in the absence of established disease phenotypes , CEACAM5+ KRT5+ cells have been detected in bronchial premalignant lesions and lung SCC ( 37 ) . CEACAM5 has also been detected in numerous additional cancer types ( 51 , 52 ) , and several genes that are coexpressed with CEACAM5 ( i.e. , detected in GS-15 ) have been implicated in carcinogenesis , such as UPK1B ( 53 ) , MSLN ( 54 , 55 ) , and PSCA ( 56 , 57 ) . Therefore , investigation of mechanisms linking the presence and variable abundance of GCH-associated CEACAM5+ PG cells and premalignant lesion-associated CEACAM5+ KRT5+ cells might provide insight into smoking-induced conditions that promote lung carcinogenesis . <p> These data demonstrate that human bronchial epithelial exposure to tobacco smoke drives ciliated cell -- specific toxin metabolism and leads to both club cell depletion and goblet cell expansion . A novel subpopulation of PG cells was also detected in the bronchial airways of smokers in association with GCH . These results will enable us to more precisely define the landscape of smoking-induced epithelial abnormalities . Future work will use experimental systems to define the consequences of specific , smoke-derived chemical compounds and investigate the recapitulation and reversal of cell and molecular phenotypes observed in this study . Furthermore , these findings may be leveraged to improve diagnostics and develop preventative strategies for smoking-associated lung diseases . <h> MATERIALS AND METHODS <h> Bronchial tissue collection for scRNA-Seq <p> At Boston University Medical Center , healthy volunteer never smokers ( n = 6 ) and current smokers ( n = 6 ) underwent a bronchoscopy to obtain brushings from the right mainstem bronchus , as described previously ( 17 , 18 ) . Eligible volunteers included subjects who ( i ) were between the ages of 19 and 55 ; ( ii ) did not use inhaled or intranasal medications ; ( iii ) did not have a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , asthma , pulmonary fibrosis , sarcoid , or head and neck/lung cancer ; ( iv ) did not use marijuana ; ( v ) did not have a respiratory infection within the past 6 weeks ; and ( vi ) did not use other tobacco products ( i.e. , pipe , cigar , and chewing ) . Spirometry was performed to assess lung function ( e.g. , FEV1/FVC ) . Exhaled carbon monoxide ( Smokerlyzer Carbon Monoxide Monitor , model EC-50 ; Bedfont Scientific Ltd. ) and urine cotinine ( NicAlert ; Confirm BioSciences ) levels were measured to confirm smoking status . The Institutional Review Board approved the study , and all subjects provided written informed consent . <h> Data preprocessing <p> Illumina 's bcl2fastq2 software ( v2.19.1 ) was used to demultiplex the sequencing output to 12 plate-level FASTQ files ( 1 per 96-well plate ) . A python-based pipeline ( https : **38;3597;TOOLONG ... was used to ( i ) demultiplex each plate-level FASTQ file to 96 cell-level FASTQ files , trim 52 nucleotide reads to 35 nucleotides , and append UMI information from read 1 ( R1 ) to the header of read 2 ( R2 ) ; ( ii ) perform genomic alignment of R2 with Bowtie2 ( v2.2.2 ) using a concatenated hg19/External RNA Controls Consortium ( ERCC ) reference assembly ; and ( iii ) convert aligned reads to gene-level counts using a modified version of the HTSeq ( v0.5.4p1 ) python library that identifies reads aligning to the same location with identical UMIs and reduces them to a single count . One UMI-corrected count was then referred to as a "" transcript . "" The pipeline was configured with the following settings : alignment quality ( minbcquality ) = 10 , barcode length ( bclength ) = 6 , UMI length ( umilength ) = 5 , cutlength = 35 . <h> Data quality control <p> The quality of each cell was assessed by examining the total number of reads , total reads aligned to hg19 , total reads aligning to genes ( pre-UMI correction ) , total transcript counts , and total genes with at least one detected transcript . Cells were excluded from downstream analyses if the total number of transcripts was not twofold greater than the total background-level transcripts detected in the empty well negative control on each plate ( fig . S3 ) . Cells were also excluded from downstream analyses if there was a weak Pearson correlation ( r &lt; 0.7 ) between detected ERCC RNA Spike-In transcript counts ( log10 ) and ERCC input concentration ( log10 ) ( amol/ml ) ( fig . S3 ) . All non -- protein-coding genes and genes with less than two transcript counts in five cells were removed from the dataset . The remaining 7680 genes measured across 796 cells were used for subsequent analyses . <h> LDA implementation and model optimization <p> LDA from the topicmodels R package ( v0.2-6 ) was used to generate probabilistic representations of cell clusters and gene sets present in the dataset , referred to as Cell-States and Gene-States . The input for the Cell-State model required a counts data matrix where cells were columns and genes were rows , whereas for the Gene-State model , the same matrix was transposed ( i.e. , genes were columns and cells were rows ) . Models were fit using the variational expectation -- maximization ( VEM ) algorithm with the following parameters : nstart = 5 , seed = 12345 , estimate.alpha = TRUE , estimate.beta = TRUE . The given parameter k determined the number of Cell-States and Gene-States to be estimated by the model . The optimal value of k was determined by fivefold cross-validation and evaluation of model perplexity . For the Gene-State model , cells were randomly partitioned into "" training "" ( 80% ) and "" test "" ( 20% ) sets , whereas for the Cell-State model , genes were randomly partitioned into training ( 80% ) and test ( 20% ) sets . Models were then fit to the training set , and perplexity was estimated to evaluate model fit for the held-out test set . Fifty iterations of this process were performed for k = 2 to 50 , mean perplexity was calculated at each k , and the minimum mean perplexity was selected as the optimal value of k ( i.e. , k.opt ) , which was k = 13 for the Cell-State model and k = 19 for the Gene-State model ( fig . S6 ) . <h> Gene set and cell cluster assignments <p> Negative binomial generalized linear models were built using the MASS R package ( v7.3-45 ) for each Gene-State ( n = 19 ) and each Cell-State ( n = 13 ) , in which States were treated as inferred , independent variables and genes or cells , respect"

Imagine your disappointment if you learned that the only information the salesperson can give you is the number of seats in each vehicle . <p> How crazy would that be ? Of course , to make sure a car fits your requirements , you need a lot more information . <p> What color is the car ? Does it have the right accessories ? And , what kind of gas mileage does it get ? Ultimately , you would also like to know how it performs under different conditions , like driving in town and on the highway . Only when armed with more information could you make an informed decision about buying a car or making a comparison between different vehicles . <p> Until now , that 's pretty much how we have evaluated quantum computers . The focus has mainly been on the number of qubits in a quantum computer while ignoring many other important factors affecting its computational ability . <p> Before Google announced it had achieved Quantum Supremacy , the media speculated on how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ignoring the controversial technical aspects of Google 's accomplishment , it finally achieved the benchmark . Of course , most articles focused on the fact that Google used a 54-qubit quantum processor . <p> What 's next after quantum supremacy ? <p> Beyond quantum supremacy , the next major benchmark , called quantum advantage , is on the distant horizon . Quantum advantage will exist when programmable NISQ quantum gate-based or circuit-based computers reach a degree of technical maturity that allows them to solve many , but not necessarily all , significant real-world problems that classical computers ca n't solve , or problems that classical machines require an exponential amount of time to solve . <p> World-changing applications will be possible once we reach quantum advantage . The major applications will likely include optimization , chemistry , machine learning , and organic simulations . <p> From Quantum Supremacy to Quantum Advantage <p> Although the number of qubits is essential , so are the number of operations completed before qubits lose their quantum states . Qubits decohere either due to noise or because of their inherent properties . For those reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex problems is not just a simple matter of increasing the number of qubits . <p> Before we can move from a hundred qubits to one with thousands of qubits , and eventual to one with millions of qubits , many significant technical issues remain to be solved . Moreover , none of the problems have overnight solutions . It will likely take another five or ten years of incremental research , experimentation , and steady technical improvements to find answers . <p> Configuration changes - subtle and significant -- can dramatically affect the performance of a quantum computer . Determining the optimum quantum computer configuration is much like solving a Rubik 's Cube . In the process of trying to align all the blue tiles on one surface , the previously solved red surface becomes disrupted . <p> The power of Quantum Volume <p> It would be helpful if quantum researchers had a tool that allowed them to systematically measure and understand how incremental technology , configuration and design changes affected a quantum computer 's overall power and performance . Corporate users also need a way to compare the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quantum volume factors <p> IBM <p> IBM foresaw the need for such a metric in 2017 when its researchers developed a full-system performance measurement called Quantum Volume . <p> Quantum Volume 's numerical value indicates the relative complexity of a problem that can be solved by the quantum computer . The number of qubits and the number of operations that can be performed are called the width and depth of a quantum circuit . The deeper the circuit , the more complex of an algorithm the computer can run . Circuit depth is influenced by such things as the number of qubits , how qubits are interconnected , gate and measurement errors , device cross talk , circuit compiler efficiency , and more . <p> That 's where Quantum Volume comes in . It analyzes the collective performance and efficiency of these factors then produces a single , easy-to-understand Quantum Volume number . The larger the number , the more powerful the quantum computer . <p> Demonstrated incremental improvements <p> Quantum Volume can be used to compare the power of one quantum computer to another . It can also play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create bigger and better quantum computers to achieve a quantum advantage . <p> IBM Quantum Volume Growth <p> IBM <p> IBM tested Quantum Volume on three of its quantum computers . The test included the following : the Tenerife five-qubit computer released through the IBM Q Experience quantum cloud service in 2017 , the 20-qubit Tokyo 2018 computer , and the 20-qubit 2019 IBM Q System One . <p> Jay Gambetta , IBM Vice President , Quantum Computing , posted graphs online showing progressive improvement in CNOT error rates as a result of various changes . In the post , he said : "" With four revisions of our 20-qubit quantum system ( chip name "" Penguin "" ) plotted together , you can really see the progress in stability , scalability , and reduction of errors over the last two years . "" <p> When asked for more detail on how Quantum Volume assisted in these improvements , the IBM research team said : "" These plots are a great example of why qubit counts alone do not tell the whole story . Over several revisions of the architecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown in the plots ; and that has a significant impact on improving quantum volume from revision to revision . There are many other performance metrics and architectural choices that impact the quantum volume of a system as well - for instance how the qubits are laid out and connected to one another . Maximizing quantum volume is about making trade-offs between these different parameters - and identifying new ways to push those boundaries . This is why the quantum volume metric is so important ; otherwise it would be quite possible to drive a couple of parameters to report on publicly yet to the detriment of overall quantum volume as it can be measured in a single system . "" <p> Optimizing with Quantum Volume <p> For the foreseeable future , quantum computers will use noisy qubits with relatively high error rates and short coherence times .

"" <p> Quantum Volume and the quantum computing ecosystem <p> Most of today 's benchmarking is done at the component level for qubits and quantum logic gates .

We address this question by introducing a single-number metric , the quantum volume , together with a concrete protocol for measuring it on near-term systems .

Utah 's rate in 2017 was 22.7 per 100,000 population , compared with 14 nationally . <p> Three years ago , Liu and a classmate , Mia Yu , produced a suicide prevention poster as a middle school science project , using machine learning techniques to analyze Utah 's opioid overdose data . <p> Dr. Paul Nestadt , a researcher at Johns Hopkins in Maryland , said Thursday a colleague alerted him to the poster , which won a national competition .

"" It feels good having generated knowledge for the world and that people are learning from me . "" <p> Nestadt said Utah has the nation 's second highest rate of overdose deaths that were left unclassified by medical examiners -- neither accidental or intentional . <p> The researchers concluded the machine learning process employed by Liu can be cost-effectively replicated and expanded "" to estimate the true rates of suicide which may be partially masked during the opioid epidemic .

But with the research findings , 229 cases were added to the suicide total . <p> Therefore , overdose suicides were underreported by 9.2% , according to the researchers . <p> "" For suicide or accidental overdose prevention efforts to be successfully evaluated , epidemiological data , including true prevalence and risk profiles , must be reliable and accurate , "" the report said . <p> Nestadt said that while the opioid overdose epidemic "" does n't show any signs of stopping , "" the new data will help lead to better suicide prevention . <p> This Feb. 19 , 2013 , file photo shows OxyContin pills arranged for a photo at a pharmacy in Montpelier , Vt . <p> "" The takeaway for primary care physicians , I want them to be extra careful about suicide risks "" when they are dealing with patients experiencing symptoms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opioid pills at a time , informing the patient 's loved ones , he said , and even employing those relatives to parcel out the medications . <p> "" If everyone 's got Vicodin in their medicine cabinet it could be like having a loaded gun in their house , "" Nestadt said . <p> Nestadt praised Utah for having a "" world class "" suicide prevention system and top flight medical examiners .

"<h> How Facebook can cut down on fake news without relying on thousands of humans to decide what is true <h> Written by <h> Obsession <h> Share <h> Written by <h> Obsession <p> The world 's most powerful news provider has a fake news problem -- and it does n't appear to know what to do about it . <p> After Donald Trump secured an unexpected victory in the US presidential election , Facebook 's role in enabling his campaign has come under the spotlight . Not only did the social network create an "" echo chamber "" where users only see information that reinforces their existing biases , it also disseminated information that was patently false , and which often aided Trump . Content creators looking for easy clicks and ad revenue gamed the system , publishing fake but viral stories like "" Pope Francis Forbids Catholics From Voting For Hillary ! "" which were shared hundreds of thousands of times on Facebook . <p> Now the company seems divided internally about its next steps . Zuckerberg issued a statement alleging that "" more than 99% of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees disagree .

The company had created tools to deal with the problem earlier this year , then deliberately did not deploy them , Gizmodo reports , fearing the reaction from conservative outlets which were disproportionately targeted ( because they had more fake news ) . <p> On Monday ( Nov. 14 ) the company did make one major change , banning fake news publishers from its ad network . But it has n't introduced new measures to prevent what they publish from appearing on your Facebook News Feed . While this means these companies may make less money from Facebook , users remain concerned by what shows up in News Feed , not outside of it , the ban may do little to address their grievances . <p> Zuckerberg framed the issue on Nov. 13 as a problem with truth itself , which is n't always clear cut , and suggests an influential private company deciding for readers what is true and what is false risks going down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated . While some hoaxes can be completely debunked , a greater amount of content , including from mainstream sources , often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted . An even greater volume of stories express an opinion that many will disagree with and flag as incorrect even when factual . I am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful , but I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves . <p> For Facebook , employing a team of human editors to vet for the "" truth "" might not only be unfeasible given the amount of information it handles , but also undesirable after the company 's Trending News debacle .

As an obligate blood feeding mite , the northern fowl mite can cause anaemia , slower growth , and decreased egg production of parasitized birds . However , the impact of mites or other ectoparasites on hen behaviour or welfare is not well studied . Here , we use activity sensors ( three-axis accelerometers ) affixed to individual birds to continuously record hen movement before , during , and after infestation with mites . Movements recorded by sensors were identified to specific bird behaviours through a previously trained algorithm , with frequency of these behaviours recorded for individual birds . Hen welfare was also determined before , during , and after mite infestation of hens using animal-based welfare metrics . Northern fowl mites significantly increased hen preening behaviour and resulted in increased skin lesions of infested birds . <h> Introduction <p> Commercial poultry production in the United States is rapidly changing largely due to public concerns about animal welfare . Until recently , ca. 95% of egg layers in this country were housed in wire cages suspended off the ground1 , but the industry is rapidly shifting toward cage-free housing for egg production2 , and it is predicted that over the next decade at least 40% of birds will be housed in cage-free alternative housing systems3 . One aspect driving consumer demand of cage-free eggs is the perceived increase in the health and welfare of poultry housed in cage-free systems . However , animal welfare encompasses many aspects of animal health and behaviour , which can be complex and difficult to optimize1,4 . For example , while cage-free housing might provide birds greater freedom of movement throughout a poultry house , birds may also have increased exposure to ectoparasites through contact with the ground , other individuals , or with wild birds . <p> The most common and damaging ectoparasite ( external parasite ) of commercial poultry in the United States is the northern fowl mite ( NFM ; Ornithonyssus sylviarum Canestrini &amp; Fanzango ; reviewed in5 ) . NFM are permanent ectoparasites that complete their entire life cycle on-host and can infest chickens regardless of housing type6,7 . NFM require blood meals to complete their life cycle and to reproduce . Birds heavily infested with NFM can suffer up to 6% blood loss per day8 . Through their feeding , mites induce skin inflammation , irritation , anaemia , and even death as a result of **27;1211;TOOLONG . Mite-infested birds exhibit decreased egg production and reduced feed conversion efficiency12,14 . Infestation with mites or other ectoparasites can also contribute to animal discomfort and pain/injury , which may also hinder birds from fulfilling "" normal "" behaviours . Despite these obvious negative effects to bird health caused by NFM , they are largely ignored in current animal welfare assessments . In the widely adopted Welfare Quality15 assessment protocol , only presence or absence of ectoparasites is noted ; there is no qualitative or quantitative evaluation of ectoparasite infestation level or impacts to birds . Even the species of ectoparasite infesting an animal is not recorded , though impacts to animal health and production would be expected to vary by parasite species12,13,16 . In addition to differential impact by parasite species , the degree of impact will also vary based on severity of infestation , previous exposure to ectoparasites , and other factors . Linking degree of ectoparasite infestation to welfare metrics is a knowledge gap to optimizing high standards of animal welfare in poultry production . <p> Few studies have examined the effect of NFM on the behaviour of chickens , and these studies were limited to caged birds17,18 . The time investment for traditional behavioural studies ( using video-recording or by direct observation ) severely limits the number of animals that can be examined as well as the observation period for each animal . In addition , it can be difficult to elucidate chicken behaviours associated with illness or disease as sick birds are more prone to hiding and thus are not as readily observed19 . <p> The use of new technologies , such as on-animal activity sensors , can increase behavioural observations in time and space without the risk of human bias or human interference with animal behaviours ( reviewed in20 ) . On-animal sensors can also increase the number of individual animals tracked , while increasing the tracking period and the sensitivity for detection of behaviours . The increased data that can be obtained using on-animal sensors provides greater statistical power than can typically be achieved in direct observation studies . On-animal sensors are versatile and can be used to measure duration and type of animal movement , individual animal location , and/or body temperature . <p> Ectoparasite effects on the health and welfare of poultry in cage-free systems have not been evaluated but are important to understand as poultry husbandry practices continue to shift toward cage-free housing , which is expected to increase the diversity of ectoparasites associated with these birds21 . In the present study , we use on-animal sensors coupled with visual assessment of animal health to evaluate chicken behaviours and welfare metrics in the absence of mites , at low and high mite scores , following mite control , and after a secondary mite infestation . <h> Methods <h> Chickens <p> Forty-eight beak trimmed Hy-Line Brown laying hens were obtained from a local poultry facility and subsequently housed at the Poultry Research Facility at the University of California Riverside ( UCR ) Agricultural Operations . Hens were 22 weeks old at week 1 of the study . Egg-lay began at ca. 19 weeks old , but production parameters were not recorded as part of the study . This study was approved by and conducted in accordance with the University of California Riverside Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . Two structures ( 3.8 by 5.8 ? m ) were divided into two separate sections , creating four ' poultry houses ' each with 12 birds ( a ' flock ' ) . Each poultry house was equipped with water dispensers , feed troughs , and nest boxes , and had bird density which met or exceeded US standards for cage-free production22 . Straw bedding ( 5 -- 10 ? cm in depth ) was added to each house at the beginning of the study and was not removed until the study concluded . Lights were kept on a 16:8 ( L:D ) h cycle . Each hen within a flock was uniquely marked with coloured leg bands for individual bird identification . One bird in flock 3 was removed during week 11 due to injury and was not replaced . <h> Mites <p> Experimental birds were inoculated with northern fowl mites as described by Martin and Mullens6 . Briefly , northern fowl mites were aspirated using glass pipettes from source birds maintained at the UCR Poultry Research Facility . Approximately 30 adult mites were placed at the base of feathers in the vent region ( underside ) of each chicken to ensure a similar level of mite exposure to each bird . Mite numbers were expected to rapidly increase from this initial low level as the mite life cycle is short , requiring as few as 5 days to go from egg to adult23 . Mites were placed onto birds at week 4 ( all flocks ) and again at weeks 14 and 15 ( flocks 3 and 4 only ) to reinfest birds treated with acaricide during weeks 9 and 11 as indicated in the study design below . The vent-area feathers of each bird were visually examined and mite density was scored by a single researcher for consistency of counts using the following scoring system ( mite score ? = ? # mites ) : 1 ? = ? 1 -- 10 , 2 ? = ? 11 -- 50 , 3 ? = ? 51 -- 100 , 4 ? = ? 101 -- 500 , 5 ? = ? 501 -- 1000 , 6 ? = ? 1001 -- 10,000 , and 7 ? &gt; ? 10,00024 . Mite scores for all birds were tracked weekly from week 4 through week 20 . <h> Behaviour <p> Three-axis accelerometers ( "" sensors "" ) ( AX3 , Axivity Ltd , UK ) were used to record the direction and magnitude of acceleration as birds altered body position or moved within the poultry house . Sensors were placed in plastic "" backpacks "" ( Hero 4 AHDBT-401 plastic case , Amazon.com , Seattle , WA , USA ) affixed to the back of each bird using elastic bands stretched around the base of each wing ( Fig. 1 ) . Sensor data were collected at a rate of 100 ? Hz ( ca. 100 readings/sec ) . <p> A "" behaviour dictionary "" was developed which allowed for the classification of behaviours performed by birds from sensor data25 . Sensor data used to build and test the behaviour dictionary was collected from 10 different birds ( recorded for = 4 ? hours at a time ) over the span of several months . Video recordings of the test birds were synced with sensor output data , and visually observable and distinct behaviours were annotated by a single observer using ELAN open-access software ( Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics , The Language Archive , Nijmegen , The Netherlands , v. 5.2 , https : **34;1240;TOOLONG ) . **788;1276;p Algorithms to classify bird behaviours were developed from annotated hen activity data29 . Algorithms were a Nearest-Neighbour Classifier containing one or more examples of each behaviour of interest and utilized a rejection threshold . The reason why we need to allow for multiple examples of each behaviour is that behaviours can be polymorphic . For example , pecking at the ground may manifest differently than pecking at a raised bowl , or a peck may become less frenetic as the bird becomes satiated . <p> We estimated the accuracy of our algorithm using cross validation , a standard procedure in the machine learning literature , by careful annotation of video that was recorded in parallel with sensor data to test how our model classified each video snippet . The model 's accuracy in distinguishing between the three behaviours of interest , pecking vs. preening vs. dustbathing is near perfect , as these look radically different in the feature space . The more important metric is our recognition accuracy ; how accurately we detect a behaviour vs. non-examples of that behaviour , for example pecking vs. non-pecking . Under this metric , our model 's F-score , where ( F=2times fracprecisiontimes recallprecision+recall ) , for the three behaviours of interest is : Dustbathing : 1.00 ; Preening : 1.00 ; Pecking : 0.88 . Both dustbathing and preening are very distinctive in our feature space and offer few challenges . The pecking behaviour is more difficult , as our algorithm sometimes confuses fast walking movements for pecking . The numbers above reflect a slightly improved version of the algorithm presented in29 , the improved version of the algorithm is under review and may be accessed here30 . <h> Welfare <p> Chickens were visually assessed and scored for physical condition of welfare quality based on an adaptation of the Welfare Quality protocol15 by Blatchford et al.31 . The Welfare Quality assessment is a frequently used research tool with a validated set of measures used as a basis for recording animal welfare conditions32 . Briefly , each bird was examined for abnormal condition of the eyes , comb , beak , keel , feet , toes , skin and feather condition ( Table 1 ) . All metrics were scored as a 0 , 1 , or 2 ( 0 ? = ? absent , 1 = present and moderate , 2 = present and severe ) . Flocks were pooled for welfare analyses at weeks 1 , 4 , 7 , and 12 . At week 19 , flocks 1 and 2 were mite-free while flocks 3 and 4 were mite infested ; at this time point flocks were pooled by mite status for analysis . <h> Study design <p> The study was conducted over 20 wk from November 2017 to April 2018 . On a single date during week 1 , week 4 , and then weekly thereafter each chicken in all four poultry flocks was visually examined and scored for mites ( Table 2 ) . Birds were initially free of mites in week 1 but were unintentionally infested with a low level of NFM by week 4 ( 45/48 birds infested ) ( Fig. 2 ) . After week 4 mite scoring , all birds were deliberately infested with additional NFM ( as described above ) to ensure that all birds in each flock were exposed to a similar infestation level of mites from weeks 5 -- 9 . At weeks 9 and 11 all birds were treated with an acaricide , RaVap ( Bayer , Shawnee Mission , Kansas , USA ) , following label instructions to eliminate mites . At week 14 , birds in flocks 3 and 4 only were reinfested with NFM , leaving flocks 1 and 2 as comparative controls for the remainder of the study . Flocks 1 and 2 were treated with RaVap again at week 16 to ensure they remained uninfested through the end of the study at week 20 . <p> Average ( ? SE ) mite scores for each chicken flock . All birds were uninfested at week 1 , but 45 of 48 birds were unintentionally ( naturally ) infested with a low number of mites at an undetermined time prior to week 4 when birds were next examined for mites and the study was initiated by deliberate infestation of birds with mites . Black dashed arrows indicate when mites were added to individual birds in all flocks at week 4 , and to flocks 3 &amp; 4 only at week 14 . Black solid arrows indicate weeks when acaricide treatments were applied to all flocks ( weeks 9 and 11 ) or to flocks 1 &amp; 2 only ( week 16 ) . The mite scoring system used ( score ? = ? # NFM per bird ) is as follows : 1 ? = ? 1 -- 10 , 2 ? = ? 11 -- 50 , 3 ? = ? 51 -- 100 , 4 ? = ? 101 -- 500 , 5 ? = ? 501 -- 1000 , 6 ? = ? 1001 -- 10,000 , and 7 ? &gt; ? 10,000 . <p> After recording mite scores during weeks 1 , 4 , 7 , 12 , and 19 , each chicken was also scored for welfare quality metrics , then fitted with a sensor to record bird behaviour for 1 wk ( Table 2 ) . After each 1-wk recording period , data were downloaded from each sensor and run through the developed algorithm described above25,28 to identify and tally each behaviour event recorded for the defined behaviours of interest . Detailed sensor data are provided as supplementary material ( Supplementary 1 ) and are also available here25 . <h> Statistical analyses <p> To determine whether bird behaviours differed across time for each flock , a general linear model ( PROC GLM ) was used with number of behaviour events as the response variable and study week as the independent variable , with means separated by Tukey HSD for each behaviour . <p> Differences in the number of behaviour events over time were further analysed using mixed-model repeated-measures ( PROC MIXED ) with NFM score , flock , and bird ID ( subject ) as fixed effects and study week as a random effect . Initially a comprehensive model was used , but subsequent analyses were separated by flock when significant differences by flock were found . <p> Welfare metric scores were ordinal , therefore nonparametric tests ( PROC NPAR1WAY ) were used for analyses . All flocks were pooled for welfare analyses , except for week 19 data when flock 1 &amp; 2 ( uninfested flocks ) were pooled separately from flock 3 &amp; 4 ( NFM-infested flocks ) . Each study week was separated for analysis . Kruskall-Wallis tests were used to determine whether welfare metric scores varied by NFM infestation for each welfare metric ( comb wounds , skin lesions , or soiled feathers ) with prevalence or severity as the response variable and NFM score as the class variable . Mann-Whitney tests were used to make comparisons for each welfare metric between week 1 ( no mites ) as compared to weeks 4 ( low mites ) , 7 ( high mites ) , 12 ( post-trt , no mites ) , or 19 ( post-trt , F3&amp;4 w/mites ) . Welfare metric prevalence was the response variable and week was the class variable . <p> Behaviour events ( mean ? ? ? SE ) by week for each flock . Bars with the same letter are not significantly different within a flock ( P ? &gt; ? 0.05 ) . The mite status at each week is as follows : week 1 = no mites , week 4 = low mites , week 7 = high mites , week 12 = treated ; no mites , week 19 = no mites in flocks 1 &amp; 2 , mites present in flocks 3 &amp; 4 . <h> Welfare <p> Throughout the study all welfare metrics observed other than those related to comb , skin , and feather condition were consistently scored as normal ( score ? = ? 0 ) or were rarely scored as abnormal ( score ? = ? 1 or 2 ) and were thus not further analysed . In contrast , the welfare conditions of comb wounds , skin lesions , and feather soiling were more often scored as abnormal and are therefore analysed below relative to levels of mite infestation . The complete welfare metrics data set is provided as supplementary material ( Supplementary 2 ) . <p> Welfare metrics recorded during week 1 of the study , when all birds were free of mites , were used as a baseline for comparison of welfare throughout the rest of the study as mite numbers fluctuated . During week 1 , birds were free of comb wounds and skin lesions , and only 2/48 birds showed any feather soiling ( Fig. 5 ) . <h> Soiled feathers <p> The number of birds with soiled feathers between week 1 ( baseline ) and week 4 ( low mites ) was the same , with only 2/48 birds with soiled feathers ( Fig. 5 ) . This increased to 7/48 birds when mite levels were high ( week 7 ) , with 6 moderate and 1 severe case . This was not statistically different from week 1 soiled feather prevalence ( X2 ? = ? 3.03 , df = 1 , P ? = ? 0.0816 ) . However , mite score did relate to the severity of feather soiling when mites were high ( X2 ? = ? 12.8 , df = 3 , P ? = ? 0.005 ) ( Fig. 7 ) . After mite treatment at week 12 , only one bird had soiled feathers . This barely increased at week 19 , where 2/24 mite-free and 1/23 mite-infested birds exhibited soiled feathers ( all moderate ) . <h> Discussion <p> On-animal sensors have been used to track or describe the behaviours performed by a variety of animals including livestock ( e.g.26,33,34,35,36 . In cattle , this technology has been used to track herd movements33 including movement of animals exposed to biting flies34 . For poultry , sensors have been developed to help with surveillance for high pathogenic avian influenza by detecting periods of below-average activity for birds , a sign of illness37 . Behaviour has also been used as a monitoring tool for food-borne pathogens of broilers ( meat birds ) 38 . The Axivity accelerometers used in the current study were developed for use on human subjects and were advantageous because of their small size , light weight , and waterproof case . The accelerometers also record the data locally ( on the device ) which eliminates the need for subjects to remain close to a receiver ( that collects the data remotely ) and reduces the risk of lost data ( that can occur when using a receiver ) . At 100 ? Hz the Axivity accelerometers can record up to 14 days of data uninterrupted which allowed us to record very large data sets for each individual bird . Published resources exist for analysing or describing animal behaviours from collected accelerometer data e.g.39,40,41 . The present study uses a unique approach of analysing shape and feature of accelerometer data to create the behaviour dictionary which describes specific behaviours rather than describing general animal movements28 . All of these materials , including software with a user-friendly interface , are now available for researchers to use32 . <p> Flocks exhibited similar welfare metrics at week 1 ( no mites ) and week 4 ( low mites ) , suggesting that a low initial mite score does not substantially impact bird welfare , or that impacts are too low to observe using the current welfare metric scoring system . By week 7 , welfare impacts were noted with high prevalence and severity of skin lesions being positively associated with increasing mite score . Skin lesions disappeared ( healed ) by week 12 after elimination of mites with an acaricidal treatment . Following reinfestation of flocks 3 &amp; 4 with mites at week 14 , birds in these flocks again showed increased prevalence of skin lesions relative to mite-free flocks near the end of the study ( week 19 ) , providing further support that high mite numbers are associated with increased prevalence and severity of skin lesions on infested birds . Skin lesions are likely related to the bird 's immune response to mite feeding in the vent region13 where all skin lesions were observed . All birds were beak trimmed , a common industry practice42 , so skin lesions detected were not likely caused by preening behaviour , though this behaviour also increased for birds as mite infestation levels increased . <p> Preening behaviour was positively influenced by NFM scores , with the greatest number of preening events recorded when mite populations were highest in all flocks at week 7 . Vezzoli et al.18 investigated the effects of NFM infestation on chicken preening and found that NFM-infested birds did not spend more time preening overall , but rather that preening became more concentrated in the vent area . In the present study , we can not differentiate where preening behaviours were directed , just that the behaviour increased over time . Increased preening in the vent area may be a direct response to mite biting , or an indirect response to mite feeding which can cause skin inflammation13 and may also initiate a histamine response resulting in an itch sensation43 . While Vezzoli et al.18 did not find an increase in preening behaviour in mite-infested chickens , these authors recorded preening behaviour only over a couple of hours during a single time of day ( afternoon ) and additionally birds were held in cages , which may have restricted their behaviours . In contrast , the present study showed an increase in preening behaviour for mite-infested chickens probably due to the much greater volume of data for analysis that was available by using sensors applied to individual birds and by capturing behaviour data constantly over several days ' time . <p> Dustbathing is a complex innate behaviour typically performed by each bird for 30 ? min every other day44 to keep feathers in good condition26,45 . Chickens exhibit dustbathing behaviour at a young age when given access to appropriate substrate , and expression of this behaviour is maintained throughout the life of the bird . However , external factors can have a strong effect on expression of this behaviour causing changes in frequency and duration . Dustbathing may be socially facilitated46 and variation among individuals may be influenced by social hierarchy47 . In addition , dustbathing behaviour by individual birds is known to vary from week to week7 . Dustbathing is a circadian behaviour that occurs infrequently , and data collection that is not restricted to a single time of day is best for sampling this type of behaviour48 . In the present study dustbathing behaviour was greatest at week 7 when mite scores were highest . Following the elimination of mites from birds , dustbathing was reduced in all flocks until mites were reintroduced to flocks 3 &amp; 4 at week 14 , whereupon dustbathing increased again in flock 4 but not in flock 3 . The cause of this difference in dustbathing between the reinfested flocks is unknown and may be due to some environmental condition that was not detectable or observed . A previous study found no effect of NFM infestation on frequency or duration of dustbathing behaviour17 , however this study was limited to caged birds . While , increasing NFM was associated with greater dustbathing during the first part of the current study , the lack of consistency in this relationship following mite reinfestation of flocks 3&amp;4 indicates that mite impacts on dustbathing behaviour needs further examination . <p> Pecking was a stable behaviour that did not change much over time after week 4 . The small increase in pecking behaviour from week 1 to week 4 is perhaps explained by increased need for food consumption as birds increased in body size with age particularly during the earliest weeks of the study . Increases in preening and dustbathing through week 7 were not associated with a decrease in pecking behaviours . Future work can help determine if mite-driven behaviours are influencing normal periods of rest or inactivity for birds . This may be an important step to understanding overall mite effects on chicken well-being , energy expenditure , and economic output . This may be especially important for organic or pasture-raised birds that have the ability to spend time outside and provide important ecosystem services , such as pasture fertilization and pest management , particularly when chickens are used as part of a multi-animal species pasture rotation system4 . <p> Parasites may impose behavioural and energy costs on their hosts . For example , wild birds with high nematode parasite loads had reduced flight time relative to birds with lower parasite loads , perhaps as a result of the higher energy expenditure associated with flight activity for heavily parasitized birds49 . If maximum energy expenditure remains constant even under stress of parasitaemia , as suggested by49 , then any increase in specific chicken behaviours as a result of increasing mite density would be offset by decreases in other activities or decreased duration or intensity of behaviours . In the current study , we did not determine energy expenditures of mite-parasitized or unparasitized chickens , nor did we monitor the duration or intensity of behaviours other than those discussed in this study which were anticipated to perhaps be impacted by parasitaemia . Also , since chickens in the current study were provided food ad libitum , perhaps any additional energy expenditure associated with parasitaemia could be compensated for by increased feed consumption . A previous study found no effect of NFM infestation on laying hen resting metabolic rate , though feed intake relative to egg output was significantly affected by the presence of mites ( i.e. feed intake increased ) 50 . <p> In this study , individual animal behaviours were highly variable from day-to-day and by individual , but patterns did emerge among flocks , particularly related to mite infestation level . NFM infestation was shown to increase hen preening behaviour and to increase the presence of skin lesions which are important as a measure of animal welfare . Use of on-animal sensors allows for the collection of very large datasets and the ability to track behaviours continuously for several days which can mitigate the effects of limited sampling interval and duration typical when using direct observation of animals by researchers in behaviour studies48 . On-animal sensors allow for continuous data collection without the time and labour commitment of traditional observational studies . Future studies will likely move toward use of sensors that record accelerometer data in real-time to make instantaneous observations of animal behaviour allowing for real-time decisions regarding animal health or management needs . <h> Contributions <p> A.C.M. designed and conducted experimental work , data analysis and prepared the first manuscript draft ; A.C.G. assisted with experimental design and data analysis .

"<h> Abstract <p> This study starts from the counterintuitive question of how we can render conventional stiff , nonstretchable , and even brittle materials sufficiently conformable to fully wrap curved surfaces , such as spheres , without failure . Here , we extend the geometrical design method of computational origami to wrapping . Our computational wrapping approach provides a robust and reliable method for fabricating conformal devices for arbitrary curved surfaces with a computationally designed nonpolyhedral developable net . This computer-aided design transforms two-dimensional ( 2D ) -- based materials , such as Si wafers and steel sheets , into various targeted conformal structures that can fully wrap desired 3D structures without fracture or severe plastic deformation . We further demonstrate that our computational wrapping approach enables a design platform that can transform conventional nonstretchable 2D-based devices , such as electroluminescent lighting and flexible batteries , into conformal 3D curved devices . <h> INTRODUCTION <p> The development of new flexible and stretchable materials has recently generated substantial interest in fabricating conformal devices that can conform to the target three-dimensional ( 3D ) surface ( 1 -- 5 ) . However , the application of such materials for practical conformal electronics remains strictly limited by the inability to provide certain key criteria available in conventional electronic products , such as high conductivity and reliability . While the majority of works involving conformal devices have used soft and stretchable materials , there are a few works that have pioneered conformal devices made of conventional nonstretchable or brittle materials such as silicon and metal . Nevertheless , those pioneered works have used the conventional materials in a limited area of the devices with very thin "" patterned structures "" such as horseshoe patterns ( 6 -- 8 ) . In other words , it is still challenging to cover an entire 3D surface with conventional materials used in the advanced devices ( 9 , 10 ) . This study introduces a universal method to use conventional nonstretchable materials to reliably wrap arbitrary 3D curved surfaces , including the human body and curved vehicle interiors , as potential applications . This approach allows us to make conformal devices without sacrificing performance . <p> Figure 1A shows that wrapping a sphere with a rectangular piece of paper inevitably results in the formation of wrinkles , crumples , and overlaps regardless of the material type , including stretchable sheets . If the material is a substrate or another active layer of a flexible device , then severe material deformation and overlapping can cause the material to fracture or break , as shown in fig . S1 and movie S1 . One common way to wrap 3D surfaces with nonstretchable materials is by introducing patterned cuts in the materials . Recent examples of patterned cuts are lattice cut patterns and fractal cut patterns . Cho et al . ( 11 ) proposed a fractal cut design approach for planar materials that enabled the production of mechanical metamaterials with a hierarchical auxetic structure . They showed that the fractal cut-designed materials are shape programmable and can effectively cover a sphere . In addition , Konakovic et al . ( 12 ) suggested computer algorithms for designing complex 3D models using 2D auxetic structures . Both studies overcame the limitations of existing flexible materials by geometrically designing cut patterns . However , when covering complex 3D surfaces , these structures inevitably result in openings that lead to the design and functional limitations in conformal devices , such as suboptimal coverage of printable batteries and undesirable holes in lighting and displays ( Fig. 1B ) . To overcome this problem , we introduce a computational design strategy called "" computational wrapping with nonpolyhedral developable nets "" to make a 2D nonstretchable material platform to fabricate wearable and conformal devices . <p> ( A ) Wrinkles are formed when tightly wrapping a rectangular sheet of paper around a nonzero Gaussian surface . ( B ) Fractal cut patterns can avoid wrinkles but inevitably lead to openings and uncovered areas . ( C ) The 2D unfolding of a spherical polyhedron generated automatically by computational origami can wrap a steel ball without leaving uncovered areas . ( D ) As the number of facets increases , the smoothness and conformability of the mesh naturally improve . The difference in surface area between the perfect sphere and the approximated polyhedra decreases by 5.3% when the number of facets increases from 80 to 500 . The Hausdorff distance between the polyhedral surfaces and the perfect sphere also reduces from 7.05 to 1.17% of the radius of the perfect sphere when the number of facets increases from 80 to 500 ( see also fig . S4 ) . ( Photo credit : Y.-K . Lee , Seoul National University . ) <h> RESULTS AND DISCUSSION <p> Figure 1C shows a series of snapshots that illustrate the 2D unfolding of a sphere generated automatically by our polyhedral edge unfolding algorithm , which is used to wrap a steel ball . Theoretically , a curved surface can be characterized by the Gaussian curvature , which is the vector product of the maximum and minimum principal curvatures at a point . A 2D material with zero Gaussian curvature at all points , such as a sheet of paper , is called a developable surface . A developable surface can not be transformed into a nondevelopable 3D surface with positive or negative Gaussian curvatures without tearing , stretching , or compressing the material . This has been mathematically proven by the "" Gauss Theorema Egregium , "" which states that "" To move a surface onto another surface , the Gaussian curvature of all corresponding points must match "" ( 13 ) ( fig . S2 ) . Instead , polyhedral edge unfolding ( 14 , 15 ) flattens arbitrary surfaces into 2D structures by cutting the surface into developable patches with C0 continuity ; i.e. , the patches are connected without gaps and seams . The computer science community has recently exerted great efforts to algorithmically determine surface cuts that segment a nondevelopable surface into developable surface patches called polyhedral nets ( or simply nets ) ( 16 -- 18 ) . Beyond designing valid nets , recent computational methods , including those developed by the authors ( 19 -- 22 ) , have focused on optimizing net quality and foldability using machine learning techniques that drastically reduce the time and effort needed relative to traditional trial-and-error approaches . <p> A polyhedron can have multiple possible polyhedral nets ( 23 ) , especially when the polyhedron is convex . For a given polyhedral sphere , we demonstrate six unfoldings created by six different methods ( fig . S3 ) . Figure S3A shows the "" steepest edge ( SE ) unfolding "" ( 16 ) . Given a polyhedron P and a 3D vector c ? , SE unfolding associates each edge e = ( v , w ) of P with a weight &lt;c , v-w&gt;v-w , where v and w are the end points of e and &lt; , &gt; denotes the inner product between two vectors . Then , for each vertex v , the edge incident to v with the largest weight , i.e. , the edge most aligned with c ? , is cut . The SE unfolding can unfold nearly all convex polyhedra with a few randomly selected c ? , creating radially spread unfolded figures . Other methods , such as flat-tree unfolding ( fig . S3B ) ( 16 ) and genetic algorithm ( GA ) methods ( 22 , 24 ) , are also available to unfold nonconvex polyhedra ( fig . S3C ) . As it is critically important that a conformal device is composed of one or as few pieces as possible , our recently developed GA method can evolve the unfoldings by mutating the edge weights until a net with zero overlaps is found ( 22 ) . This evolution is controlled by a fitness function f : N ? R that evaluates an unfolding . An example of f(N) is defined as followsf(N)=- ( ? 0d0+ ? 1d1 ) where d0 is the number of overlaps in N , d1 is the number of hyperbolic vertices that cause local overlaps in N , and ? 0 and ? 1 are user parameters , which are set to 100 and 1 , respectively . The maximum value of f(N) must be 0 . In addition , three more unfolding algorithms are presented in fig . S3 . Although all of these algorithms can be used depending on the required application , we chose the SE unfolding and GA methods to further illustrate our notion of wrapping a 3D curved surface via computational unfolding methods . <p> Figure 1D illustrates four different unfolding paper structures that were fabricated from four polyhedral spheres with different resolutions via the computational SE unfolding method . To ensure that the polyhedral sphere can tightly enclose a perfect sphere so that the facets of the polyhedron touch the perfect sphere , the polyhedral sphere must be properly scaled . Consequently , to ensure the enclosure of the perfect sphere , the radius and surface area ( 4pr2 ) of the polyhedron with 80 facets are 7.05 and 6.38% larger than those of a perfect sphere , respectively . The difference in the radii of the polyhedral sphere and the perfect sphere decreases to 1.17% when the number of facets increases to 500 . The area difference is also reduced as the mesh number increases , resulting in a 1.09% difference for a polyhedron with 500 facets ( fig . S4 ) . Consequently , increasing the resolution of meshes for paper polyhedra provides better conformability on the steel ball , as shown in fig . S4D . In many applications of conformal devices , accurate covering and tight wrapping are crucial . In addition , because most real-world objects are smooth and curved , high-resolution meshes are needed to provide the necessary covering accuracy . However , there are still issues in folding the creases to cover the surface , which requires a long folding time during fabrication and possibly causes mechanical fracture or plastic deformation of the materials used , leading to electrical failure in devices . Here , we develop an approach called "" computational wrapping , "" which goes beyond the conventional computational folding method . By considering conformal device design as a paper wrapping problem instead of a paper folding ( origami ) problem , we recognize that the operations of attaching and wrapping conformal devices to cover an underlying curved 3D surface are made much easier by bending and pressing a polyhedral net without creases than by creasing and folding , as illustrated in Fig. 2A . <p> ( A ) When the sum of the folding angles of a net is minimized , the crease lines can be ignored to accommodate flexible but nonstretchable stiff and brittle materials . For 500 meshes , the gaps in the case of a rigid material and the wrinkles in the case of a flexible material are no longer visible , and the difference between the two becomes imperceptible . ( B ) A nonstretchable stainless steel sheet is cut into a developable net . ( C ) With a sufficient number of meshes , the stainless steel sheet can be bent and fully wrap a sphere without creasing or folding . ( D ) Part of the sphere is unfolded with 400 meshes , and the crease lines are removed . ( E ) A 20- ? m-thick brittle Si wafer is cut into an unfolded net with a laser cutter . ( F ) The cut Si wafer stably wraps both convex and concave frames . ( Photo credit : Y.-K . Lee , Seoul National University . ) <p> Paradoxically , we found that in this bending and attaching approach , high-resolution meshes provide us with the needed solution to address the limitations of long fabrication times and mechanical reliability . A mesh with high-resolution tessellation can better represent surfaces with a higher degree of continuity ( e.g. , G1 continuity along the branches where facets on both sides of a crease line share a common tangent direction ) , which is common for many surfaces formed by real materials . <p> Computationally , this goal is achieved by ensuring that the distance between the wrapped object and the developable surface is smaller than a user-provided value based on the required wrapping tightness and the material properties . For example , a surface with nonzero Gaussian curvature everywhere , such as a perfect sphere , can be enclosed by a developable surface ; however , there will always be spaces between these two surfaces . To control the size of this space , we adaptively refine the facet mesh until the two-sided Hausdorff distance between the developable surface formed by the polyhedral net and the wrapped object is bounded . More specifically , we modify the GA fitness function in our edge unfolding method as followsf(N)=min ( - ( ? 0d0+ ? 1d1 ) , ? ei ? ei ) where ? ei is the dihedral angle of a cut edge ei in the polyhedral net N. This enhanced f(N) further evolves N to minimize the sum of the folding angles , and the net is thus optimized for bending by maximizing f(N) . After obtaining a polyhedral paper net with minimal folding angles ( Fig. 2A , top ) , we use the outer cut lines of the net but ignore ( erase ) all the crease lines ; the result is called a nonpolyhedral developable net ( Fig. 2A , bottom ) . The distance between the target shape and the developable surface formed by its nonpolyhedral developable net ( referred to as "" developable net "" hereinafter ) is calculated . Our method then determines the areas that require more detailed tessellation , e.g. , areas with high Gaussian curvature , and repeats the process ( remeshing , unfolding , and distance estimation ) until the distance is sufficiently short . Therefore , given a polyhedral net with a high-resolution mesh , because there is a small distance between the perfect sphere and the developable surface formed by its developable net , we can ignore ( erase ) all the crease lines and simply bend and press the strips of the developable paper net to tightly wrap the sphere , creating controlled and bounded spaces between the net and the sphere without gaps or overlaps between facets ( see fig . S4 regarding the required mesh numbers for smooth wrapping ) . Consequently , this fabrication process can accurately produce highly complex and smooth 3D surfaces and is many times faster than the conventional computational folding method when handling complex shapes because there is no creasing and folding involved in the wrapping procedure . Moreover , we note that the small bending angles of the strips possibly prevent the materials used in conformal devices from being damaged when wrapping an object . <p> This computational wrapping scheme based on developable nets enables our method to be applied not only to papers but also to metallic and ceramic materials . For the same developable net generated with 500 meshes , a stainless steel sheet can tightly wrap a steel ball , as shown in Fig. 2 ( B and C ) . Moreover , we can even apply our method to brittle Si wafers . We fabricated a computational wrapping pattern for a Si wafer to cover part of a sphere with a diameter of 4 cm , as shown in Fig. 2D . A thin Si wafer with a thickness of 20 ? m was cut by laser cutting based on a computed developable net consisting of 400 meshes without crease lines ( Fig. 2 , D and E ) . We attached this wafer to both convex and concave surfaces without noticeable gaps , overlaps , or fractures ( Fig. 2F ) . A finite element ( FE ) analysis of the Si wafer in Fig. 3 provides more quantitative mechanical analysis supporting the assertion that the computational wrapping process for the Si wafer is mechanically reliable . The wrapping process is realized in the FE simulation by compressing the developable net between the sphere and a concave mold of a wrapped part of the sphere ( Fig. 3A and movie S2 ) . In the FE simulation , the radius of the sphere is set to 2 cm , replicating the radius of the sphere used in the experiment ( Fig. 2G ) , and the radius of the concave mold is set to the sum of 2 cm and the 2D net thickness . The developable nets with different numbers of meshes are generated by the GA method , and the computational models for the FE simulation are constructed with adaptive meshing ( Fig. 3B ) . <p> The mechanical reliability of the computational wrapping of the Si wafer shown in Fig. 2F is further investigated through FE simulations for wrapping a part of a sphere . ( A ) The wrapping process is simulated by compressing the 2D nonpolyhedral developable net between the sphere and a concave mold of a wrapped part of the sphere ( see also movie S2 ) . The radius of the sphere in the FE simulation is identical to that used in our experiment ( Fig. 2F ) . ( B ) The nonpolyhedral developable nets are generated by the GA method . The distributions of the maximum in-plane principal stress for the wrapped Si wafers are analyzed ( C ) with respect to the number of meshes at a fixed thickness of 20 ? m and ( D ) with respect to the thickness at 400 meshes . Consequently , the maximum in-plane principal stress decreases as the number of meshes increases and increases as the thickness increases ( E and F ) . In both cases , the maximum stress values are much smaller than the fracture strength of the Si wafer . <p> Figure 3C shows that for the 20- ? m-thick Si wafer wrapping the part of the sphere , the maximum in-plane principal stress distribution indicates that the stress decreases as the number of meshes increases from 50 , 100 , 200 , to 400 . Consequently , the highest value of the maximum in-plane principal stress in Fig. 3E decreases from 624 MPa for 50 meshes to 193 MPa for 400 meshes . These stress values are much smaller than the fracture strength of the Si wafer , which is approximately 5 GPa ( 25 , 26 ) . This finding clearly indicates that by maximizing f(N) , the bending angles of the strips are minimized to ensure minimal stress and strain , thereby preventing the occurrence of fracture or severe plastic deformation . We also simulated the maximum in-plane principal stress distribution in the wrapped Si wafer with 400 meshes under various thicknesses ( 20 , 50 , 100 , and 125 ? m ) , and the results are shown in Fig. 3D . The residual stress is developed throughout the developable net as the thickness increases to 125 ? m . The highest value of the maximum in-plane principal stress is 1.093 GPa , which is still less than the fracture strength of the Si wafer ( see fig . S5 for an additional FE analysis of a stainless steel sheet ) . <p> The above results have significant practical implications . Most flexible devices are made from 2D brittle substrate materials that can be slightly bent at a small angle only if the aspect ratio is sufficiently large ( 27 ) . As long as we can make 2D unfolding structures , we can use conventional materials and processes , such as deposition and evaporation to wrap a curved surface with a conformal device . Hence , these structures lead to a significant increase in the applicability of computational origami to real industrial fabrication processes , wherein wrapping can be used instead of folding to fabricate conformal devices . For instance , in this study , we realize a conformal device using commercial electroluminescent lamp ( EL ) panels . We simply use a laser cutter to cut the commercial EL panels , including the power supply terminals at the end of an edge site , corresponding to the computationally generated developable net of a sphere and an ellipsoid with 500 meshes . The final cut EL panels can be stably and easily attached to the sphere ( Fig. 4 , A to C ) and the ellipsoid ( Fig. 4 , D and E , and fig . S6 ) . The EL panels consist of top and bottom brittle electrodes with solid interlayers ( including an indium tin oxide conductive layer ) that can be easily fractured by creasing and folding . However , no catastrophic failures occurred during the fabrication process , and the 3D conformal device exhibited good operation , as shown in Fig. 4 ( C and E ) , because we conformally wrapped the sphere by bending and pressing rather than creasing and folding . In addition to a sphere and an ellipsoid model , a traditional Korean mask was conformably wrapped by EL panels . We used 3D scanning to obtain a 3D model and generate meshes for the most curved region of the mask . For the traditional Korean mask model , a total of 169 meshes are used for the target region , which are unfolded with the SE unfolding method without overlapping ( Fig. 4 , F and G , and fig . S7 ) . Last , the EL panel with a developable net was conformally attached to the mask , and the panel exhibited good operation without failure . The concept was applied for complex exterior parts of an electric toy vehicle with a nonzero Gaussian surface . We generated the meshes and the corresponding developable net via the GA unfolding method , as shown in fig . S8 , and then EL panels were cut and attached to the surfaces to decorate the exterior car parts ( Fig. 4 , H to J , fig . S8 , and movie S3 ) . We also fabricated a conformal primary battery . For battery fabrication , the diversity of the developable net can yield advantages in terms of manufacturing efficiency and printing material waste reduction for screen prints ( fig . S9 ) . <p> ( A ) Cuttable , nonstretchable , commercial EL panels consisting of brittle electrodes are cut with a laser cutter to form developable nets for a sphere . ( B ) EL panels with a developable net can fully cover a sphere and ( C ) operate without catastrophic failure . ( D and E ) The computational wrapping concept is also demonstrated for an ellipsoid model ( see fig . S6 ) . ( F and G ) In addition to a sphere and an ellipsoid , a commercial Korean facial mask can also be conformably covered with EL panels and operated without electrical failure ( fig . S7 ) . ( H ) An electric toy vehicle can also be conformably wrapped with EL panels in the same manner , and the attached EL panels also operate well without failure . The GA unfolding method is used for generating the developable net for parts with nonzero Gaussian surfaces , including ( I ) the headlights , the edge of the front side bumper , and ( J ) the edge of the rear side bumper of the electric toy vehicle ( fig . S8 ) . ( Photo credit : Y.-K . Lee , Seoul National University . ) <p> In summary , we introduced the concept of computational wrapping to transform nonstretchable 2D flexible devices into 3D conformal devices . A surface with nonzero Gaussian curvature , such as a perfect sphere , can be enclosed by a developable surface , but there will always be spaces between these two surfaces . The proposed computational method controls the distance between these two surfaces to ensure sufficiently tight wrapping . Although approximating an arbitrary surface with developable surfaces has also been studied in the past , all existing works break the surface into multiple separated developable surfaces . Our work produces a single connected surface , called nonpolyhedral developable net , which is a conformal wrapping design of a 2D sheet for any 3D surface . Nonpolyhedral developable net enables applications that require connectivity and conductivity between all pairs of points on the surface . In particular , we successfully showed that slightly bending nonstretchable substrates to comply with an underlying object can effectively wrap the desired shape without forming crease lines between adjacent facets . Consequently , stiff or even brittle materials , such as metal sheets or Si wafers , can fully cover and tightly wrap nonzero Gaussian curvature surfaces without catastrophic fractures . We demonstrated that the advantages of wrapping over folding can be applied to make real conformal devices from conventional devices , such as EL lighting devices and batteries . Our universal computational wrapping method provides new insights into the development of conformal devices with arbitrary shapes using efficient algorithms with robust and reliable conventional fabrication processes . <h> MATERIALS AND METHODS <h> Computational methods <p> The nonpolyhedral developable net was generated by our computational algorithm .

The mechanical reliability of computational wrapping was verified through FE simulations ABAQUS/Explicit ( version 6.14 ) , wherein a part of a sphere was wrapped . The computational models for the FE simulations were constructed with adaptive meshing .

This has in part contributed to long wait times for a diagnosis and subsequent delays in access to therapy . We hypothesize that the use of machine learning analysis on home video can speed the diagnosis without compromising accuracy . We have analyzed item-level records from 2 standard diagnostic instruments to construct machine learning classifiers optimized for sparsity , interpretability , and accuracy . In the present study , we prospectively test whether the features from these optimized models can be extracted by blinded nonexpert raters from 3-minute home videos of children with and without ASD to arrive at a rapid and accurate machine learning autism classification . <h> Methods and findings <p> We created a mobile web portal for video raters to assess 30 behavioral features ( e.g. , eye contact , social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models for identifying ASD , each with &gt;94% accuracy in cross-validation testing and subsequent independent validation from previous work . We then collected 116 short home videos of children with autism ( mean age = 4 years 10 months , SD = 2 years 3 months ) and 46 videos of typically developing children ( mean age = 2 years 11 months , SD = 1 year 2 months ) . Three raters blind to the diagnosis independently measured each of the 30 features from the 8 models , with a median time to completion of 4 minutes . Although several models ( consisting of alternating decision trees , support vector machine SVM , logistic regression ( LR ) , radial kernel , and linear SVM ) performed well , a sparse 5-feature LR classifier ( LR5 ) yielded the highest accuracy ( area under the curve AUC : 92% 95% CI 88% -- 97% ) across all ages tested . We used a prospectively collected independent validation set of 66 videos ( 33 ASD and 33 non-ASD ) and 3 independent rater measurements to validate the outcome , achieving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 81% -- 95% ) . Finally , we applied LR to the 162-video-feature matrix to construct an 8-feature model , which achieved 0.93 AUC ( 95% CI 0.90 -- 0.97 ) on the held-out test set and 0.86 on the validation set of 66 videos . Validation on children with an existing diagnosis limited the ability to generalize the performance to undiagnosed populations . <h> Conclusions <p> These results support the hypothesis that feature tagging of home videos for machine learning classification of autism can yield accurate outcomes in short time frames , using mobile devices .

All other authors have declared no competing interests exist . <h> Introduction <p> Neuropsychiatric disorders are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accounting for 14% of the global burden of disease 1 . A significant contributor to this metric is autism spectrum disorder ( ASD , or autism ) , which has risen in incidence by approximately 700% since 1996 2,3 and now impacts 1 in 59 children in the United States 4,5 . ASD is arguably one of the largest pediatric health challenges , as supporting an individual with the condition costs up to $2.4 million during his/her lifespan in the US 6 and over $5 billion annually in US healthcare costs 6 . <p> Like most mental health conditions , autism has a complex array of symptoms 7 that are diagnosed through behavioral exams . The standard of care ( SOC ) for an autism diagnosis uses behavioral instruments such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ( ADOS ) 8 and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised ( ADI-R ) 9 . These standard exams are similar to others in developmental pediatrics 10 in that they require a direct clinician-to-child observation and take hours to administer 11 -- 14 . The sharp rise in incidence of autism , coupled with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the healthcare system . Wait times for a diagnostic evaluation can reach or exceed 12 months in the US 15 , and the average age of diagnosis in the US remains near 5 years of age 2 , 13 , with underserved populations ' average age at ASD diagnosis as high as 8 years 16 -- 18 . The high variability in availability of diagnostic and therapeutic services is common to most psychiatry and mental health conditions across the US , with severe shortages of mental health services in 77% of US counties 19 . Behavioral interventions for ASD are most impactful when administered by or before 5 years of age 12,20 -- 23 ; however , the diagnostic bottleneck that families face severely limits the impact of therapeutic interventions . Scalable measures are necessary to alleviate these bottlenecks , reduce waiting times for access to therapy , and reach underserved populations in need . <p> As a step toward enabling fast and accurate access to care for ASD , we have used supervised machine learning approaches to identify minimal sets of behaviors that align with clinical diagnoses of ASD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the administration of the ADOS and ADI-R to train and test the accuracy of a range of classifiers . For the ADOS , we focused our analysis on ordinal outcome data from modules 1 , 2 , and 3 , which assess children with limited or no vocabulary , with phrased speech , and with fluent speech , respectively . Each of the 3 ADOS modules uses approximately 10 activities for a clinical observation of the child at risk and 28 -- 30 additional behavioral measurements used to score the child following the observation . Our machine learning analyses focused on archived records of the categorical and ordinal data generated from the scoring component of these ADOS examinations . Similarly , the ADI-R involves 93 multiple-choice questions asked by a clinician of the child 's primary care provider during an in-clinic interview ; as with the ADOS , we focused our classification task on the ordinal outcome data that resulted from the test 's administration . <p> These preliminary studies focused on building models optimized for accuracy , sparsity , and interpretability that differentiate autism from non-autism while managing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features , with performance at or no more than 1 standard error away from best test performance , and with interpretable outcomes -- for example , scores generated by a boosted decision tree or logistic regression ( LR ) approach . In all , these studies have used score data from 11,298 individuals with autism ( mixed with low- , medium- , and high-severity autism ) and 1,356 controls ( including some children for whom autism may have been suspected but was ruled out ) and have identified the following 8 classifiers : a 7-feature alternating decision tree ( ADTree7 ) 29 , an 8-feature alternating decision tree ( ADTree8 ) 30 , a 12-feature support vector machine ( SVM12 ) 26 , a 9-feature LR classifier ( LR9 ) 26 , a 5-feature support vector machine ( SVM5 ) 27 , a 5-feature LR classifier ( LR5 ) 27 , a 10-feature LR classifier ( LR10 ) 27 , and a 10-feature support vector machine ( SVM10 ) 27 . <p> Two of these 8 classifiers have been independently tested in 4 separate analyses . In a prospective head-to-head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the clinical evaluation and official diagnosis ) on 222 children ( NASD = 69 ; Ncontrols = 153 ; median age = 5.8 years ) , the performance , measured as the unweighted average recall ( UAR 31 ; the mean of the sensitivity and specificity ) , was 84.8% 24 . Separately , Bone and colleagues 32 tested the ADTree7 on a "" Balanced Independent Dataset "" ( BID ) consisting of ADI-R outcome data from 680 participants ( 462 ASD , mean age = 9.2 years , SD = 3.1 years ) and 218 non-ASD ( mean age = 9.4 years , SD = 2.9 years ) and found the performance to be similarly high at 80% . Duda and colleagues 25 tested the ADTree8 with 2,333 individuals with autism ( mean age = 5.8 years ) and 283 "" non-autism "" control individuals ( mean age = 6.4 years ) and found the performance to be 90.2% . Bone and colleagues 32 also tested this ADTree8 model in 1,033 participants from the BID -- 858 autism ( mean age = 5.2 years , SD = 3.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3.9 years , SD = 2.4 years ) , and 102 non-spectrum ( mean age = 3.4 years , SD = 2.0 years ) -- and found the performance to be slightly higher at 94% . These independent validation studies report classifier performance in the range of the published test accuracy and lend additional support to the hypothesis that models using minimal feature sets are reliable and accurate for autism detection . <p> Others have run similar training and testing experiments to identify top-ranked features from standard instrument data , including Bone 33 and Bussu 34 . These approaches have arrived at similar conclusions , namely that machine learning is an effective way to build objective , quantitative models with few features to distinguish mild- , medium- , and high-severity autism from children outside of the autism spectrum , including those with other developmental disorders . However , the translation of such models into clinical practice requires additional steps that have not yet been adequately addressed . Although some of our earlier work has shown that untrained video annotators can measure autism behaviors on home videos with high interrater reliability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken to move from minimal behavioral models into clinical practice remains . <p> The present study builds on this prior work to address this question and the hypothesis that features represented in our minimal viable classifiers can be labeled quickly , accurately , and reliably from short home videos by video raters with no official training in autism diagnosis or child development . We deployed crowdsourcing and real-time video analysis for feature labeling to run and evaluate the accuracy of the 8 machine learning models trained to detect autism in 2 independent home video repositories . This procedure enabled us to test the ability to reduce to practice the process of rapid mobile video analysis as a viable method for identifying autism symptoms and screening . In addition , as the mobile feature tagging of videos automatically generates a rich feature matrix , it presents the opportunity to train a new artificial intelligence model that has potentially higher generalizability to the task of automatic detection of autism in short video clips . We test this related hypothesis by constructing a novel video feature classifier and comparing its results to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature matrix and in an independent external validation set . The results from this work support the hypothesis that autism detection can be done from mobile devices outside of clinical settings with high efficiency and accuracy . <h> Methods <h> Source classifiers for reduce-to-practice testing <p> We assembled 8 published machine learning classifiers to test viability for use in the rapid mobile detection of autism in short home videos . For all of the 8 models , the source of training and validation data was medical records generated through the administration of one of two gold-standard instruments in the diagnosis of autism , the ADOS or the ADI-R . The ADOS has several modules containing approximately 30 features that correspond to developmental level of the individual under assessment . Module 1 is used on individuals with limited or no vocabulary . Module 2 is used on individuals who use phrase speech but who are not fluent . Module 3 is used on individuals who are fluent speakers . The ADI-R is a parent-directed interview that includes &gt;90 elements each asked of the parent , with multiple choices for answers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of either the ADOS and ADI-R and optimized for accuracy , sparsity of features , and interpretability . <p> For the purpose of brevity without omission of detail , we opted to create an abbreviation for each model using a basic naming convention . This abbreviation took the form of "" modeltype "" - "" number of features . "" For example , we used ADTree8 to refer to the use of an alternating decision tree ( ADTree ) with 8 features developed from medical data from the administration of the diagnostic instrument ADOS Module 1 , and LR5 to refer to the LR with 5 behavioral features developed from analysis of ADOS Module 2 medical record data , and so on . <h> ADTree7 . <p> We ( Wall and colleagues 29 ) applied machine learning to electronic medical record data recorded through the administration of the ADI-R in the diagnostic assessment of children at risk for autism . We used an 80%:20% training and testing split and performed 10-fold cross-validation for a sample of 891 children with autism and 75 non-autism control participants with an ADTree model containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imbalance 36,37 . We also performed up-sampling through 1,000 bootstrap permutations to manage class imbalance . The model was validated in a clinical trial on 222 participants 24 and in a BID consisting of 680 individuals ( 462 with autism ) 32 . The lowest sensitivity and specificity exhibited were 89.9 and 79.7 , respectively ( UAR = 84.8% ) . <h> ADTree8 . <p> We 30 used a dataset of score sheets from ADOS Module 2 for 612 children with ASD and 15 non-autism control participants with a 90%:10% training and testing split and 10-fold cross-validation to train and test an ADTree model with 8 of the 29 Module 2 features . The ADTree uses boosting and has inherent robustness to class imbalance 36,37 . We also performed up-sampling through 1,000 bootstrap permutations to test the sensitivity of model performance to class imbalance . This 8-feature ADTree model was independently tested on 446 individuals with autism by Wall and colleagues 30 , on 2,333 individuals with autism and 238 without autism by Duda and colleagues 25 , and on 1,033 individuals ( 858 autism , 73 autism spectrum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowest sensitivity and specificity reported were 97.1% and 83.3% , respectively ( UAR = 90.2% ) . <h> LR9 . <p> We 26 performed training with ADOS Module 2 records on 362 individuals with autism and 282 individuals without autism with backward feature selection and iterative removal of the single lowest-ranked feature across 10 folds each with a 90%:10% class split . Classes were weighted inversely proportional to class size to manage imbalance . The model with the highest sensitivity and specificity and lowest number of features , LR with L1 regularization and 9 features , was selected for testing . We tested the model on independent data from 1,089 individuals with autism and 66 individuals with no autism diagnosis . The lowest sensitivity and specificity identified were 98.8% and 89.4% , respectively ( UAR = 94.1% ) . <h> SVM12 . <p> We 26 used score sheets from ADOS Module 3 generated by the evaluation of 510 children with ASD and 93 non-ASD control participants . These data were split into a 90% training and 10% testing set . Training and parameter tuning were performed with stepwise backward feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 folds . Classes were weighted inversely proportional to class size to manage imbalance . Several models were fit to each of the feature cross-validation folds . The model with the highest sensitivity and specificity and lowest number of features , a Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) with a radial basis function , was then applied to the test set to measure generalization error . We tested the model on 1,924 individuals with autism and 214 individuals who did not qualify for an autism diagnosis . The lowest sensitivity and specificity identified on the test set were 97.7% and 97.2% , respectively ( UAR = 97.5% ) . <h> LR5 and SVM5 . <p> In this experiment , we 27 used medical records generated through the administration of ADOS Module 2 for 1,319 children with autism and 70 non-autism control participants . The dataset was split 80%:20% into train and test sets , with the same proportion for participants with and without ASD in each set . Class imbalance was managed by setting class weights inversely proportional to the class sizes . A 10-fold cross-validation was used to select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hyperparameter tuning prior to testing the performance . An SVM and an LR model with L1 regularization showed the highest test performance with 5 features . The lowest sensitivity and specificity exhibited on the test set for SVM5 were 98% and 58% , respectively , ( UAR = 78% ) and 93% and 67% , respectively , ( UAR = 80% ) for LR5 . <h> LR10 and SVM10 . <p> In this experiment , we 27 used medical records generated through the administration of ADOS Module 3 for 2,870 children with autism and 273 non-autism control participants . The dataset was split 80%:20% into train and test sets , with the same proportion for participants with and without ASD in each set . Class imbalance was managed by setting class weights inversely proportional to the class sizes . A 10-fold cross-validation was used to select features , and a separate 10-fold cross validation was run for hyperparameter tuning prior to testing the performance . An SVM and an LR model with L1 regularization showed the highest test performance with 10 features . The lowest sensitivity and specificity exhibited on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , respectively , ( UAR = 91% ) and 90% and 89% , respectively , ( UAR = 89.5% ) for LR10 . <p> Accounting for overlap in the features selected , these 8 models measure 23 unique features in total . The test accuracy for each model was &gt;90% . All models contain approximately 90% fewer questions than the ADI-R and 70% -- 84% fewer questions than the total features measured within the ADOS . An additional 7 features were chosen for their potential diagnostic value and scored by video raters to assess their suitability for scoring home videos , creating a total of 30 features for the mobile video rating process described below ( Fig 1 ) . <p> Video analysts scored each video with 30 features . This matrix shows which feature corresponds to which classifier . Darker colored features indicate higher overlap , and lighter colors indicate lower overlap across the models .

Participants were recruited via crowdsourcing methods 38 -- 41 targeted at social media platforms and listservs for families of children with autism . Interested participants were directed to a secure and encrypted video portal website to consent to participate . We required participants to be at least 18 years of age and the primary care provider(s) for a child with autism between the ages of 12 months and 17 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portal or via reference to a video already uploaded to YouTube together with age , diagnosis , and other salient characteristics . We considered videos eligible if they ( 1 ) were between 1 and 5 minutes in length , ( 2 ) showed the face and hands of the child , ( 3 ) showed clear opportunities for or direct social engagement , and ( 4 ) involved opportunities for the use of an object such as a utensil , crayon , or toy . <p> We relied on self-reported information provided by the parents concerning the child 's official diagnosis of autism or non-autism , the age of the child when the video was submitted , and additional demographic information for videos that were submitted directly to the web portal . For videos that were provided via YouTube URLs , we used YouTube metatags to confirm the age and diagnosis of the child in the video . If a video did not include a metatag for the age of the child in the video , the age was assigned following full agreement among the estimates made by 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parents ' self-report and to safeguard against reporting biases , we commissioned a practicing pediatric specialist certified to administer the ADOS to review a random selection of 20 videos . We also commissioned a developmental pediatrician to review a nonoverlapping random selection of 10 additional videos . These clinical experts classified each video as "" ASD "" or "" non-ASD . "" <h> Feature tagging of videos to run machine learning models <p> We employed a total of 9 video raters who were either students ( high school , undergraduate , or graduate-level ) or working professionals . None had training or certification for detection or diagnosis of autism . All were given instructions on how to tag the 30 questions and were asked to score 10 example videos before performing independent feature tagging of new videos . After training , we provided the raters with unique usernames and passwords to access the secure online portal to watch videos and answer 30 questions for each video needed by the feature vectors to run the 8 machine learning classifiers ( Table 1 ) . Features were presented to the video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level . The raters , who remained blind to diagnosis throughout the study , were tasked to choose one of the tags for each feature that best described the child 's behavior in the video . Each response to a feature was then mapped to a score between 0 and 3 , with higher scores indicating more severe autism features in the measured behavior , or 8 to indicate that the feature could not be scored . The behavioral features and the overlap across the models are provided in Fig 1 . <p> The models were constructed from an analysis of archived medical records from the use of standard instruments , including the ADOS and the ADI-R . All 8 models identified a small , stable subset of features in cross-validation experiments . The total numbers of affected and unaffected control participants for training and testing are provided together with measures of accuracy on the test set . Four models were tested on independent datasets and have been mentioned in a separate "" Test "" category . The remaining 4 , indicated with "" Train/test , "" used the given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 20% held-out test set . The naming convention of the classifiers is "" model type "" - "" number of features "" . <p> To test the viability of feature tagging videos for rapid machine learning detection and diagnosis of autism , we empirically identified a minimum number of video raters needed to score parent-provided home videos . We selected a random subset of videos from the full set of videos collected through our crowdsourced portal and ran the ADTree8 30 model on feature vectors tagged by all 9 raters . We chose to run only ADTree8 for efficiency reasons and because this model has been previously validated in 2 independent studies 25,32 . We used a sample-with-replacement permutation procedure to measure accuracy as a function of majority rater agreement with the true diagnostic classification . We incrementally increased the number of video raters per trial by 1 rater , starting with 1 and ending with 9 , drawing with replacement 1,000 times per trial . When considering only 2 raters , we required perfect class agreement between the raters . With an odd number of raters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of raters disagreed on classification , we used an independent and randomly chosen rater 's score to break the tie . <p> After determining the minimally viable number of video raters , we used that minimum to generate the full set of 30-feature vectors on all videos . Seven of the models were written in Python 3 using the package scikit-learn , and one was written in R. We ran these 8 models on our feature matrices after feature tagging on videos . We measured the model accuracy through comparison of the raters ' majority classification result with the true diagnosis . We evaluated model performance further by age categories : =2 years , &gt;2 to =4 years , &gt;4 years to =6 years , and &gt;6 years . For each category , we calculated accuracy , sensitivity , and specificity . <p> We collected timed data from each rater for each video , which began when a video rater pressed "" play "" on the video and concluded when a video rater finished scoring by clicking "" submit "" on the video portal . We used these time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We approximated the time taken to answer the questions by excluding the length of the video from the total time spent to score a video . <h> Building a video feature classifier <p> The process of video feature tagging provides an opportunity to generate a crowdsourced collection of independent feature measurements that are specific to the video of the child as well as independent rater impressions of that child 's behaviors . This in turn has the ability to generate a valuable feature matrix to develop models that include video-specific features rather than features identified through analysis on archived data generated through administration of the SOC ( as is the case for all classifiers contained in Table 1 ) . To this end , and following the completion of the annotation on all videos by the minimum number of raters , we performed machine learning on our video feature set . We used LR with an elastic net penalty 42 ( LR-EN-VF ) to predict the autism class from the non-autism class . We randomly split the dataset into training and testing , reserving 20% for the latter while using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We used cross-validation for model hyperparameter tuning by performing a grid search with different values of alpha ( varying penalty weights ) and L1 ratio ( the mixing parameter determining how much weight to apply to L1 versus L2 penalties ) . Based on the resulting area under the curve ( AUC ) and accuracy from each combination , we selected the top-performing pair of hyperparameters . Using this pair , we trained the model using LR and balanced class weights to adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data . After determining the top-ranked features based on the trained model and the resulting coefficients , we validated the model on the reserved test set . <h> Independent test set for validation of video phenotyping processes <p> We used our video portal and crowdsourcing approaches to generate an independent collection of videos for evaluation and feature tagging by 3 different raters than those used in the primary analysis . These raters had similar characteristics to the original group ( age , education , no clinical certifications in developmental pediatrics ) and were trained for video tagging through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was conducted under approval by Stanford University 's IRB under protocol IRB-31099"
"<h> 3 Advantages ( And 1 Disadvantage ) Of Edge Computing <p> By now , we 're all well used to cloud computing , and recognize the many ways in which cloud computing benefits businesses and makes our everyday lives easier . Could edge computing have a similar impact ? <p> https : //m.youtube.com/watch ? v=2EfbQGByq2I <p> Adobe Stock <p> What is edge computing ? <p> Edge computing refers to the processing of data on devices such as smartphones . Unlike in cloud computing , where the data is processed in remote , far-off data centers , edge computing gives devices the ability to carry out some or all of the data processing right then and there , at the point at which the data is collected . <p> This is all possible because devices are getting more and more powerful ( in part thanks to AI ) , meaning they can handle more data processing tasks . In other words , the device no longer has to send every little piece of data -- whether it 's useful or not -- to the cloud . <p> Think of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a night . Hours and hours of footage , with the vast majority of that footage showing empty corridors and rooms . Sending all of that data , which probably has little or no value , is a waste of bandwidth . But an AI-equipped security camera , which has the ability to analyze images right then and there , would be able to detect unusual activity and prioritize that data . <p> Key benefits of edge computing <p> Let 's look at the biggest advantages edge computing brings : <p> 1 . Saving bandwidth <p> The proliferation of smart devices means we 're creating an extraordinary amount of data . But not all of that data is critical . Revisiting our security camera example , if you have multiple cameras on a site , and each one is constantly streaming data to the cloud , then that 's using a lot of bandwidth for potentially not very useful data . But if the cameras are intelligent enough to process the data at its source , they can stream only the most important footage to the cloud , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another advantage of devices being able to sort critical data from the not-so-critical data is a reduction in latency ( i.e. , the time it takes to send data and receive a reply ) . With cloud computing , the device may be sending information to a data center on the other side of the world for processing , and this often results in a brief delay . This does n't always matter ; for example , most of us do n't mind that it typically takes Alexa a few seconds to reply to our question about today 's weather . <p> But that lag time is far less acceptable in the context of , say , a self-driving vehicle out on the road . If another car runs a stop sign , do you really want your autonomous vehicle to have to send that sensor and visual data to the cloud , then wait for a decision on what to do next ? Not so much . With edge computing , critical data -- data that 's absolutely vital to real-time decisions -- can be processed on the spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the quicker the response time , essentially . Meanwhile , the data that 's not so time-critical ( for example , fuel performance data ) can be sent to the cloud for later analysis . <p> 3 . Enhancing security and privacy <p> Edge computing reduces the amount of data that has to travel over a network , which is an obvious bonus from a security perspective . There 's also the fact that data is distributed ( in this case , located on multiple user devices ) as opposed to being stored in one place . This is all good news , providing manufacturers of smart products make securing that local data a key priority . <p> What about privacy ? In theory , with less data being uploaded to the cloud and more data being processed on the device , users of smart devices will have greater control over their data . Imagine , if your Amazon Echo speaker is able to process and respond to your weather forecast request without that data being sent to a central Amazon server , then that 's one less bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea , anyway . In reality , companies are unlikely to give up their vice-like grip on something as valuable as user data . But as edge computing evolves , we may ( if we 're lucky ) see more options for opting out of sending our data to the cloud . <p> A potential pitfall to be aware of <p> That 's the positives taken care of . What about the negatives ? In my mind , there 's one potential downside to edge computing : namely , that important data could end up being overlooked and discarded in the quest to save bandwidth and reduce latency . <p> Data that is n't vital for real-time decisions may have other uses . For example , if an autonomous vehicle is traveling along an otherwise empty road , it may seem like that visual and sensor data is pointless . What can be learned from an empty road ? Quite a lot , potentially . That seemingly useless data could still provide information on road conditions and how the vehicle behaves under those conditions -- and this can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . A balance is needed between maximizing the opportunities provided by edge computing while still recognizing the value of data . <p> Bernard Marr is an internationally best-selling author , popular keynote speaker , futurist , and a strategic business &amp; technology advisor to governments and companies .

Why would anyone pay tens of thousands of dollars for an education at a mid-tier college when they could learn from Ivy League professors online for free ( or , at least , for cheap ) ? Udacity 's Sebastian Thrun , a brilliant Stanford computer scientist , recently predicted that within 50 years there will be only 10 universities remaining in the world . He hopes Udacity will be one of them . <p> Advertisement <p> But Coursera has opted to work with existing institutions rather than compete with them . Andrew Ng , who co-founded Coursera with his Stanford colleague Daphne Koller , insists that their firm is meant to complement , not supplant , the traditional college experience . "" Online education is absolutely not a replacement for the high-quality education that a top university can give , "" Ng says . "" Why do people pay $50,000 a year to attend an institution like one of Coursera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real value of a Caltech education is n't just the content . Content is increasingly available for free on the Web . The real value is the interactions with professors and other , equally bright students . "" <p> Coursera , Ng says , is about expanding access to the content , if not the full experience . Driven by ever-broader demand , higher education costs have soared in the past two decades , leaving even middle-class families struggling to afford college . Those who can afford a place like Caltech , and who get in , probably are n't going to abandon that opportunity in favor of an online education . It 's those students who ca n't , or do n't , who will avail themselves of the school 's online offerings . Just as important , the a la carte menu of classes will draw in loads of people who are n't full-time students and who do n't have the time or money to enroll in formal continuing education programs . People like Chris Wilson , who took Ng 's machine learning class online last fall and blogged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Coursera is rather inspiring when you consider that its online classes have thus far not counted for real credit at any of the participating schools . Learning , not r ? sum ? padding , has been the motivating force . The startup 's popularity has in turn attracted heavyweight investors like Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers , even though Coursera has yet to make any money . Possible revenue sources in the future include charging students for certificates , charging employers for access to top students , and offering more classes for real college credit . <p> The real question about Coursera 's model has been whether top universities would buy in . Some critics doubted that top-tier institutions would willingly give away a product for which they now charge hundreds of thousands of dollars . Coursera 's new partnerships provide an emphatic answer . But what 's the explanation -- why have Johns Hopkins , UCSF , the University of Toronto , and the University of Edinburgh , among others , signed on so eagerly ? <p> Classroom flipping means assigning lectures as homework , leaving actual classroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me his class at Stanford is already doing this , and he 's encouraging other professors to adopt the approach for their Coursera classes as well . <p> When you think about classroom flipping , Coursera videos start to look less like a dubious replacement for the college experience . Instead , they 're more like a welcome replacement for another product : textbooks . <p> Ng says that 's not a bad analogy . "" I 've actually had several professors tell me they were previously thinking of writing a new textbook , and they decided instead to teach an online course on Coursera , "" he says . "" It turns out to be less work , and your reach is likely greater . Not to mention that it 's so much more interactive . I certainly think students learn better by taking an online course than by reading a textbook . "" <p> Textbooks , of course , have always offered motivated outsiders access to famous professors ' pedagogy at a sliver of the price of college tuition . It 's just that they 're too dense and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the line . Online classes have the potential to solve that problem . <p> By democratizing Ivy League-level lectures , Coursera and its cohorts will force the nation 's colleges to prove their value in other ways . That can only be a good thing for students -- and their cash-strapped parents ."
