"<p> Scientists have several times noticed flashes of light that appear on the moon , and experts still remain clueless about this weird phenomenon . Sometimes , very short flashes appeared on the lunar surface , and in some other cases , this mysterious light phenomenon on earth 's natural satellite lasted longer . Researchers also noted some areas where places used to get darkened temporarily . <p> Scientists believe that meteor impacts on the lunar surface might have created these short flashes , while some others claim that the reaction of electrically charged particles with the solar wind might be causing these light phenomenon . <p> Even though modern science is yet to give a convincing explanation about this mysterious phenomenon , a team of German scientists has put forward a different theory that could provide valuable information to humans who plan to build a permanent lunar base in the near future . <p> "" Seismic activities were also observed on the moon . When the surface moves , gases that reflect sunlight could escape from the interior of the moon . This would explain the luminous phenomena , some of which last for hours , "" said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t ( JMU ) W ? rzburg in Germany in a recently issued statement . <p> During the research , astronomers set up a telescope which will use artificial intelligence to automatically detect the flashes on the lunar surface . As the burst of light appears on the lunar surface , the telescope will automatically collect photos and videos of the phenomenon , and it will help scientists to learn more about this visual spectacle . <p> "" The so-called transient lunar phenomena have been known since the 1950s , but they have not been sufficiently observed . There are simply better weather conditions for observing the moon than in Germany , "" added Kayal . <p> A few weeks back , another study report published in the journal Nature Geoscience had revealed that the moon is slowly shrinking , and it is causing wrinkles in the crust of the moon . As per experts , this shrinking is also causing moonquakes on earth 's natural satellites ."

"<h> Up next <h> Author <h> Share article <p> During the company 's Platforms State of the Union event at its Worldwide Developers Conference ( WWDC ) , Apple announced that it is building up a new tool named Real User Indicator that could cut down number of bots signing up for new accounts with mobile , desktops etc. secretively . The feature checks for traits more consistent with the bots than people and therefore , informs an app developer of the situation so that the developer can take further necessary action to verify the authenticity . <p> "" It uses on-device intelligence to determine if the originating device is behaving in a normal way . The device generates a value without sending any specifics to Apple , "" an Apple spokesperson explained onstage during the event . The value is then "" boiled down to a single value shared with your app at account setup time , "" and "" depending on the value you receive , you can be confident your user is a real user or get a notice you should take a second look . "" <p> However it is not clear how this value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inputted information due to concerns regarding data privacy . There are few possibilities . On-device intelligence may mean Apple is monitoring how fast certain particulars are filled during the signing-up of new account , something that would indicate an automated process is behind the new account . Apple could look at factors like the speed of account verification via email , or even analyze typed-out information for the name or address particulars of the sign-up process . <p> Regardless of how exactly it works , the Real User Indicator could make a big impact on the number of bot accounts escalating across the internet . If it functions as per the design and is in fact a strong indicator of fraudulent or suspicious digital behavior , we could see fake activity , prevalent in every corner of online life , being curbed . <p> As already noticed , Captcha getting better and better , all thanks to advances in artificial intelligence that has rendered simple bot test obsolete . However , the bot account will get undetected if the developer is unable to put those designed tests in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York Magazine 's Max Read last December , Read made an argument that we are approaching or have passed an event called ' The Inversion ' in which largest tech companies will mistake a real activity to be a fake one and a bot activity for the real deal due to the reason that most activities like page views , video views , tweets , retweets , comments and many more come from bots rather than people . <p> Many big companies like Facebook and Twitter already have internal AI-powered systems designed for crushing bots and stopping automated account creation and these system have been improving . For instance , Facebook has removed 2.2 billion fake accounts between January and March , majority of the accounts being caught by the company 's automated fraud systems before the accounts went live . <p> Facebook suggests that the bot growth is accelerating due to number of factors ranging from the frequency and effectiveness of election interference and misinformation to the scores of illicit bot farms designed to juice analytics and sell fake marketing success . <p> It is uncertain if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect on detecting fake activity .

The Andamans once had other similar groups , long-ago migrants from Africa and Southeast Asia who settled in the island chain , but their numbers have dwindled dramatically over the past century as a result of disease , intermarriage and migration . <p> Chau estimated there were about 250 inhabitants on the island , with at least 10 people living in each hut . <p> "" The tribe 's language has a lot of high pitched sounds like ba , pa la and as , "" he wrote . <p> It 's not clear what happened to Chau when he swam back to the island the next morning .

And it was yet another show of how Trump has dramatically transformed the presidency , erasing the traditional divisions between domestic policy and military matters and efforts to keep the troops clear of politics . <p> "" You probably see over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "" Trump told one Air Force brigadier general stationed at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan , adding : "" I do n't have to even ask you . I know what you want to do , you want to make sure that you know who we 're letting in . "" <p> Later , Trump asked a U.S. Coast Guard commander about trade , which he noted was "" a very big subject "" for him personally . <p> "" We 've been taken advantage of for many , many years by bad trade deals , "" Trump told the commander , who sheepishly replied that , "" We do n't see any issues in terms of trade right now . "" <p> And throughout , Trump was sure to congratulate himself , telling the officers that the country is doing exceptionally well on his watch . <p> "" I hope that you 'll take solace in knowing that all of the American families you hold so close to your heart are all doing well , "" he said . "" The nation 's doing well economically , better than anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody 's done more for the military than me . "" <p> Indeed , asked what he was thankful for this Thanksgiving , Trump cited his "" great family , "" as well as himself . <p> "" I made a tremendous difference in this country , "" he said . <p> But Trump continued to warn about the situation on the southern border as he took questions from reporters , pointing to the caravans of Central American migrants that have been making their way toward the U.S. and warning that , "" If we find that it gets to a level where we lose control or people are going to start getting hurt , we 're going to close entry into the country for a period of time until we get it under control . "" <p> He said he had the authority to do so by executive order and claimed he 'd already used it earlier this week . "" Two days ago , we closed the border . We actually just closed it , said nobody 's coming in because it was just out of control . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mexico . Officials did shut down one port of entry , San Ysidro , in California , for several hours early Monday morning to bolster security because of concerns about a potential influx of migrant caravan members . They closed northbound lanes into the U.S. and reopened most of them before the morning rush . <p> Trump 's border threat came days after a federal judge put the administration 's attempts to overhaul asylum rules on hold . Courts have also blocked several versions of the president 's travel ban as well as his attempt to end a program that allows young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children to live and work in the country . <p> Trump probably could close the entire southern border by order , at least temporarily , invoking national security powers . But doing so could cause extraordinary damage to bilateral relations as well as to cross-border commerce between the U.S. and Mexico , its third largest trading partner . It would not necessarily stop migrants from coming either ; Trump would have to contend with the same asylum laws already vexing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Friday apologized for the sickness and deaths of some of its workers , saying it failed to create a safe working environment at its computer chip and display factories . <p> The announcement by the South Korean technology giant came weeks after the company and a group representing ailing Samsung workers agreed to accept compensation terms suggested by a mediator and end a highly-publicized standoff that went on for more than a decade . The company 's apology was part of the settlement . <p> Kinam Kim , president of Samsung 's device solutions division , said the company failed to "" sufficiently manage health threats "" at its semiconductor and liquid crystal display manufacturing lines . Dozens of employees who worked there have experienced grave illnesses such as leukemia and brain tumour . <p> "" We offer our sincere apology to our workers who have suffered with illnesses and their families , "" Kim said during a news conference in Seoul , which was also attended by activists and relatives of the workers . <p> The standoff began in 2007 when taxi driver Hwang Sang-gi refused to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working at a Samsung factory . Hwang 's efforts to clarify the cause of Yu-mi 's death and hold Samsung responsible for problems related to working conditions galvanized a broader movement to hold businesses and the government accountable for safety lapses in the chip and display industries , which use huge amounts of chemicals . <p> "" No apology would be enough when considering the deception and humiliation we experienced ( from Samsung ) over the past 11 years , the pain of suffering from occupational diseases , the pain of losing loved ones , "" Hwang said at the news conference . "" But I take today 's apology as a promise from Samsung Electronics , "" to improve the safety of its workplaces , he said . <p> According to the settlement , Samsung will compensate for various illnesses of employees who have worked at its chip and LCD factories since 1984 , including as much as 150 million won ( $132,000 ) for leukemia . The compensation also covers miscarriages and congenital illnesses of the workers ' children such as child cancer . <p> But while cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lapses in safety standards , Samsung has yet to fully acknowledge its workplace environment as the direct cause of the illnesses . <p> Mexican immigration agents on Wednesday detained almost all of the Central American migrants on a fourth caravan that recently entered Mexico seeking to reach the United States . <p> Mexico 's National Immigration Institute said 213 migrants were detained and taken to a processing centre . Those found to lack proper documents may face repatriation to their home countries . <p> The migrants detained on a highway between the Guatemalan border and the southern Mexican city of Tapachula included 186 people from El Salvador , 16 from Guatemala , 10 Honduras and one Nicaraguan . <p> The group set out from El Salvador on Nov. 18 and apparently crossed the river dividing Guatemala and Mexico on Tuesday . That is the same route the three larger caravans took after entering Mexico starting Oct. 19 . <p> The caravans find strength in numbers , and Mexican officials have been loath to confront the first caravans , which numbered between 1,500 and 6,000 . But agents have detained smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico has offered residency and other types of visas to migrants in the caravans , but most have refused , saying they want to reach the United States . <p> Also Wednesday , prosecutors in the northern state of Baja California -- where the first caravan is now camped out -- confirmed that a migrant was run over and killed by an unidentified vehicle on a highway between the border cities of Mexicali and Tijuana . <p> The state prosecutor 's office said 17-year-old Oscar Baudiel Cruz Alcerro , of Honduras was found dead on the roadside with fractures and a dented skull , with parts from a white car scattered nearby . <p> Migrants stranded in Mexicali have been walking and hitching rides to join up with the main part of the caravan in Tijuana , about 180 kilometres to the west . <p> At least one other migrant was killed early in the caravan when he fell off a truck on a highway in the southern state of Chiapas . <p> A car plowed into a crowd of children outside a primary school in northeastern China on Thursday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government spokesman said . <p> The driver was taken into custody after the crash around noon in the coastal city of Huludao in Liaoning province , said the spokesman for Jianchang county in the city 's suburbs , who declined to give his name as is standard with Chinese bureaucrats . <p> He described the crash as "" a major traffic accident "" and said the cause was under investigation . <p> State broadcaster CCTV reported all five dead and all but two of the injured were children . <p> Security camera footage showed a line of children crossing the street in front of their school when a car approaches , which then changes lanes and swerves into the crowd of children . <p> It was n't clear if the crash was a deliberate attack or whether the driver was swerving to avoid obstacles in front of him . <p> Wang Mingkuan , a cook at a nearby noodle restaurant , said he was making meals when the crash occurred . <p> "" I ran out and saw about a dozen children lying on the ground , some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two or three showed no signs of life , "" Wang told The Associated Press by telephone . <p> Wang said ambulances and police cars rushed to the scene and officers blocked off the area and prevented people from filming . He said that rumours about the driver included that he was drunk , fleeing police or had deliberately targeted the children . <p> The Los Angeles district attorney declined to prosecute attorney Michael Avenatti on felony domestic abuse charges on Wednesday and referred allegations that he roughed up his girlfriend to the city attorney for a possible misdemeanour case . <p> Avenatti , 47 , was arrested on suspicion of felony domestic violence last week after his girlfriend told police he abused her at his Los Angeles apartment following an argument . <p> A restraining order against Avenatti was issued after actress Mareli Miniutti said he dragged her by the arm across a bedroom floor . <p> Avenatti , who had called the allegations "" completely false "" and a fabrication , said in a statement he was thankful the district attorney had rejected the charges and was "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am completely innocent . I have absolute faith in the system that I will be fully exonerated , "" Avenatti told The Associated Press . "" This whole thing is bogus . "" <p> A spokeswoman for the district attorney would not say why prosecutors declined to take the case from Los Angeles police . Documents supporting the decision were not released because the case was referred to the city attorney and was still under investigation . <p> The city attorney 's office will review the case , a spokesman said . <p> Avenatti , who is mulling a presidential run , is best known as the attorney for porn actress Stormy Daniels , who has said she had an affair with President Donald Trump in 2006 , a claim Trump denies . <p> As Daniels ' lawyer , Avenatti has pursued the president and those close to him relentlessly for months , taunting Trump in interviews and baiting him and his lawyers in tweets."
"<p> Bayelsa State Governor Seriake Dickson has urged the people to reject the ticket of the All Progressives Congress ( APC ) in the November 16 gubernatorial election . <p> He asked the leader of the All Progressives Congress and Minister of State for Petroleum Resources , Chief Timipre Sylva , to apologise to Bayelsans for presenting an unelectable ticket of cultists and militants to the people . <p> A statement by his Chief Press Secretary , Fidelis Soriwei , quoted the governor as having made the call at the official opening of the PDP Governorship Campaign Office/Secretariat in Yenagoa yesterday . <p> Commercial activities were brought to a halt along the busy Melford Okilo Road , with the capital city on a lockdown for hours , as the rally attracted a mammoth crowd from across the eight local governments . <p> Dickson said the coming poll was not only about Senator Douye Diri , the PDP standard-bearer , but about the future of the state and Ijaw nation as a whole . <p> He said the APC has nothing to offer the people and indeed the Ijaw nation as shown by the fact that the party , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure to the state . <p> The governor said that the APC had only succeeded in promoting insecurity and instability in the communities of Bayelsa such as the sacking of Peremabiri in Southern Ijaw Local Government and Bassambiri in Nembe Local Government . <p> Said he : "" The election is not about me , but about the future of the state .

"<p> As machines enabled by technologies are increasingly becoming commonplace , work by humans are expected to become more versatile and creative . The reasoning is humans -- at least the ingenious set -- have always shown a willingness to adapt and innovate to new situations . But how will the relationship between humans and machines play out ? <p> The following is excerpted from a new book published by Harper Collins titled The Future Ready Organization : How Dynamic Capability Management Is Reshaping The Modern Workplace by Gyan Nagpal . The book offers some interesting insights on the subject . <p> --- <p> The very nature of dynamic capability thinking is collaborative . Taking it one step beyond human capability involves embracing both human and automated contributions . A principal reason that a vibrant gig economy even exists today is due to web-enabled communication and collaboration . The same is true for outsourcing too . The entire industry for transnational services outsourcing grew from a standing start in 1990 due to advances in telephony , software and data mobility . It stands to reason that this trend will continue and with it the reshaping of human contribution by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human capability within the dynamic capability framework , there are five that will be totally reshaped by technology over the next ten years . These are given in the next illustration ( fig. 7.2 ) . <p> We know this because in each of them , the core disruptive triggers are already in motion . Let 's examine eight predictions of how the human -- machine partnership can reshape how we organize work over the coming decade . <p> Machines will dominate repetitive and rule-based work . Humans will shine at creative and non-linear pursuits . <p> Key technology : Robotic Process Automation ( RPA ) <p> RPA generally refers to the automation of rule-based and algorithmic work using software . By and large , these robots are dumb -- they must be programmed , turned on and provided with instructions . Still , RPA has the potential to totally transform the transactional outsourcing industry by 2030 . One level above RPA sits Intelligent Process Automation ( IPA ) , which while still rules-based , now involves a level of machine learning or ' intelligence ' . This could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or maybe even a human , for additional information . <p> Intelligent Machines will raise human intellect and productivity to new levels . <p> Key technology : Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) <p> Experimental AI programs like AlphaGo have already demonstrated how programs can learn complex games to eventually outperform the best human champions . It came to a head in 1997 , when the Deep Blue computer beat the world champion Gary Kasparov at chess . We are discovering AI 's potential by the day . Recently , an improved version of AlphaGo , AlphaGo Zero , took just three days to learn the complex Go game from scratch and beat its predecessor 100 games to zero . These events have provided new impetus and learning directions for both game designers and players . In other words , machines can teach us to go beyond presently known boundaries of human potential . Go players are already relearning a thousand-year-old game according to Alphago Zero 's patterns of play . <p> As opposed to dumb robots , AI relies on a level of machine learning which makes the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by mimicking a neural network , processing options and the consequences of those options . This is what Simon believed AI 's true potential to be . Could AI programs one day be seen as a source for human learning -- with an ultimate aim to improve human decision-making and eventually the human mind itself ? <p> Machines will program directly for us . <p> Key technology : Natural Language Processing <p> Laboratory programs today can already recognise handwriting almost as well as humans do and describe the contents of pictures , diagrams and schematics at astonishing levels of detail . The key tipping point seems to be in natural language processing , which allows software to understand and interpret human speech in multiple languages , an advance which could allow computers to write code one day and lead to the complete obsolescence of programming languages such as Java . <p> The human cloud will exist within a much larger mechanical cloud . <p> Key technology : Natural Language Generation <p> The next step to Natural Language Processing is Natural Language Generation , or a machine 's ability to interpret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that automation starts to overlap with traditional white-collar jobs , such as journalism or data analytics . A very good example is Quill , a program which writes journalistic style commentary based on underlying data . Developed by Chicago-based Narrative Science , Quill is already writing up 10 -- 15 page reports for regulators and investors at companies like Credit Suisse and T. Rowe Price . Think of the implications in live sportscasting and security intelligence . It should n't surprise us that one of the investors in Quill is the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) . <p> When Natural Language Generation merges with other areas of cognitive computing , such as pattern recognition or self-learning systems , the future potential is unmistakable . With massive gigabytes of data available to analyse or visualise , and an internet of things ( IoT ) revolution on the horizon , I can imagine programs such as Quill will one day have a seat at the boardroom table , for the immediate analytical insight they can provide . <p> Management spans-of-control will exceed a hundred times . <p> Key Technology : Smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as radically widen management impact , through the automation of old supervisory tasks like review and reporting . This frees up managerial time and also promotes greater autonomy and sense of self-direction for employees . <p> Once a project is scoped and agreed upon , smart agents can easily take on the task of scheduling project deadlines , aligning priorities , dependencies , communicating critical reminders and even handling escalations independently . Management can be much more interventional as a consequence and oriented towards real value-added behaviour like problem-solving and coaching for outcomes . <p> Applications will fade to the background and be replaced by digital assistants . <p> Key Technology : In-App and Mobile Searches , Smart Agents and Chatbots <p> Across industry today , it is common to drive the use of self- service applications . This augers well for customers but can also lead to a huge cluttering of applications . Smartphone users ' app downloads number close to 185 billion a year -- each fulfilling a narrow purpose . This can be overwhelming . Most of us like how Google searches and catalogues the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same way . They resemble independent books on a shelf rather than a seamless web . Industry experts now suggest that Search engines could soon have the power to crawl through , parse and index data stored within an app . This makes the app itself obsolete . Once this happens , content could potentially reach the smart agent directly , without the user ever needing to download the app itself . This will result in both simplification and speed . Instead of hundreds of enterprise applications to trawl through , more and more functions will make their data compatible with virtual digital assistants , operated by voice commands and designed to meet the needs of customers or even a specific type of talent , for example , a new hire , a virtual worker operating from home , a salesperson , short-term contractor or a manager supporting a mix of internal and external talent . <p> In Singapore , DBS Bank 's Digibank chatbot that operates across a variety of platforms including Facebook messenger , claims to resolve 82 per cent of all queries without human assistance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million in-home loan leads via its chatbot Emma . Similarly , the top insurance companies are using chatbots to help their agents and financial advisors resolve client queries in real time . Customer information on claims , past premium histories or policy values are all available through what is now seen as a virtual sales assistant . <p> Learning becomes practical , customised and just-in-time. ? <p> Key technologies : Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality <p> Virtual Reality ( VR ) based immersive simulations have already started changing the way we learn . For example , Oculus VirtualSpeech helps improve public speaking skills by mimicking live stage experiences with responsive virtual audiences . <p> Augmented Reality ( AR ) is the next step , which involves superimposing data or images upon what we see in real life . For example , imagine workers repairing complex machinery in a remote location being able to superimpose step-by-step schematics or training manuals on the machine itself . The implications of AR all the way from school classrooms to operation theatres in hospitals can save both time and lives through just-in-time learning . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Technology : Intelligent wearables <p> In an Internet of Things ( IoT ) environment , intelligent wearables are often the smartest safety investment that companies can make , particularly in high-risk work environments . For example , Australia-based SmartCap Technologies has developed a solution which can constantly monitor operators of heavy machinery , like truck drivers , for micro-sleeps and other signs of fatigue . Similarly , wearable proximity alarm systems can help workers stay away from danger or prevent mishaps on locations as diverse as oil rigs , ship decks , underground mines and high-rise construction sites . <p> In conclusion , the potential for collaboration between human capability and intelligent machines is limitless and if used correctly , can transform the impact of both people and the organisations they work for . It is important that we do n't see intelligent machines as the enemy , but recognise that human frailties , like our propensity to satisfice and our desire for creativity over tedium , are the real reason we need them . <p> The excerpts have been published with permission from HarperCollins Publishers India . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the world is n't waiting for it and neither are UK and India , said Lord Mayor of London Peter Estlin as he tried to assure Indian investors about the growing strength of the UK 's financial technology sector . <p> Speaking exclusively to CNBC-TV18 the Lord Mayor said , "" Brexit has been frustrating as it is masking the sheer scale of innovation taking place in the UK .

"<h> San Francisco bans government use of facial-recognition technology <h> Share this : <h> San Francisco bans government use of facial-recognition technology <p> File Image ( Photo By Getty Images ) <p> SAN FRANCISCO , Calif. -- San Francisco , long one of the most tech-friendly and tech-savvy cities in the world , is now the first in the United States to prohibit its government from using facial-recognition technology . <p> The ban is part of a broader anti-surveillance ordinance that the city 's Board of Supervisors approved on Tuesday . Eight of the board 's 11 supervisors voted in favor of it . The ordinance , which outlaws the use of facial-recognition technology by police and other government departments , could also spur other local governments to take similar action . <p> Facial-recognition systems are increasingly used everywhere from police departments to rock concerts to homes , stores and schools . They are designed to identify specific people from live video feeds , recorded video footage or still photos , often by comparing their features with a set of faces ( such as mugshots ) . <p> San Francisco 's new rule , which is set to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facial-recognition technology by the city 's 53 departments -- including the San Francisco Police Department , which does n't currently use such technology but did test it out between 2013 and 2017 . However , the ordinance carves out an exception for federally controlled facilities at San Francisco International Airport and the Port of San Francisco . The ordinance does n't prevent businesses or residents from using facial recognition or surveillance technology in general -- such as on their own security cameras . And it also does n't do anything to limit police from , say , using footage from a person 's Nest camera to assist in a criminal case . <p> "" We all support good policing but none of us want to live in a police state , "" San Francisco Supervisor Aaron Peskin , who introduced the bill earlier this year , told CNN Business ahead of the vote . <p> The ordinance adds yet more fuel to the fire blazing around facial-recognition technology . While the technology grows in popularity , it has come under increased scrutiny as concerns mount regarding its deployment , accuracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to train the systems . <p> In San Francisco , Peskin is concerned that the technology is "" so fundamentally invasive "" that it should n't be used . <p> "" I think San Francisco has a responsibility to speak up on things that are affecting the entire globe , that are happening in our front yard , "" he said . <h> Early days for facial recognition laws <p> Facial recognition has improved dramatically in recent years due to the popularity of a powerful form of machine learning called deep learning . In a typical system , facial features are analyzed and then compared with labeled faces in a database . <p> Yet AI researchers and civil rights groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union are particularly concerned about accuracy and bias in facial-recognition systems . There are concerns that they are not as effective at correctly recognizing people of color and women . One reason for this issue is that the datasets used to train the software may be disproportionately male and white . <p> The ACLU is one of many civil-rights groups supporting the ordinance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the ACLU of Northern California , said the raft of issues posed by facial-recognition systems mean the city 's legislation would prevent harm to community members . He also expects that the rule will prompt other cities to follow suit . <p> "" We should be able to live our lives without every movement of ours being tracked and monitored by the government , "" he told CNN Business in advance of the vote . <p> There are currently no federal laws addressing how artificial-intelligence technology in general , or facial-recognition systems specifically , can be used , though a Senate bill introduced in March would force companies to get consent from consumers before collecting and sharing identifying data . <p> A few states and local governments have made their own efforts : Illinois , for example , has a law that requires companies get consent from customers before collecting biometric information . California 's senate is currently considering a bill that would ban police in the state from using biometric technology -- such as facial recognition -- with body-camera footage . <p> In the Bay Area alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( of which Palo Alto is a part ) have passed their own surveillance-technology laws . Oakland is also currently considering whether to ban the use of facial-recognition technology . <h> How surveillance could be harder in San Francisco <p> Under the new San Francisco law , any city department that wants to use surveillance technology or services ( such as the police department if it were interested in buying new license-plate readers , for example ) must first get approval from the Board of Supervisors . That process will include submitting information about the technology and how it will be used , and presenting it at a public hearing . With the new rule , any city department that already uses surveillance tech will need to tell the board how it is being used . <p> "" This ordinance is really about making sure that , when there are surveillance programs , the community has a voice and a seat at the table , "" Cagle said . <p> The ordinance also states that the city will need to report to the Board of Supervisors each year on whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which they were approved , and include details like what data was kept , shared or erased . <p> In a statement ahead of the vote , the San Francisco Police Department said it "" looks forward "" to working with the city 's supervisors , the ACLU , and others to develop laws that speak to tech-related privacy worries "" while balancing the public safety concerns of our growing , international city . "" <p> "" In accordance with the legislation , we are in the process of auditing our technologies and related policies , "" the statement said . <h> The vocal opposition <p> Some locals have been vocally opposed to the surveillance ordinance , including several groups of residents . Frank Noto , president of Stop Crime SF , a group focused on crime prevention , said prior to the vote that his organization recognizes privacy and civil-liberties concerns that may have prompted the ordinance 's introduction , but sees it as flawed legislation largely because it requires the police department to get approval from the city for existing surveillance technology . <p> And while Stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's also concerned about prohibiting its use entirely . Noto suggested a moratorium on using it -- say , for two years -- might be a better option ."
"<h> MIT develops system that can detect 85% of cyberattacks using artificial intelligence <p> MIT has developed a new artificially intelligent system that can predict 85% of cyberattacks to ease the load for cybersecurity analysts.iStock <p> Computer scientists from the Michigan Institute of Technology ( MIT ) and a machine learning startup , PatternEx , have reportedly developed a new system that can correctly detect 85% of cyberattacks using artificial intelligence merged with input from human experts . <p> At the moment , security systems are closely monitored by humans and programmed to pick up on cyberattacks that only follow very specific rules , as such missing any attacks that do not follow those rules . <p> But , there are also systems autonomously run by computers that practice anomaly detection -- i.e. the identification of items , events or observations -- that do not conform to an expected pattern or other items in a dataset . This method often leads to false positives , meaning that humans doubt the reliability of the system and are forced to go back and check all the results anyway . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory ( CSAIL ) , in collaboration with PatternEx , have developed the AI2 artificial intelligent platform , which merges three different machine learning methods that enable computers to learn unsupervised . <p> Rather than requiring cybersecurity analysts to spend all day analysing huge amounts of data that may or may not be a sign that cybercriminals are attacking a network , AI2 is instead trained to pick out the 200 most abnormal events it has detected during that day . <p> The human expert looks at the events and picks out which events relate to a cyberattack , and as days pass by , the computer learns how to identify more and more of the events as attacks , accurately , by itself -- meaning that , eventually , the cybersecurity analyst might only need to look at 30-40 flagged events per day . <p> "" You can think about the system as a virtual analyst , "" said Kalyan Veeramachaneni , a research scientist at CSAIL who developed AI2 with Ignacio Arnaldo , a chief data scientist at PatternEx and a former CSAIL postdoc . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in as little as a few hours , meaning it can improve its detection rates significantly and rapidly . "" <p> When tested using 3.6 billion pieces of data called "" log lines "" that were generated by millions of users over three months , AI2 was able to correctly identify cyberattacks roughly about three times better than previous systems , while also reducing the number of false positive results by a factor of five . <p> "" The more attacks the system detects , the more analyst feedback it receives , which , in turn , improves the accuracy of future predictions , "" said Veeramachaneni .

"<h> Top trends shaping analytics and BI <p> Oct 7 , 2019 <p> The latest research from Gartner reveals the five major trends that are shaping the evolution of analytics and business intelligence ( BI ) . "" As intelligence is at the core of all digital businesses , IT and business leaders continue to make analytics and BI their top innovation investment priority , "" says Jim Hare , research vice-president at Gartner . "" This Hype Cycle helps data and analytics leaders make the transition to augmented analytics , to build a digital culture and operationalising and scaling analytics initiatives . "" <p> Hype Cycle for Analytics and Business Intelligence , 2019 <p> The five key trends are : 1 . Augmented Analytics Augmented analytics uses machine learning to automate data preparation , insight discovery , data science , and machine learning model development and insight sharing for a broad range of business users , operational workers and citizen data scientists . As it matures , augmented analytics will become a key feature of modern analytics platforms . It will deliver analysis to everyone in an organisation in less time , with less of a requirement for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manual approaches . As the technology develops , there will be more citizen data scientists . Gartner predicts that , by 2020 , citizen data scientists will surpass data scientists in the amount of advanced analysis they produce , largely due to the automation of data science tasks . 2 . Digital Culture Developing an effective digital culture may be the first and most important step an organisation takes in its digital transformation journey . "" Data literacy , digital ethics , privacy , enterprise and vendor data-for-good initiatives encompass digital culture , "" says Hare . Any organisation that aims to derive value from data and is on its journey towards digital transformation must focus on developing data literacy . Gartner analysts expect data literacy to impact all employees by becoming not just a business skill , but a critical life skill . Concerned by the rise of artificial intelligence ( AI ) , digital society and "" fake news , "" individuals , organisations and governments are increasingly interested in digital ethics . Data and analytics ( D&amp;A ) leaders should sponsor discussions about digital ethics to ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trust of employees , customers and partners . Gartner predicts that , by 2023 , 60% of organisations with more than 20 data scientists will require a professional code of conduct incorporating ethical use of D&amp;A. 3 . Relationship Analytics The emergence of relationship analytics highlights the growing use of graph , location and social analytical techniques to understand how different entities of interest -- people , places and things -- are connected . Analysing unstructured , constantly changing data can provide users information and context about associations in a network and deeper insights that improve the accuracy of predictions and decision-making . Many of the highest value applications are focused on discovery , where the questions to be answered are not known in advance . For example , relationship analytics based on graph techniques can identify illegal behavior and criminal activity . By analysing formal and informal networks of people , law enforcement agencies can identify money laundering and other criminal activities . It becomes easier for them to distinguish between malignant and benign behavior within networks . 4 . Decision Intelligence D&amp;A leaders draw on a wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This requires them to use a multitude of techniques to manage data effectively . The unpredictability of the outcomes of today 's decision models often stems from an inability properly to capture and account for the uncertainty factors linked to these models ' "" behavior "" in a business context . Decision intelligence provides a framework that brings together traditional and advanced techniques to design , model , align , execute , monitor and tune decision models . 5 . Operationalising and Scaling The number of use cases at the core of a business , on its edges and beyond is exploding . More people want to engage with data , and more interactions and processes need analytics in order to automate and scale . Analytics services and algorithms are increasingly activated whenever and wherever they are needed . Whether to justify the next big strategic move or to optimise millions of transactions and interactions gradually , analytics tools and the data that powers them are showing up in places where they rarely existed before . This is adding a whole new dimension to the concept of "" analytics everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olympiad winners spread across the nation <p> Oct 8 , 2019 <p> Learners from three provinces have taken the top places in the 2019 South African Programming Olympiad which is now in its 36th year . The gold medal winner was Andi Qu , a grade 11 learner at St John 's College , Johannesburg , who won the Standard Bank Trophy . This marks the return of the coveted trophy to Gauteng after three years in the Western Cape . Qu says he likes computational geometry and enjoys "" cool , ad-hoc problems "" more than the "" maths and data structure questions "" . Earlier this year , he represented South Africa at the International Olympiad in Informatics ( IOI ) in Azerbaijan . He has school honours for music and academics , and plans to study computer science and "" probably AI . "" Aaron Naidu of KwaZulu-Natal , and Taariq Mowzer of the Western Cape won the two silver medals . Naidu , in grade 12 at Eden College , says he enjoys "" entering all the competitions and Olympiads because they provide challenging questions that allow me to hone my skills and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "" He also came top in the 2019 SA Mathematics Olympiad . Mowzer , of Fairbairn College , and two-time winner of the Programming Olympiad gold medal , says that using past papers to prepare for the finals give "" a comprehensive understanding of where you struggle .

She was sponsored by De Beers through the Anglo American group to study chemical engineering and started off as a young metallurgist at the Cullinan diamond mine and also did early stints at Kimberley Mines , The Oaks and Voorspoed . <p> Zikalala , who holds a BSc in chemical engineering from the University of the Witwatersrand , enjoyed working at the various mines and firmly believes that young engineers need to spend time at the operations , where she recalls learning so much . <p> Her first general management role was at Kimberley Mines , now owned by KEM JV , where she succeeded in getting through the global economic crisis of 2008 with the help of what she describes as "" a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible in the mining industry is based on the success of the Voorspoed diamond mine , in the Free State , that operated for 10 years without a single fatality . <p> "" I feel the pain each and every time I hear about a fatality in our mining industry , simply because I have a fundamental belief that zero harm is possible , "" she said . <p> After Voorspoed , she took a slight detour away from mining when she was appointed senior VP for De Beers Sightholder Sales South Africa in Kimberley , which gave her essential insight into the sales side of the diamond business . <p> She remains a nonexecutive director of De Beers Sightholder Sales South Africa and has also served as non-executive director for the Black Management Forum and State-owned minerals research organisation Mintek . <p> She made a point of emphasising to Mining Weekly that more than 40% of the total gross sales of rough diamonds sold by De Beers in South Africa are sold to local beneficiators , which is a great value-adding plus for the South African economy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointment is the repositioning of the company 's technical and sustainability business function under Burger Greeff . This involves new mining projects , including the Chidliak project , in Canada , mine closure portfolio , as well as the implementation of Anglo American 's all-important FutureSmart Mining technology . <p> "" Whenever I say De Beers , read it as Anglo American because clearly Anglo American owns a huge part of our business . When we look at technology , particularly in mining and processing for Chidliak in the Arctic region of Canada , we 're working with Anglo American technology development head Donovan Waller . <p> "" In technical and sustainability , Anglo American is playing a crucial role . We 're all implementing the Anglo American operating model , to drive operational planning and work management , and is something that we fundamentally believe in , "" she said . <p> The FutureSmart Mining approach will be fully implemented at the high-quality Chidliak project , which was acquired last year from Peregrine Diamonds . Chidliak is located on Canada 's Baffin Island , 120 km north-east of Iqaluit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the diamond resources are there . The critical aspect for us is to shape that into the mine of the future , "" she said . <p> "" At the other end of the scale is mine closure , and much attention is being given to achieving closure at the Voorspoed Mine , Snap Lake and Victor Mine in a responsible and exemplary manner . <p> "" Excellence is also being vigorously pursued at existing operations , where we are driving for P101 performance . The target of P101 is to exceed industry best-practice performance . <p> "" <p> Using P101 , the Gahcho Ku ? plant has been elevated well above its nameplate capacity of three-million tonnes a year . <p> With the $2-billion Venetia underground project extending the life of the Limpopo mine to at least 2046 , the flexibility of being able to implement effective existing technology , as well as future technologies , is being provided . <p> "" For us , the mine of the future is about being fatality and injury free , "" Zikalala underlined . <p> Gahcho Ku ? , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president and CEO Stuart Brown , a former De Beers Group CFO . The De Beers group owns 51% of the mine and Mountain Province owns 49% . <p> "" We 're both very proud of what we see happening at Gahcho Ku ? , "" said Zikalala , who has committed to visiting Canada at least four times a year . <p> She recently spent two weeks in Canada and will be returning during the month of June . She places great store on leadership visibility and also on ensuring that contact is made with critical stakeholders in South Africa and in Canada . <p> "" Technology and innovation are critical . One of these days , we 'll tell you about Ignite , which focuses on how we approach innovation and technology . We see technology and innovation as levers to move our business into a significantly improved space , "" she said . <p> Synthetic Diamond Manufacturing <p> Industrial diamond manufacturing has been a long-standing part of De Beers Group . <p> Element Six , which produces synthetic diamond and supermaterials in Springs , was established in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material , carbon 's extreme and diverse properties give it high tensile strength , chemical inertia , extreme levels of hardness , thermal shock resistance and thermal conductivity . <p> Element Six products have for long been used in drill tips and medical equipment , for example . <p> Then there is De Beers Technology ( Debtech ) , which focuses on upstream technology . Zikalala describes it as having the most amazing X-ray machines and X-ray transmission technology used at the final end of the production plant , the final recovery . <p> Abroad , there is also De Beers Technologies in Maidenhead , in the UK , which focuses primarily on mid- and downstream technology . <p> "" Having worked in the midstream side of the business , I 'm absolutely amazed by what those machines are capable of . It 's not only the accuracy but also the speed at which they sort those tiny , tiny diamonds -- and they get it right . <p> "" We also have another business unit that looks at downstream technology . On the gems side , we announced Lightbox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already operating and we 're constructing our factory in Oregon , in the US , "" she said . <p> Lightbox brings pink , blue and white laboratory-grown diamonds to the jewellery sector in a selection of accessibly priced earring and necklace designs . <p> Botswana and Namibia <p> Zikalala described the De Beers Group businesses in South Africa and Canada , as well as the joint ventures with the government of Botswana and the government of Namibia , as being in close alignment . <p> "" When you look at the approach , it is clearly aligned , "" Zikalala enthused . <p> This was De Beers Group CEO Bruce Cleaver 's comment in the company 's media release that announced her new appointment : "" Our businesses in these countries face very different challenges and require a leader of Mpumi 's skill , vision and experience to maximise their full potential . I 'm personally very pleased to see her step into this role , which she does with my full support . "" <p> This is an interesting time in the precious metals , precious minerals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformations brought about by technology , regulations , exogenous political and economic trends and competitive pressures , CPM Group managing partner Jeffrey Christian commented in a note to Mining Weekly . <p> The buy side and sell side of markets are being impacted by moves towards artificial intelligence and computer- generated trading , the disappearance of market intermediaries and insupportably high operating costs . <p> "" Mining is being transformed as well , with technological innovations long in the works and long overlooked changing the profile , while general investor interest has plunged in what appears to be both cyclical and semi-permanent ways , "" Christian added . <p> South Africa and Canada are hugely important to the future of De Beers Group and the company is intent on continuing to grow and invest in both countries . The company is intensively engaged in greenfield diamond exploration in South Africa and Canada , which it regards as being highly prospective for diamonds . <p> "" I 'm excited .

"<h> What is Hybrid Cloud ? <p> A hybrid cloud is a combination of one or more public and private cloud environments . It is a set of virtual resources -- developed from hardware that is owned and managed by a third-party company , and hardware that belongs to the company that uses the cloud . Users can access resources on demand through self-service portals that are supported by automatic scaling and dynamic resource allocation . <p> Although the public and private cloud environments that make up a hybrid cloud are still single and individual entities , the migration between them is simplified with the use of application programming interfaces ( APIs ) that help transfer resources and workloads . This independent and connected architecture allows companies to execute critical workloads in the private cloud and less sensitive workloads in the public cloud , and extract resources from any of the two environments as they wish . <h> Hybrid Features <p> Current hybrid cloud environments can include , among other features , local infrastructure , traditional virtualization , servers without an operating system , and containers . In addition , the hybrid cloud can be made up of several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this you can find on Aviatrix website . <p> What interests everyone is how Hybrid cloud works . Interoperability is the fundamental basis of hybrid clouds . Without it , public and private clouds can exist independently , but they are not considered hybrid clouds , even if they are used by the same company . <p> It is possible to manage hybrid cloud environments manually with several management tools , redundant policy implementations and additional operations personnel . However , there are cloud management tools that simplify the process because they provide unified management and operations for hybrid environments . <p> A private cloud can simplify scalability and provide on-demand access to resources , in addition to what can be easily achieved with virtualization on its own . Public clouds can further facilitate scalability , providing access to an unlimited ( in theory ) pool of resources . When both distributions are integrated in a hybrid environment , it is possible to scale vertically or horizontally , as necessary . Clouds support native cloud applications with horizontal scalability , and virtualization supports traditional workloads through vertical scalability . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially valuable for dynamic or highly changing workloads . For example , a transactional order entry system that experiences significant demand peaks around the holiday season is a good candidate for the hybrid cloud . The application could run in the private cloud , but use the explosion of the cloud to access the additional computing resources of a public cloud when computing demands peak . To connect public and private cloud resources , this model requires a hybrid cloud environment . <p> Another hybrid case of using the cloud is the processing of big data . A company , for example , could use hybrid cloud storage to retain its accumulated business , sales , test and other data , and then run analytic queries in the public cloud , which can scale to support demanding distributed computing tasks . <p> Despite its benefits , the hybrid cloud can present technical , managerial and managerial challenges . Private cloud workloads must have access to and interact with public cloud providers , so the hybrid cloud requires API support and strong network connectivity . <p> If you generally love tech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media , gadgets , artificial intelligence , telcos and technological advancements in Ghana or tech companies and startups in Ghana , you 'll feel right at home here ."

"<h> Email <p> THERE is no doubt that you are at your most vulnerable when ill and confined to a hospital bed as you have to rely entirely on the sense of duty or the kindness and compassion of someone for the very basic of needs . <p> Having experienced this myself this summer when an accident left me needing surgery and immobilised for a period of time , I was so , so grateful for my incredible wife and daughters . Equally , the commitment and compassion of the nursing staff makes me misty-eyed on reflection . <p> If I 'd have had to brave a full-fledged riot in that helpless state , with some of the rioters liberally using sticks , stones and bricks and , as in one photographed instance , even a pistol , I doubt I would have survived . <p> Ergo , I ca n't even begin to imagine what the patients and their family/friends went through at the Punjab Institute of Cardiology this week when the men in black let loose their fury at the hospital in Lahore . Imagine the fear , the grave anxiety gripping the heart already weakened by disease . <p> Not too many have focused on the abject , miserable failure that is the Punjab government . <p> A lot has been written , but surely still not enough about how barbaric and shameful the marauding lawyers were . Many demands have been made that those involved must face the harshest possible sanction under the law . But the dead ca n't be resurrected . <p> The pain , anguish and fear of those who were forced to brave the nightmare , while grappling with cardiac disorders , may resurface with each hospital visit and , heaven forbid , should they need hospitalisation again . Post-traumatic stress is very real . <p> How can any ' punishment ' be enough , or even be quantified , for those responsible ? <p> However , let 's not be na ? ve . The lawyers whose audacity and criminal behaviour was the subject of live telecasts on multiple channels deserved every bit of the opprobrium they got . But not too many focused on the abject , miserable failure that is the Punjab government . <p> The tragic episode , by my reckoning the first of its kind in Pakistan in which a hospital was attacked , was the culmination of a running feud between two groups of professionals ie the lawyers on the one side and the PIC doctors and paramedical staff on the other . <p> For several days , the administration remained paralysed and took no action to defuse the situation by enforcing the law . Then finally on that day of shame , the charged , vociferous lawyers walked more than five kilometres from the courts unimpeded to the PIC ; the administration did nothing . <p> Let me tell you why this happened . Since the day of its inauguration , the government from the prime minister down to the lowliest minions of the governing PTI have had one priority : the hunting and hounding of their political opponents . <p> This seems to have affected the orientation of the law-enforcement agencies from the paramilitary forces to police to the country 's multi-organisation , intelligence setup . So , was it a surprise that when an occasion arose warranting robust policing , those responsible were found wanting ? <p> The multifaceted law-enforcement machinery is not inefficient . Its full , ' efficient ' wrath is unleashed to telling effect against political opponents and dissidents . Believe me , I know what I am talking about . Just go to Twitter and search for ' Okara lawyer ' for evidence . <p> You will see a one-minute video on the enforced disappearance of lawyer Ahmad Shafiq on Dec 10 . This is the second time he has been kidnapped . He is also facing a case ( placing anti-state material on social media ) by the FIA under the cybercrime law , enacted so stubbornly by PML-N minister Anushey Rehman 's overruling many voices of sanity . <p> In the CCTV video , the impunity and efficiency of the state agencies are on full display -- from start to finish when a white Toyota corolla car comes to a halt and a couple of masked men alight , to the time these two and some three to four of their accomplices grab and shove the brave lawyer into the car and drive away . <p> I say brave because a quick look at his Twitter timeline demonstrates what sort of ( in the FIA 's view ) ' anti-state ' content he was putting out on social media . His crime was no more than yours or mine : believing some policies of our state are not in the national interest . Expressing dissent . That 's all . <p> The state was clinical in the disappearance of human rights activist Idris Khattak , who disappeared without trace a few weeks ago and is still to be found . These were people who raised conscientious objections to the state 's unlawful actions but were citizens like you and me . <p> Look at what happened to Rana Sanaullah Khan , the PML-N MNA , whose National Assembly performance caused so much discomfort to the hybrid regime that he was arrested from the Faisalabad-Lahore motorway . Some 15 kilograms of heroin were allegedly recovered from him . <p> It was another matter that the Lahore Safe City Cameras recorded important segments of the episode and it turns out that timeline of the case , filed and prosecuted by the military-led ANF , was all over the place , casting serious doubts about the charges . <p> One can go on endlessly about how efficient the state is whether in the case of locking up former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi or former finance minister Dr Miftah Ismail after the two reportedly spurned overtures by powerful quarters to assist the PTI government . <p> Grateful for small mercies even then are we . The four Baloch women who were arrested in Awaran for carting ' arms and ammunition ' for anti-state ' terrorists ' were released at the intervention of former Balochistan chief minister Akhtar Mengal , currently an MNA . His party provides vital numerical support to sustain the PTI government in Islamabad . <p> In the absence of the rule of law , people seek safety in numbers and resort to tribalism . What else would prompt two of my favourite public figures , lawyers Raza Rabbani and Ali Ahmad Kurd , to say there might be justification for the PIC attack ? There is n't one . <p> Those of us without the safety net of such tribalism can be likened to patients in a huge hospital ward , bereft of compassion and at the mercy of the next marauder . <h> On DawnNews <h> Comments ( 5 ) Closed <p> Excellent analysis . How can Punjab Government justify its decision to allow agitated lawyers to demonstrate in front of a hospital when such activity is not allowed under Geneva Convention during war . <p> Recommend0 <p> F Khan <p> Dec 15 , 2019 10:23am <p> Just think if this PIC incident would have happened during SS tenure.How would have PTI reacted ? <p> Recommend0 <p> Liaquat Thaheem <p> Dec 15 , 2019 11:54am <p> ' Let me tell you this happened .

"<h> Dimitar Berbatov : Teams not scared of Manchester United <p> Manchester United have lost their fear factor , says Dimitar Berbatov , with the Red Devils needing to find a way of making rivals "" sh*t themselves in the tunnel "" again . <p> There was a time not all that long ago when visitors to Old Trafford would be beaten before a ball was kicked . <p> The aura created by Sir Alex Ferguson 's all-conquering sides ensured that nobody fancied a trip to or visit from United . <p> That is no longer the case , with a humbling fall from grace having left the 13-time Premier League champions playing catch-up . <p> Berbatov , as a former Red Devils striker , admits something needs to be done about the mentality on the red half of Manchester , telling Betfair : "" At the moment teams are n't scared of United . Can you blame them ? <p> "" Teams are seeing the results that United are getting and where they have been finishing in the last couple of years and they believe they have a chance to get the win and the three points against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rochdale play it out from the back at Old Trafford , showing how they did n't care that they were playing against United , they were so confident even though they made a couple of mistakes it did n't matter . <p> "" United need to get back to when teams used to come to Old Trafford and sh*t themselves in the tunnel and hopefully they can put that fear back into the teams soon . "" <p> It promises to be a long road back to the top for United , with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer currently finding that out the hard way . <p> Questions are being asked of his suitability to a demanding role , but Berbatov wants to see a member of the club 's iconic 1999 Treble-winning squad given time in which to get things right . <p> The Bulgarian added : "" The pressure on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is there and the truth is it 's a difficult situation . <p> "" When you lose matches people want you out and when you win nobody says anything . <p> "" For me United still need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coach to go every time there are a few bad results , the next one will come in and it will be the same , it 's a vicious circle and you can not escape that . So , they need to give him more time , the games and the standards have n't been there recently but I 'm sure they are working hard on the training pitch . <p> "" I sincerely hope that he can turn things around . I love him as a human , a football player and I want him to succeed as a coach . He is at the club where he is a legend , the club have given him a chance and he has great staff and people around him . <p> "" It is a matter of time , let 's not forget Sir Alex Ferguson won the league in his sixth season so it 's a long process and it 's not as easy as people think .

This is after the state-owned South African broadcasting giant ; Sentech has dropped its appeal after losing the battle for distribution of its signal on free-to-air decoders to eBotswana . <p> According to Dave Coles , eBotswana Managing Director , Sentech has 90 days to re-encrypt its signal so that it does not get pirated or accessed through free-to-air Chinese decoders in Botswana . Sentech has informed them that decoders like Wiztech , Philibao , Fortec Star and Vivid will be cut-off on July 1 . As a result of this viewers in Botswana will not be able to view popular channels like SABC 1 , 2 and 3 free anymore . <p> Coles said : "" Their lawyers informed us last week that they are no longer pursuing the case . They said they also put an advert in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cease transmitting the signal to Vivid platforms . We are taking that with a pinch of salt though , we will believe when we see it happen , remember this is not the first time we hear something like this . "" <p> In February 2012 , eBotswana , a subsidiary of South Africa 's eTV approached the Johannesburg High Court seeking an order compelling Sentech to encrypt its signal , as failure to do so had given rise to signal piracy through free-to-air decoders . The court found Sentech to be "" wrongful , negligent and in breach "" for its failure to encrypt the signal . The court had ordered Sentech to take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure that the signal is encrypted to prevent pirate viewing of the SABC channels carried on the Vivid platform . <p> However , Coles said that despite the promise to re-encrypt the signal , eBotswana will still claim damages . He argued that despite Sentech knowing about the piracy , they turned a blind eye . "" This piracy has taken a toll on us financially and we will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not disclose how much right now but it 's going to be millions , "" he explained . He said eBotswana has applied for a licence to go national and migrate from terrestrial to digital signal broadcast next month . "" We are still in talks with Botswana Communications Regulations Authority ( BOCRA ) and according to their response , hopefully in the next month , we will be able to go from terrestrial to digital and expand our reach , "" said Coles . <p> eBotswana is engaging Multichoice , which is currently studying their proposal to see if it will profitably correlate with their business model . Ever since eBotswana introduced e-news in September last year , its viewership has grown , according to the MD . <p> His observation is that local channels are failing to make profit "" because advertisers target the Botswana market through the SABC channels in free-to-air decoders .

"<h> No future for jobs in the info-tech sector <h> Sagging growth and automation seen killing positions at middle/junior levels <p> The IT sector , country 's largest private sector employer with a total headcount of 3.7 million , may not offer as many jobs in the years to come . <p> Business growth has been teetering . From 13.9 per cent in 2013-14 , IT export growth has dropped to 10.2 per cent in 2015-16 and is estimated to fall further to 8-10 per cent in 2016-17 . Also , new-age technologies , including automation and artificial intelligence , are trimming manpower requirement . In the past five years , while IT exports have grown at an average 13.7 per cent annually , the headcount growth has been only 8 per cent . <p> In a report in June , HFS Research said that by 2021 India could lose 6.4 lakh low-skilled positions in IT services and the BPO industry because of the automation of support and back-office processing work . Taking into account the new medium/high-skill jobs that will be created , it forecast a net job loss of 4.8 lakh . The loss in jobs will be largely in middle-level positions , says Pareekh Jain , Research Vice-President , HFS Research . <p> "" The industry is very top-heavy now , and it ca n't sustain like this . In 2001 , the distribution of junior- , middle- and senior-level positions in the Indian IT services industry was 67 per cent , 31 per cent , and 2 per cent , respectively . But , now , the count of junior-level positions is less than half of the combined count of middle- and senior-level positions . This is leading to higher cost for companies and , since growth is falling , they are not able to pay for these high-cost employees ... Every industry faces this problem , heavy recruitment in boom years creates problems in the mature phase . "" <p> Not many jobs <p> If the intake of freshers by the IT industry drops and there is job loss too , it may push up the country 's unemployment rate . The IT sector is likely to add 5-6 lakh jobs between 2015-16 and 2018-19 , or about two lakh jobs in a year , according to Nasscom . In the last five years , the industry generated 2.3-2.5 lakh jobs annually . <p> The employment scenario in other sectors is no better either . Labour Ministry data show that in 2015 , the eight large sectors for employment -- textile , leather , metals , automobiles , jewellery , transport , handloom/powerloom and IT/BPO -- added only about 1.35 lakh jobs , a sharp drop from 4.21 lakh jobs in 2014 . Baij Nath Rai , President , Bharatiya Majdoor Sangh , says , "" We see job loss across sectors , especially in textile , handloom , and tea .... Now , if the IT sector is also going to trim its workforce , it may have a serious impact . "" Employees in the IT sector need to be open to learning new skills , says Nasscom . Between 2015-16 and 2018-19 , 1-1.5 million of the IT workforce will have to be re-skilled to be competitive . <p> External environment <p> In an interview to PTI , former Infosys CFO TV Mohandas Pai acknowledged that IT companies may have underestimated the hostile external business environment and the speed of change in the technology space .

"<h> Keenan : Science close to uncovering the ' molecular scars ' of child abuse <p> Events from the U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings to the rise of the #MeToo movement have brought child abuse , both sexual and non-sexual , out of the shadows . Still , decades-old allegations are often difficult to prove and may hinge on the memories of the people involved . What if there was a physical record of abuse stored in the body that could be analyzed scientifically ? <p> New research may open the door to just such a technique . Scientists at Harvard and the University of British Columbia have discovered significant differences in the sperm of men who were and were not victims of childhood abuse . <p> Their secrets are written as epigenetic modifications to their genomes . These are biochemical changes , such as the addition of a methyl group , that can turn genes on and off , even though they do n't modify the basic DNA structure . <p> Researchers led by Andrea Roberts , of Harvard 's T.H. Chan School of Public Health , compared sperm samples from young adult men who reported childhood physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found eight DNA regions that were more than 10 per cent different , and one region with a 29 per cent difference . The scientists say it 's too early to say if these epigenetic changes will affect the health of the person or his offspring . <p> In an interview from Cambridge , Mass. , Roberts said that "" The big question is how does child abuse get under the skin to affect the physical and mental health , and one of the hypotheses is that it affects these tags that rest on your genes . "" <p> Asked if she thought this technique might have forensic uses in the future , Roberts said , "" It 's not implausible , though it would require much bigger studies . "" She notes that the ' epigenetic clock ' is already used by police to determine the approximate age of the person who supplied a blood or other tissue sample . "" We also know that people who have had traumatic experiences have an older biological age than their chronological age , so you can sort of see their aging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DNAge ? Epigenetic Aging Clock , based on the work of UCLA professor Steve Horvath , and sold commercially by Zymo Research . It was used in Germany to test a refugee claimant who said he was under the age of 18 . Because of a lack of precision with this technique , this application was highly controversial . <p> UBC medical genetics professor Michael Kobor , senior author on the Harvard/UBC study , is optimistic that sperm epigenetics may someday wind up in courtrooms or even Senate hearing rooms . "" It 's conceivable that the correlations we found between methylation and child abuse might provide a percentage probability that abuse had occurred , "" he says . <p> One of the big questions arising from this research is whether or not these epigenetic changes can be passed on to offspring . Roberts notes that "" when the sperm meets the egg , there is a massive amount of genetic reshuffling , and most of the methylation is at least temporarily erased . "" However , she cites evidence showing that male mice pass on the epigenetic effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "" it 's not crazy to think that might happen in humans . "" <p> In addition to legal implications , epigenetics may play a role in designing treatments and new drugs . Researchers at the University of Parma and the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse recently published a paper on DNA methylation and Cannabis Use Disorder , which is basically the misuse of pot which causes serious distress or impairment . <p> These scientists found "" a significantly higher level of DNA methylation in cannabis users compared to controls in two of the genes tested . "" They go on to suggest that "" the differentially methylated regions may represent biomarkers and/or potential targets for designs of pharmacological therapeutic agents . "" <p> Another recent study found that excessive alcohol consumption appears to speed up the epigenetic aging process . Also , Swedish adolescents who had hypermethylation on a particular gene tended to have more psychological stress and reported being bullied and depressed more than those without this epigenetic trait . <p> The whole field of biomarkers is exploding rapidly , and it 's a good time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in its early days . Scientists have an imperfect understanding of how epigenetic traits affect a person 's health , and there 's always the problem of figuring out what are causes and what are effects . <p> What we are learning is that the body stores a great deal of information and that machine learning techniques , which were used in the Harvard/UBC study , can assist in unravelling it . It will take a brave expert witness to bring epigenetic evidence of childhood abuse into a court of law . But that day is definitely coming , and these new studies bring it closer in a tantalizing way . <p> Tom Keenan is an award-winning journalist , public speaker , professor in the Faculty of Environmental Design at the University of Calgary , and author of the bestselling book , Technocreep , ( www.technocreep.com ) . <h> This Week 's Flyers <h> Comments <p> We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts .

"<h> Look to history to prepare for an automated future <p> LONDON * Disruptive technologies are now dictating our future , as new innovations increasingly blur the lines between physical , digital and biological realms . Robots are already in our operating rooms and fast-food restaurants ; we can now use 3D imaging and stem-cell extraction to grow human bones from a patient 's own cells ; and 3D printing is creating a circular economy in which we can use and then reuse raw materials . <p> This tsunami of technological innovation will continue to profoundly change how we live and work , and how our societies operate . In what is now called the Fourth Industrial Revolution , technologies that are coming of age - including robotics , nanotechnology , virtual reality , 3D printing , the Internet of Things , artificial intelligence and advanced biology - will converge . And as these technologies continue to be developed and widely adopted , they will bring about radical shifts in all disciplines , industries and economies , and in the way that we produce , distribute , consume and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious questions about what role humans will play in a technology-driven world . A 2013 University of Oxford study estimates that close to half of all jobs in the United States could be lost to automation over the next two decades . On the other hand , economists such as Boston University 's James Bessen argue that automation often goes hand in hand with the creation of new jobs . So which is it - new jobs or massive structural unemployment ? <p> We can be certain that the Fourth Industrial Revolution will have a disruptive impact on employment , but no one can yet predict the scale of change . So , before we swallow all the bad news , we should look at history , which suggests that technological change more often affects the nature of work , rather than the opportunity to participate in work itself . <p> The First Industrial Revolution moved British manufacturing from people 's homes into factories , and marked the beginning of hierarchical organisation . This change was often violent , as the famous early-19th century Luddite riots in England demonstrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural areas to industrial centres , and it was during this period that the first labour movements emerged . <p> The Second Industrial Revolution ushered in electrification , large-scale production , and new transportation and communication networks , and created new professions such as engineering , banking and teaching . This was when middle classes emerged , and began to demand new social policies and an increased role for government . During the Third Industrial Revolution , modes of production were further automated by electronics and by information and communication technology , with many jobs moving from manufacturing into services . <p> In the 1970s , it was assumed that the arrival of ATMs would be a disaster for workers in retail banking . And yet , the number of bank branch jobs increased over time as costs fell . The nature of the job had changed : It became less transactional and more focused on customer service . <p> Disruption has accompanied each previous industrial revolution , and the fourth will be no different . But if we keep in mind the lessons of history , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on skills , and not just on the specific jobs that will appear or disappear . If we determine which skill sets we will need , we can educate and train the human workforce to leverage all of the new opportunities that technology creates . Human resources departments , educational institutions and governments should lead the charge . <p> Second , past experience has repeatedly shown that disadvantaged classes must be protected ; workers who are vulnerable to being displaced by technology must have the time and means to adjust . As we saw last year , there can be far-reaching consequences when vast inequalities of opportunities and outcomes lead people to believe that they have no future . <p> Last but not least , to ensure that this revolution translates into economic growth and bears fruit for all , we must work together to create new regulatory ecosystems . Governments will have a crucial role to play but business and civil society leaders will also need to collaborate with governments to determine the appropriate regulations and standards for new technologies and industries . <p> I am under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology , will determine the pace of change , and implementing the necessary reforms will be hard , slow work , particularly in democracies .

"<h> Making technology in retail work <p> Apr 20 , 2018 <p> A shop sends its valued customer , John , a text message about a sale on a brand of shower gel . <p> It is John 's favourite scent , the perfect size , priced at a discount , and timed just as John arrives home to discover he 's run out of shower gel , which means he has a few minutes to click a link , go online and order the gel before dashing off to the gym . <p> The shower gel is delivered by a drone just as he arrives at the gym , along with a free pair of promotional flip flops , meaning he can take a shower without having to bare his feet . <p> All this , and John is the only human involved in the entire transaction . <p> This is how retailers of the not-too-distant future will operate if they are n't already . Intelligent systems can predict customers ' specific needs and meet these needs at the right time , while collecting more information about their regular activities , rate of consumption and preference channels . Gone will be the spray-and-pray approach of direct text and email marketing . <p> Retailers ' investment in artificial intelligence ( AI ) is increasing exponentially as major global merchants seek to gain a competitive edge on each other . The role of big data analytics driven by AI and machine learning will be deeply embedded into every area of businesses , including sales , CRM applications , customer recommendations , manufacturing , logistics and payments services . <p> The better retailers use big data to optimise inventory and supply chain management , the more they can eliminate delays , reduce wastage and ensure that the right product is available at the right time to the right customer . It 's already becoming commonplace for retailers to use big data analytics to better understand and service their customers , optimise their inventory levels and make improvements to their supply chains . <p> IT departments are slowly moving out of their historical support function to become key business enablers . They are no longer just responding to technical requests from the business but are providing more strategic input at the conceptual stage of business system planning and design . To avoid the pitfalls of unfocused investment , retailers looking for a new AI-enabled system need to take several key considerations into account . <p> Skills , skills , skills <p> Established mass retailers are struggling to integrate advanced technology into their business models as they do n't yet fully understand the skills they need to implement an actualised and integrated technology solution . For example , marketers will develop creative promotions but overlook the vital consideration of the customer experience during the purchase journey , which is vital for the IT department to be involved with from the outset . <p> Attracting skilled data scientists is a challenge . For example , there are approximately just over 100 fully qualified data scientists in the world ( 23% hold a PHD and 44% hold a Master 's Degree ) and a further 60 000 people working on various parts of data science and analytics ( as shown on LinkedIn ) . The fight for these sought-after resources expands globally . <p> These data scientists are n't just IT technicians , but experts who understand the complex process of designing systems that continuously improve customer experiences . The complexity of data analytics arises in cleaning up the data provided to identify trends that tell a customer story . <p> While artificial intelligence ( AI ) can help in digitising the raw data into insight-driven analytics , data science skills are critical in allocating the correct resources in the right places . <p> Start from the ground up <p> A key challenge is integrating older , legacy systems into technologically-advanced systems . New technologies or systems should n't be a plug-in or add-on to a legacy system , but rather used in the design stage of a brand-new solution or product . <p> A retailer looking to develop an e-commerce platform needs to adopt system design thinking from the outset of any product development process or marketing campaign . This should take the customer 's preferred purchasing method into account , as well as provide opportunities for the collection of more information about the customer . <p> Shopping habits are shifting <p> Technology has moved the point of sale from the physical store into the consumer 's hand . While a lot of consumers still want the touch and feel of certain products , such as designer fashion , the commodification of an increasing list of items means people are spending less time in stores in favour of the convenience of e-commerce . <p> Traditional payments using cash and credit/debit cards are also making way for mobile payment methods such as Snapscan , Masterpass , Zapper and even cryptocurrencies , adding flexibility for customers and opportunity for merchants without card facilities and/or bank accounts . <p> This is part of the reason that major retailers such as Pick ' n Pay are exploring cryptocurrencies as an alternative payment method . <p> Security risks <p> As more e-commerce platforms emerge , we find that retailers tend to overlook the importance of security integration . Much of the customer information sits in flat databases while security solutions do n't match the investment in other areas of the IT department , meaning security is almost seen as a grudge purchase or add on . <p> Unfortunately , in the sprawling e-commerce landscape , security is usually the last thing retailers consider . The business is intensely focused on creating a working e-commerce solution , but security is often an afterthought . Security should n't be reactive -- it 's critical to be integrated from the beginning and not once the system is in place . <p> Rethink special offers <p> In the past , retailers would allocate vouchers to their customers based on their own inventory of what they can afford to give away , which has never been and is no longer good enough . <p> As consumers are inundated with an increasing amount of promotions and electronic vouchers , retailers need to use the vast wealth of data analytics available to tailor highly relevant and personalised offers aimed at building a long-term relationship with them . <p> For instance , should the retailer recognise poor service in a past customer engagement , the next targeted offer might refer to this incident in its communication -- a personal touch that not only communicates that a lapse in service quality was identified , but that the company has taken the time and effort to address that customer 's immediate and possible future needs . <p> The future of technology <p> Increasingly , we will start seeing much better use of AI applications that make data mining and data management more efficient . Machine learning and statistical algorithms will help retailers integrate customer relationship management ( CRM ) , inventory and supply chain management systems seamlessly . <p> As more data becomes available these smart systems will offer better prediction of future outcomes , accurate insights and targeted promotions relevant to customer needs ."

"<p> A team of astronomers from the University of Hawai ? i at Manoa 's Institute for Astronomy ( IfA ) has produced the most comprehensive astronomical imaging catalog of stars , galaxies , and quasars ever created with help from an artificially intelligent neural network . <p> Advertisement <p> The group of astronomers from the University of Hawai ? i at Manoa 's Institute for Astronomy ( IfA ) released a catalog containing 3 billion celestial objects in 2016 , including stars , galaxies , and quasars ( the active cores of supermassive black holes ) . Needless to say , the parsing of this extensive database -- packed with 2 petabytes of data -- was a task unfit for puny humans , and even grad students . A major goal coming out of the 2016 catalog release was to better characterize these distant specks of light , and to also map the arrangement of galaxies in all three dimensions .

These measures of colors and sizes of objects numbered in the millions , as Robert Beck , the lead author of the study and a former cosmology postdoctoral fellow at IfA , explained in the press release . <p> "" Utilizing a state-of-the-art optimization algorithm , we leveraged the spectroscopic training set of almost 4 million light sources to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distances , while at the same time correcting for light extinction by dust in the Milky Way , "" Beck said . <p> These training sessions worked well ; the ensuing neural network did a bang up job when tasked with sorting the objects , achieving success rates of 98.1% for galaxies , 97.8% for stars , and 96.6% for quasars . The system also determined the distances to galaxies , which were at most only off by about 3% . The resulting work is "" the world 's largest three-dimensional astronomical imaging catalog of stars , galaxies and quasars , "" according to the University of Hawai'i . <p> Advertisement <p> "" This beautiful map of the universe provides one example of how the power of the Pan-STARRS big data set can be multiplied with artificial intelligence techniques and complementary observations , "" explained team member and study co-author Kenneth Chambers .

"<p> NDTV 's e-commerce portal Gadgets 360 is about everything related to technology , be it news , latest products reviews and even opinions and analyses . Talking about their recently launched campaign pricee.com , the Indian search engine for shopping , Bhawna Agarwal , CEO , Gadgets 360 , revealed how with the help of Google , they built it on the basis of machine data and learning and how it has already secured 4 million successful searches and also talked about the challenges they faced . Excerpts : <p> What are the challenges you typically face while keeping up with technology ? One of the biggest challenges today is that technology is itself pacing up and one should constantly keep it up with it . One must stay on top of the game with regard to advancement in technology . Especially in today 's competitive world it is said , "" The newer it is , the better it is . "" Predicting a transition from a start-up to a pure-play scale up model and deciphering what kind of talent , what kind of changes is required is again very challenging for the DNA of an organisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a future scenario , anticipating about the ' what 's next ' wave of major opportunity and what value can be created for clients is also taken into consideration . If we talk about creating value for our customers , we need to build that in the future with our products.We are a company that believes in developing a business that is sustainable and scalable but we also do it in a more responsible and creative way , which is what makes it challenging but exciting too . <p> How much do you think the digital picture has changed since the time Gadgets 360 began its journey ? Digital is constantly growing . There has been a steady increase in user penetration . I think the debate is now moving on from internet penetration to the newer type of businesses which are completely changing the game.Talking about our journey , there has been a lot of development , not only within the company , but also outside the ecosystem . I will call it a good change because people now know about what to buy in gadgets , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people did n't understand Augmented Reality but now times have changed.Each single day is presenting a lot of challenges as well as opportunities for us to do something new and different , and that led us to completely reinvent ourselves every month . From that prospective , the space in which we are working has completely changed from when we began . <p> How much do you think Gadgets 360 has had an impact in terms of viewership under the label of NDTV ? I personally think that we were really fortunate to get some really good investors . When we started off , I think the NDTV name really helped us in building credibility and trust about us.Earlier it was called NDTV Gadget but then we underwent a re-branding exercise . So that name and credibility helped us so much in re-branding Gadget 360 and we were able to clearly differentiate ourselves in terms of being the most credible platform for tech lovers in India . We as a company also took many initiatives and taking leverage of that , 70-80% of our traffic is completely organic because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a very powerful medium of acquisition and that means we rely less on spending money.When we started we were ranked in the top 50 and now we come in top 11 leaving behind many popular tech platforms . <p> Do you see any change in the traffic on your site due to the interference of social media platforms ? Today everybody is on social media . It has become part of everybody 's growth strategy because people right now first like to discuss things before they move on to the platform be it a shopping site or a news site.Good thing is , we have millions of fans and followers on social media . Social media is such a powerful tool for engaging consumers.For us it is very important to update everything on social media platforms because it is a very important contributor to our success and it generates rather robust visits for us . We clearly see that traffic increasing even more . <p> What will be the assets for Gadgets 360 in 2018 ? We are neither an e-commerce nor a content company . We consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology needs . We are a niche gadget and tech vertical company unlike anybody else in the world . We would definitely want our platform to be the preferred destination for consumers in India and abroad related to anything and everything to do with gadgets and tech . I think our understanding of consumers , the reach that we have , the credibility that we have built will help us in entering different geographical locations.We are also coming up with a new product that will be all about machine learning and Artificial Intelligence , but it 's too early to talk about that . But yes we will be aggressively working towards it.We are also working on the edge in terms of content and tech to empower our consumers with more knowledge . <p> What is your winning mantra to ensure a successful brand name in this very cluttered digital market ? I think it 's very-very cluttered . Our clear winning mantra is the further expansion of our hybrid model . We have 3Cs policy in our company that denotes Content , Community and Commerce and engagement around all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's very important for any brand to successfully scale up and to understand the territory you are working in . Playing to our strengths and differentiating ourselves makes us successful ."

"<h> Abstract <p> Observations of the redshift z = 7.085 quasar J1120+0641 are used to search for variations of the fine structure constant , a , over the redshift range 5:5 to 7:1 . Observations at z = 7:1 probe the physics of the universe at only 0.8 billion years old . These are the most distant direct measurements of a to date and the first measurements using a near-IR spectrograph . A new AI analysis method is employed . Four measurements from the x-shooter spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) constrain changes in a relative to the terrestrial value ( a0 ) . The weighted mean electromagnetic force in this location in the universe deviates from the terrestrial value by ? a/a = ( az - a0 ) /a0 = ( -2:18 ? 7:27 ) ? 10-5 , consistent with no temporal change . Combining these measurements with existing data , we find a spatial variation is preferred over a no-variation model at the 3:9s level . <h> INTRODUCTION <h> Theoretical background <p> What fundamental aspects of the universe give rise to the laws of Nature ? Are the laws finely tuned from the outset , immutable in time and space , or do they vary in space or time such that our local patch of the universe is particularly suited to our own existence ? We characterize the laws of Nature using the numerical values of the fundamental constants , for which increasingly precise and ever-distant measurements are accessible using quasar absorption spectra . <p> The quantity that we focus on here is the fine-structure constant , which can be expressed as a = e2/4pe0hc , where e is the electron charge , e0 is the permittivity of free space , h is the reduced Planck constant , and c is the speed of light . The dimensionless quantity described by a is the ratio of the speed of an electron in the lowest-energy orbit of the Bohr-Sommerfeld atom to the speed of light . a may be considered to relate quantum mechanics ( through h ) to electromagnetism ( through the remaining constants in the ratio ) . <p> The quest to determine whether the bare fine-structure constant , a , is a constant in space and time has received impetus from the recognition that there might be additional dimensions of space or that our constants are partly or wholly determined by symmetry breaking at ultrahigh energies in the very early universe . The first proposals for time variation in a by Stanyukovich ( 1 ) , Teller ( 2 ) , and Gamow ( 3 ) were motivated by the large-number coincidences noted by Dirac ( 4 , 5 ) but were quickly ruled out by observations ( 6 ) . This has led to an extensive literature on varying constants that is reviewed in ( 7 -- 11 ) . <p> There are also interesting new problems that have been about extreme fine-tuning of quantum corrections in theories with variation of a by Donoghue ( 12 ) and Marsh ( 13 ) . Accordingly , self-consistent theories of gravity and electromagnetism , which incorporate the fine-structure "" constant "" as a self-gravitating scalar field with self-consistent dynamics that couple to the geometry of spacetime , have been formulated in ( 14 -- 20 ) and extended to the Weinberg-Salam theory in ( 21 , 22 ) . They generalize Maxwell 's equations and general relativity in the way that Jordan-Brans-Dicke gravity theory ( 23 , 24 ) extends general relativity to include space or time variations of the Newtonian gravitational constant , G , by upgrading it to become a scalar field . This enables different constraints on a changing a(z) at different redshifts , z , to be coordinated ; it supersedes the traditional approach ( 25 ) to constraining varying a by simply allowing a to become a variable in the physical laws for constant a . Further discussions relating spatial variations of a to inhomogeneous cosmological models can be found in ( 26 , 27 ) . <p> Direct measurements of a are also important for testing dynamical dark energy models , since they help to constrain the dynamics of the underlying scalar field ( 11 ) , and thus , dynamics can be constrained ( through a ) even at epochs where dark energy is still not dominating the universe . The possibility of doing these measurements deep into the matter era is particularly useful , since most other cosmological datasets ( coming from type Ia supernovas , galaxy clustering , etc. ) are limited to lower redshifts . <p> The inputs needed for these theories come from a variety of different types of astronomical observations : high-precision observations of the instantaneous value of a(zi) characterizing quasar spectra at various redshifts zi to test possible time variations , both local and nonlocal measurements of a ( x ? ) at different positions in the universe ( 28 -- 30 ) to search for spatial variation , the cosmic microwave background ( 31 , 32 ) , the Oklo natural reactor ( 33 -- 36 ) , atomic clocks ( 7 , 37 , 38 ) , compact objects in which the local gravitational potential may be different ( 39 , 40 ) , or atomic line separations in white dwarf atmospheres ( 41 ) . <p> These detailed studies , using large numbers of quasar spectra , hint at a spatial variation of a at a level of 4s ( 42 -- 44 ) . The apparent spatial signal was initially claimed to be caused by long-range wavelength distortions ( 45 ) , but a more detailed analysis showed this to be incorrect ( 44 ) . This apparently persistent spatial signal motivates further direct measurements , especially by extending the measurement redshift range . <h> Observations and artificial intelligence algorithm <p> The relative wavelengths of absorption lines imprinted on the spectra of background quasars are sensitive to the fine-structure constant . Comparing quasar measurements with high-precision terrestrial experiments provides stringent constraints on any possible spacetime variations of the fine-structure constant , as predicted by some theoretical models ( 7 , 11 , 16 , 46 , 47 ) . The quasar J1120+0641 ( 48 ) is of particular interest in this context because of its very high redshift . Its emission redshift is z = 7.085 , corresponding to a look-back time of 12.96 billion years in standard ? CDM ( lambda cold dark matter ) cosmology . J1120+0641 is one of the most luminous quasars known ( 49 ) , enabling high spectral resolution at high signal-to-noise ratio . We make use of spectra obtained using the x-shooter spectrograph ( 50 ) on the European Southern Observatory 's Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) , with nominal spectral resolution R= ? a ? =7000to10,000 ( 51 ) . The total integration time is 30 hours . <p> The x-shooter instrument provides a broad spectral wavelength coverage . This maximizes the discovery probability of absorption systems along the sightline , enabling the identification of potential coincidences ( i.e. , blends ) between absorption species at different redshifts , an essential step in making a reliable measurement of a . In all , 11 absorption systems are detected ( Table 1 ) . Desirable characteristics of an absorption system are a selection of transitions with different sensitivities to a change in a and a velocity structure in the absorbing medium that is as simple as possible . <p> Absorption redshifts are listed in column 1 . Transitions present in each absorption system are listed in column 2 . The four absorption systems and transitions used to measure ? a/a are indicated in bold . <p> Of the 11 absorption systems identified along the J1120+0641 sightline , 4 are found to be suitable for a measurement of a , at redshifts zabs = 7.059,6.171,5.951 , and 5.507 . The atomic transitions used to measure a in these four systems are highlighted in Table 1 . The highest-redshift system has , of the four , the least sensitivity to varying a . No other direct quasar absorption a measurements have previously been made at such high redshift . Before the measurements described in this paper , the highest-redshift quasar absorption direct measurement of a was at z = 4.1798 ( 52 ) . Voigt profile models for each of the four absorption systems were automatically constructed using a genetic algorithm , gvpfit , which requires no human decision-making beyond initial setup parameters ( 53 ) . The genetic part of the procedure controls the evolution of the model development . vpfit ( 54 ) is called multiple times within each generation to refine the model , which then becomes the parent for subsequent generations . Absorption model complexity increases with each generation . A description of gvpfit can be found in ( 53 ) , where it was used for the analysis of an absorption system at zabs = 1.839 toward the quasar J110325-264515 . That particular system had previously been analyzed by several groups and so provided important comparative information between gvpfit and previous methods . Further assessments of gvpfit 's performance are given in ( 55 ) . The procedure outperforms human interactive methods in that it gives objective , reproducible , robust results and introduces no additional systematic uncertainties . The method is computationally demanding , requiring supercomputers . New procedures have been introduced for the analysis in this paper , beyond those described in ( 53 ) , and so are described here . <p> The analysis of each of the four absorption systems took place in four stages . Throughout , ? a/a is kept as a free-fitting parameter , making use of the Many-Multiplet Method ( 28 , 38 ) . In stage 1 , we imposed the requirement that all velocity components are present in all species being fitted , irrespective of line strength . Without this requirement , an absorbing component in one species might fall below the detection threshold determined by the spectral data quality , but not in another . This requirement was only applied in the first stage because it was found in practice to help model stability by discouraging the fitting procedure from finding a model with physically implausible cloud parameters in one or more components . By "" physically implausible , "" we mean either large linewidth , i.e. , a Voigt profile b parameter of tens of kilometers per second , or an improbably high column density . The requirement is dropped subsequently . gvpfit was allowed to evolve ( that is , the complexity of the model was allowed to increase ) for the number of generations required to pass through a minimum value of the corrected Akaike Information Criterion statistic ( AICc ) ( 56 , 57 ) . The model resulting from this first stage of the analysis is the model at which AICc is at a minimum and is already quite good but is not final . <p> In stage 2 , we use the model from stage 1 as the parent model input to gvpfit but now drop the requirement that all velocity components are present . The other requirements from stage 1 were carried over to stage 2 . At this stage , one further increase in model complexity is introduced . Although the spectral continuum model was derived before the line fitting process , we allow for residual uncertainties in continuum estimation where needed by including additional free parameters allowing the local continuum for each region to vary using a simple linear correction as described in the vpfit manual ( http : **37;7576;TOOLONG ) ... The minimum AICc model from this stage is again taken as the parent model for the next stage . <p> In stage 3 , we check to see whether any interloping absorption lines from other redshift systems may be present within any of the spectral regions used to measure a . When interloper parameters are introduced , degeneracy can occur with other parameters associated with the metal lines used to measure a . To avoid this problem , all previous parameters are temporarily fixed , and gvpfit is used in a first pass to identify places in the data where the current model is inadequate . Interlopers , modeled as unidentified atomic species , are added automatically by gvpfit to improve the current fit . <p> In stage 4 , the model resulting from this third stage is used as the input model for the fourth and final part of the process , which entails running gvpfit again but this time with all parameters free to vary ( subject to the physical constraint that all b parameters are tied , and all redshifts of corresponding absorbing components are tied , as was the case throughout all stages ) . <h> RESULTS <p> In previous non -- artificial intelligence ( AI ) analyses , the general approach was to construct absorption system models based on turbulent broadening ( 30 ) and then to build a thermal model from the turbulent parameters . One important advantage of the AI approach is that it is straightforward to construct turbulent and thermal models independently , and this has been done for all four absorption systems reported here . While this was possible before gvpfit automation , it was very time consuming to do manually and therefore was generally not done . The Doppler or b parameters of different ionic species are related by bi2=2kT/mi+bturb2 , where the ith ionic species has mass m , k is Boltzmann 's constant , and T is the temperature of the absorption cloud . The first term describes the thermal contribution to the broadening of the b parameters , and the second term describes the contribution of bulk , turbulent motions . If the linewidths for a particular absorption cloud are dominated by thermal broadening , the second term of the equation is zero and vice versa if the broadening mechanism is predominantly turbulent . These two cases are the limits of possibilities for the values of the b parameters . <p> We have modeled each absorption system using the two limiting cases : first assuming that the lines are thermally broadened and then assuming turbulent broadening . Modeling in this way results in two measurements of the fine-structure constant for each absorption system . Table 2 gives the results , which show that both measurements , for all four absorption systems , are consistent with each other . Rather than discarding the highest ? 2 model , since both models are statistically acceptable , we give a single value of a from our results using the method of moments estimator to determine the most likely value . The method of moments estimator compares the weighted relative goodness-of-fit differences between the thermal and turbulent models . This method is conservative , in that it only ever increases the uncertainty estimate on a from the smallest one and accounts for cases where the fits are consistent ( like our results ) , and where inconsistent , the value chosen is more heavily weighted to the model with a lower ? 2 see ( 30 ) . <p> Table 2Summary of final results . <p> The ? a/a values given here have all been corrected for a nominal wavelength distortion , i.e. , each value corresponds to the minimum ? 2 in fig . S8 . Uncertainties in the thermal and turbulent columns are derived from the covariance matrix ( inverse Hessian ) diagonal terms . The final column combines the thermal and turbulent values using the method of moments and also includes an estimated systematic error component associated with possible long-range wavelength distortions ( although the evidence for a distortion was not statistically significant ) . Note that , even if present , the contribution of any distortion to the overall ? a/a error budget is small . This is because of the large wavelength coverage of x-shooter and because the distortion model parameters were derived from a simultaneous fit to all transitions in all four absorption systems . <p> Figure 1 illustrates one model for the lowest-redshift system analyzed ( see caption for details ) . All final model parameters associated with the four high-redshift absorption systems modeled here are provided in the Supplementary Materials , which also provides information relating to upper limits on potential systematic effects due to wavelength distortions . This is the first time multiple absorption systems along a given sightline have been simultaneously modeled to constrain the presence and impact of long-range wavelength distortions across a large wavelength range . This is important because in this way , the distortion model parameters are more tightly constrained , and hence , the possible additional systematic error on ? a/a is minimized . We find that in this case , the additional systematic is smaller than the statistical uncertainty on ? a/a . <p> The model shown is the thermal fit . In all fits , model profiles included isotopic structures assuming relative terrestrial abundances for all species . Individual absorption components are illustrated by the thinner continuous orange lines . The gray line near the bottom of each panel shows the 1s uncertainty on each spectral pixel . The upper black histogram illustrates the normalized residuals . The horizontal red dotted line is a reference line ( arbitrarily offset for clarity ) representing the expected mean of zero for the normalized residuals . The horizontal red continuous lines illustrate the expected 1s deviations . Components labeled "" a "" and "" b "" indicate reference transitions , and uppercase letters "" A "" and "" B "" indicate parameters tied to the reference transitions ( **35;7615;TOOLONG ) . Where cosmic rays have fallen on the quasar spectrum , pixels have been clipped ( as can be seen by the gaps in the black histograms ) . The Mg II 2796 line fell in a region of the spectrum with an incompletely removed telluric line so was excluded from the fitting process . Plots for the other many-multiplet absorption systems observed in this spectrum are provided in the Supplementary Materials . <p> The x-shooter spectral resolution may not resolve individual absorbing components . However , we simultaneously fit multiple transitions at the same redshift , with tied parameter constraints , such that the Voigt profile parameters and a measurements are reasonably well constrained . Nevertheless , the lower spectral resolution of x-shooter compared to echelle spectrographs such as UVES ( Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph ) and HIRES ( High-Resolution Echelle Spectrometer ) would lead us to expect that some absorption components are missed . In a small number of cases , elevated b parameters in the final models reinforce that expectation ( full model parameter details and estimated uncertainties for all four absorption systems are provided via the Supplementary Materials ) . Even so , Fig. 2 indicates that a is likely to be insensitive to missing components because a stabilizes in relatively early model generations and subsequently varies only slightly as model complexity increases . The same insensitivity of a to missing components was borne out in the numerically simulated spectral simulations described in ( 55 ) . The impact of subsequent higher spectral resolution would evidently reduce the ? a/a error bar , but the x-shooter results presented here should not be systematically biased by the lower resolution . <p> Fig. 2Illustration of the gvpfit procedures used in obtaining the ? a/a measurement for the zabs = 5.50726 absorption system . <p> The four fitting stages are indicated by the four different shaded regions ( stage 1 : consistent structure required ; stage 2 : consistent structure requirement removed ; stage 3 : find interlopers ; stage 4 : final tied parameter fit ; see text for details ) . Each point illustrates the lowest ? 2 point at each generation . Model complexity increases with generation number . The error bars are artificially small in stage 3 because some parameters were fixed during the initial interloper fit . The red point in each stage indicates the model with the smallest AICc for that stage . The continuous black line illustrates the AICc . The final model for this system is indicated by the red point at generation 32 in stage 4 . The "" plateauing "" of points within each stage occurs simply because this absorption system is relatively simple , with only two components , such that when gvpfit attempts to insert additional components at various trial positions within the absorbing region , the AICc value always increases , and that model is thus rejected . <p> The fine-structure constant has been measured in four high-redshift absorption systems using an x-shooter spectrum of the zem = 7.084 quasar J1120+0641 . These four measurements are the highest-redshift direct measurements of a to date . The final results are summarized in Table 2 , giving both statistical and systematic parameter uncertainties . The weighted mean value of a is consistent with the terrestrial value and is ? a/a = - 2.18 ? 7.27 ? 10-5 . <h> DISCUSSION <p> Our analysis compares relative shifts between atomic species and therefore directly tests for any possible change in a . No molecular species have been used . We thus have no sensitivity to changes in the proton-to-electron mass ratio , ? = mp/me or combinations of constants such as a2 ? and a2gp/ ? ; hence , no model-dependent coupling constant assumptions have been necessary . <p> To update the parameters associated with the spatial dipole discussed in ( 42,30 ) , we form a new combined sample of a measurements as follows : <p> Where measurements reported in ( 58 ) were reanalyses of the same systems from ( 30 ) , the former was used . Error bars include systematic contributions ( although we note the heterogeneous nature of this combined dataset and point out that systematic errors were not all estimated in a consistent manner so error bars are not necessarily directly comparable in all cases ) . The point in black at z = 5.87 illustrates the weighted mean of the four measurements described in this paper . Its horizontal bar indicates the redshift range spanned by those four measurements . The red shaded area shows the redshift range from the quasar emission redshift ( zem = 7.085 ) down to the lowest possible redshift for a ? a/a measurement ( zabs = 5.443 ) , assuming that we retain the lowest rest-wavelength anchor line , Si II 1526 ? ? . Ga , billion years . <p> Using the bootstrap method described in ( 30 ) to estimate statistical significance , this deviates from a null result at a level of 3.9s . We can also directly compare the dipole model prediction ( using the new parameters above ) with the actual weighted mean from the four new x-shooter measurements : The dipole prediction for the weighted mean is ? a/a = - 0.19 ? 10-5 , in agreement with the actual measurement of ? a/a = - 2.18 ? 7.27 ? 10-5 . <p> The x-shooter data presented here highlight an important benefit that is generally not available with higher-resolution echelle spectra of quasars : The extended wavelength coverage increases our ability to detect absorption systems along the line of sight simply because more transitions at the same redshift appear . Systems that might otherwise remain undiscovered or uncertain become clear . This is important because potential blends in transitions of interest are revealed ( Table 1 ) , and hence , systematic effects on the measurement of a that those blends may cause can be accounted for . A second advantage of the extended x-shooter wavelength coverage is that since there are more transitions falling within the observed spectral range , a more stringent constraint on ? a/a is achieved . Ultimately , the precision of the very high redshift measurements reported in this paper will be improved by obtaining higher spectral resolution using new instrumentation such as HIRES on the ELT ( Extremely Large Telescope ) . <h> MATERIALS AND METHODS <h> Observations and data reduction <p> Observations of the quasar J1120+0641 were obtained using the x-shooter spectrograph on the European Observatory 's VLT . The total integration time was 30 hours spanning a period from March 2011 to April 2014 ( European Southern Observatory programs 286 . A-5025 , 089 . A-0814 , and 093 . A-0707 ) . All exposures were taken with slit widths of 0.9 arc sec for the visual ( vis ) and near-infrared ( nir ) arms of the x-shooter spectrograph , giving spectral resolutions of R = ? / ? ? = 7450 and 5300 , respectively . However , inspection of telluric absorption lines indicate a higher spectral resolution , suggesting that the atmospheric seeing was better than the slit width used . Atmospheric absorption lines were measured as having an R ? 10,000 for the vis arm and R ? 7000 for the nir arm , consistent with a seeing full width at half maximum ? 0.7 arc sec . These values are consistent with the more detailed discussion about x-shooter resolution given in ( 59 ) . The total wavelength coverage is approximately 5505 to 22,740 ? . The spectral signal-to-noise varies across the spectrum and is approximately 21 per 10 km s-1 pixel at 11,191 ? . <p> Data reduction was performed using custom Interactive Data Language ( IDL ) routines . The procedures include flat fielding of the exposures and sky subtraction using the optimal extraction method as described in ( 60 ) . The extracted one-dimensional spectra , rebinned to 10 km s-1 pixels , were flux-calibrated using response curves derived from standard stars . Absolute flux calibration was performed by scaling the corrected spectrum to match the VLT/ Focal Reducer and Low Dispersion Spectrograph 2 ( FORS2 ) and Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph ( GNIRS ) on the Gemini North Telescope spectra of J1120+0641 obtained by Mortlock et al . ( 48 ) . Atmospheric line removal was performed using SkyCalc atmospheric transmission models ( **44;7652;TOOLONG ... A comprehensive description of the observations and data reduction is given in ( 51 ) . <h> Continuum fitting <p> Before profile fitting the absorption systems of interest , we need a reliable estimate of the unabsorbed quasar continuum . This was obtained using the iraf ( http : **28;7698;TOOLONG ) task continuum . Small spectral regions flanking each absorption line were selected , and the pixels containing absorption were masked . The spectral regions used to estimate the underlying continuum ( by fitting cubic splines , typically of order 3 ) each contained 100 to 300 pixels . <h> Identification of absorption systems <p> Identification of absorption systems and atomic species present was carried out using qscan ( 61 ) , an interactive Python program to display the spectrum on a velocity scale such that transitions occurring at the same redshift align visually in velocity space . The spectral ranges chosen for fitting were selected as described in ( 58 ) . Eleven absorption systems were detected ( Table 1 ) . Of these 11 , 4 were selected for their sensitivity to fine-structure constant variation : zabs = 7.05852 , zabs = 6.17097 , zabs = 5.95074 , and zabs = 5.50793 . We excluded Si IV and C IV in the determination of a in the three latter systems as the ionization potentials of these transitions are significantly higher than the other ( more sensitive ) transitions available . Mg II 2796 in absorption system at zabs = 5.50794 falls in a region of the spectrum containing an incompletely removed telluric line and was not included in the modeling . For the highest-redshift system , zabs = 7.059 , only high-ionization species were available . The lower sensitivity of these results in a substantially larger error on a but including the system has the advantage of producing a tighter constraint on any possible long-range distortion in the spectrum , hence improving the overall result . <h> Atomic data and sensitivity coefficients <p> We used multiplets from different atomic species simultaneously to constrain any possible variation of the fine-structure constant a . The method used , the Many-Multiplet Method , was introduced in ( 28 , 38 ) . Sensitivity coefficients ( q coefficients , parameterizing the sensitivity of an observed wavelength to variation of the fine-structure constant ) are compiled in ( 62 ) along with laboratory wavelengths , oscillator strengths , and hyperfine structure and spontaneous emission rates ( G values ) . The large nonordered range in q coefficients and their different signs create a unique varying a signature and assist in overcoming simple systematic effects . Figure 4 shows how the transition wavelengths of Si II , Al II , Fe II , and Mg II ( the transitions used in this analysis ) depend on a . The range in a is exaggerated for illustration . <p> Fig. 4Illustration of the a dependence of the transitions observed in the four absorption systems measured in this paper . <p> The percentage change in a covers an unrealistically large range to show the shift trends . The lower x axis is rest wavelength , and the upper is the observed-frame wavelength at redshift z = 5.87 ( the mean redshift for all three absorption systems in this analysis ) . Some transitions ( Si II 1526 ? , Al II 1670 ? , and Mg II 2796/2803 ? ) are insensitive to changes in a ( "" anchors "" ) , while the Fe II transitions all show a substantially greater sensitivity , with Fe II 1608 ? shifting in the opposite direction to Fe II 2344 , 2383 , 2586 , and 2600 ? . The sensitivity of an observed frequency ? z at redshift z to a change in a is given by ? z= ? 0+q(az2/a02-1) ? 2da/a , where a0 and ? 0 are the terrestrial values and q is the sensitivity coefficient for that transition . <h> Further details and final model adjustments <p> The gvpft modeling produces near-final fits , but additional physical considerations , not coded into the AI methodology , are helpful in deriving the final absorption line models . These relatively minor tweaks to the nonlinear least-squares input-guess parameters were done ( i ) to remove or minimize the presence of parameters that are physically implausible and ( ii ) to further improve the model by reducing the overall ? 2 . The notes here record those considerations and justify final model parameters . <p> zabs = 5.507261 . No changes to the gvpfit models were required . The following discussion applies to both the thermal and the turbulent fits . <p> The gvpfit model for this system included an interloper at approximately +100 km s-1 in Fe II 2600 ? ( see Fig. 1 ) for which the column density and b parameter were poorly constrained . Removing this interloper resulted in a negligible change to either the overall ? 2 or any of the remaining model parameters , so the interloper has been excluded . <p> Visual inspection shows a very broad shallow continuum depression over the Fe II 2600- ? absorption line at approximately -80 km s-1 , as Fig. 1 illustrates . gvpfit modeled this using a high-b component ( b = 81 km s-1 ) straddling the whole absorption complex . There is no species identification for this interloper . It may be due to real unidentified absorption or it may be some observational artifact . The associated degeneracy in the final model due to these additional parameters is minimal and affects negligibly on the other model parameters . <p> zabs = 5.950744 . Thermal fit : The Mg II lines reveal three components . The gvpfit model found an interloper heavily blended with the left-hand Mg II component at approximately -20 km s-1 . Cosmic ray events on the detector spoil the Fe II lines in this region , so the leftmost component provides only a very weak constraint on ? a/a , which is thus constrained almost entirely by the right-hand component at +75 km s-1 . Once the initial model fits were available , it became apparent that several pixels in the Mg II 2796- and 2803- ? lines were significantly deviant . We assumed that this was due to weak cosmic rays contaminating the spectrum . We thus manually clipped three pixels in the 2796- ? line and two pixels in the 2803- ? line , as can be seen in fig . S2 . <p> Turbulent fit : The independently derived turbulent model found by gvpfit differs to the thermal model in that no interloper was assigned to the leftmost Mg II component . While this makes the model rather different to the thermal one , the impact on ? a/a and its uncertainty is minimal , and both thermal and turbulent models yield a consistent result for ? a/a . <p> zabs = 6.170969 . No changes to the gvpfit model were made for this absorption system . This absorption system was modeled by gvpfit as single component . The b parameters for the transitions seen in this system are comparable with those found when modeling higher-resolution data . No interlopers were identified . <p> zabs = 7.058521 .

"<h> Elon Musk sets update on brain-computer interface company Neuralink for August 28 <p> Elon Musk said on Twitter this week that Neuralink , the company he founded in 2016 to develop computer-brain interfaces for the explicit purpose of helping humans keep pace with advanced artificial intelligence , will provide an update on its progress on August 28 . The last major update from Neuralink came roughly a year ago , when it shared that it will be using a surgical robot to implant gossamer-thin wires into a person 's brain , connected to an external computer processing unit , and that ultimately it hopes to make the connection wireless between the two for maximum freedom and flexibility . <p> Neuralink revealed in July 2019 that it had already performed successful tests of its technology on mice and even apes , and that it would be pursuing testing on its first human subjects starting as early as the following year -- which is this year , 2020 , if you 're keeping track . <p> Co-founded by Musk and led by CEO Jared Birchall , Neuralink is headquartered in San Francisco and has been conducting research in partnership with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use its technology to help mitigate the effects of neurological disorders in patients with severe impacts to mobility and other daily functioning , but ultimately the company also hopes to use its technology to essentially "" upgrade "" humans to be able to interact with computing devices at the speed of thought . <p> Musk has consistently pointed out how "" lossy "" the process of translating thought to input via conventional means including keyboard and mouse is , and believes that a tighter , more high-fidelity bond between people and computers can help decrease the risk that advanced AI surpasses the capabilities of human intelligence . Musk has stated on a number of occasions that he believes uncontrolled , unregulated advanced general artificial intelligence poses an existential risk to humanity , and Neuralink is intended to be a means of protection against that threat . <p> We do n't yet know what Musk and Neuralink will be sharing about the company 's progress since its last update in 2019 , but hopefully we 'll hear something about its plans to begin human trials .

"" <p> On the Fourth of July , Kanye West lit up Twitter with an announcement : He is running for president in the 2020 election . Although the rapper has been vocal about his plans to run in 2024 , no one expected him to make a play for the Oval Office this late into the election . But alas , here we are . In an interview with Forbes , West detailed his presidential plans and running platforms , including protecting America in whatever foreign policy he pursues , implementing the "" framework of Wakanda "" as a management model , and having serious reservations about a coronavirus vaccine . "" It 's so many of our children that are being vaccinated and paralyzed ... So when they say the way we 're going to fix Covid is with a vaccine , I 'm extremely cautious , "" West told Forbes . "" That 's the mark of the beast . They want to put chips inside of us . "" But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run itself , is West 's party affiliation for 2020 . Although West said he intended to run as the Republican candidate if Donald Trump was n't the incumbent , he is now running under a different party : the "" Birthday Party . "" Even though , according to West , he only registered to vote earlier this week , he has publicly supported Trump and many Republican party ideals in recent years . Not much is known about the Birthday Party and what it supports other than the beliefs West espoused in the interview and that it came about through the guidance of Elon Musk and Michelle Tidball , a preacher from Wyoming who will run with West as vice president . But why the Birthday Party ? "" Because when we win , it 's everybody 's birthday , "" West told Forbes . "" I do n't like that I caught wind that he hid in a bunker , "" West said of Trump when asked about his decision to run . Even with his lost faith in Trump , many are wondering if it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the game , and under this "" party . "" Technically it is possible , though the details around it are questionable . He can not run as a Democrat or Republican because both parties have put forth candidates , with Joe Biden as the presumed Democratic nominee and Donald Trump running for a second term . However , the option to run as an Independent -- or under an Independent party name -- still stands , so long as filing deadlines have no passed . But some deadlines to run have passed in multiple states including Texas , New Mexico , Indiana , Maine , and North Carolina . The deadline for the majority of other states is in August , which gives West a short window to get everything together . In order to get on the ballot as an independent , West would also need to quickly gather tens of thousands of signatures from across the country to qualify . Each state has specific requirements for prospective candidates to gain what is known as "" ballot access . "" To run as an Independent , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands , lot of hoops need to be jumped through before someone can see their name on the ballot . But this does n't come as much of a surprise late in the game , nor does West 's conviction to run for president in 2020 . West 's sudden bid for the presidency is , at least in talk , years in the making . At the 2015 VMAs , West referenced his future campaign while accepting the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award . "" And yes , as you probably could have guessed by this moment , I have decided in 2020 to run for president , "" said West before exiting the stage.Like what you see ?

"<h> Africa embraces cloud even as security fears persist <p> For African IT decision-makers , security remains the single biggest concern of being in the cloud , particularly amid the latest spate of data breaches . <p> This is one of the findings in the latest "" Cloud in Africa 2020 "" report , compiled by World Wide Worx in partnership with F5 , Dell Technologies , Digicloud Africa and Intel . <p> World Wide Worx interviewed IT decision-makers , primarily IT managers , across 400 medium and large enterprises in South Africa , Kenya , Zambia , Nigeria , Zimbabwe , Namibia , Botswana and Malawi , to ascertain current and intended use of cloud technologies in the continent 's major markets . <p> Arthur Goldstuck , World Wide Worx MD and lead analyst on the project , says these latest findings mirror that of the first cloud in Africa report from seven years ago . <p> However , security back then was more of a concern preventing organisations from moving into the cloud , while today it 's a concern of being in the cloud because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 63% of the survey respondents cited data security or breach of data as their main concern , mainly because they see it happening around them , reveals Goldstuck . <h> See also <p> "" Following security , compliance , data integrity and policy consistency are cited by little more than one in 10 respondents . One in 10 is tiny ; aside from security there are n't too many concerns about being in the cloud . "" <p> South Africa , whose cloud computing space has witnessed considerable growth in recent months , with international public cloud service providers Amazon Web Services and Microsoft having established data centres in the country , has witnessed an increase in data breaches . <p> South African companies that recently suffered data breaches include Experian and Momentum Metropolitan . In June , Life Healthcare Group , the second largest private hospital operator in the country , was hit by a cyber attack in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak . <p> In February , big four bank Nedbank warned that the information of about 1.7 million clients was potentially affected by a data breach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omnia Holdings said its IT infrastructure was subject to a cyber attack . <p> Even though there are security concerns , there are benefits to being in the cloud , as the respondents ' feedback shows . <p> Forty percent of respondents believe that cloud computing has had a direct , positive impact on market share in the past two years . <p> The single biggest benefit cited by respondents is business efficiency ( 63% ) , followed by agility and operational flexibility ( 53% ) , and improved customer service ( 45% ) . Improved time-to-market was also an important outcome for over a third of respondents ( 37% ) . <p> "" Since the pandemic , the will of leaders to change at pace has increased by an order of magnitude . The situation has clearly proved that this type of rapid adaptation is possible and , crucially , that businesses can thrive in the cloud . "" <h> Cloud driver <p> The survey respondents stated the COVID-19 pandemic pushed cloud computing to front of mind , with 91% regarding it as an important resource for coping with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the technology platform has been used primarily for disaster recovery ( 91% ) and remote working ( 82% ) , followed by customer service activities ( 52% ) , the survey shows . <p> Furthermore , eight out of 10 respondents ( 80% ) believe that cloud computing has made a significant contribution to governments ' efforts in dealing with the pandemic . The most common uses by governments were remote working ( 69% ) , public communications ( 55% ) and crisis coordination ( 50% ) . <p> During this time , historic perceptions of cloud being costly and risky have also largely dissipated . As many as 84% of respondents now believe cloud computing is cost-effective and only 12% regard it as inherently risky . <p> From 2018 onwards , most African businesses are in the cloud as opposed to evolving towards the cloud , according to Goldstuck . "" COVID-19 has clearly catalysed decision-makers ' receptivity to the cloud in recent months , but a significant momentum was already building across Africa . <p> "" The transition to digital channels will likely continue beyond the pandemic as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , it is prompting different architectural solutions for expansion , such as cloud bursting and augmenting on-premises deployments with virtual appliances . "" <p> In regards to expected tech trends , the three most important for future strategy , each cited by nine out of 10 respondents , are artificial intelligence ( AI ) and machine learning , Internet of things ( IOT ) , and big data . <p> While we are not there yet , it is very clear that AI , IOT and big data will be driving technology use across the continent in the coming years , notes Goldstuck . <p> Arthur Goldstuck , head of World Wide Worx . <p> Spending gains <p> In terms of spending on cloud , the report shows that 38% of decision-makers increased their cloud services spend last year . <p> South Africa led the way , with 82% of the respondents stating they had increased cloud spend , followed by 59% in Zimbabwe , and 50% in both Nigeria and Botswana . <p> "" The high 59% for Zimbabwe has much to do with its location close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major data centres in SA . This will be a feature of cloud in Africa , "" notes Goldstuck . <p> According to World Wide Worx , cloud investment is also growing as a percentage of overall IT budgets , particularly in countries with traditionally less mature IT markets . <p> For 71% of Zambian respondents , between a quarter and half of their IT budgets are allocated to the cloud . For Zimbabwe and Malawi , it is 59% and 56% , respectively . In Namibia , 65% said more than half of IT budgets were focused on cloud . In Botswana , 14% reported that 100% of budgets went to cloud-related IT . <p> Meanwhile , in SA , 45% of decision-makers indicated that cloud accounted for less than a quarter of IT budgets , 34% said it was between a quarter and half , and 11% put it above three-quarters . <p> The report states : "" In 2021 , almost two-thirds ( 61% ) of all respondents are set to increase investments in cloud services , 36% expect investment to remain at current levels , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of all respondents ( 56% ) estimate that over a quarter of applications will have moved to the cloud by the end of this year .

There were some really exciting innovations coming out -- everything from physical products being manufactured to the gaming industry and artificial intelligence . <p> Dunedin was a city with an amazing lifestyle and creative culture so it was a great place for a creative , enthusiastic entrepreneur to live , she said . <p> It also had engagement from the Dunedin City Council , University of Otago and Otago Polytechnic and the access to business leaders was unrivalled ; key people regularly donated their time to mentor and push the city forward .

The former two were really only accessible to a small number of extremely high net worth individuals , and the latter were subject to sharemarket fluctuations , which , she believed , made them more like an equity than a property investment . <p> It was a good team of people , led by Scott McKenzie , who happened to be one of her husband Alex 's best friends from John McGlashan College . <p> He wanted to see PMG at least double in funds under management over the next two years , and the opportunity to be instrumental in that growth and to bring a new company to Dunedin excited her . <p> She had also kept the Immersion branding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She saw that as the fruition of her long-term dream to found her own private equity fund , investing in high growth ideas and companies from around the country , with a focus on Otago . <p> The strategy was that Immersion Ventures would take on several investments each year , with a focus on ideas that had some synergies with property , manufacturing and/or marketing . <p> Mr and Mrs Ramsay own United Machinists where there was a "" bit of a growth strategy in play "" .

If you 're a local totally peeved at the amount of attention which the Summit attracts -- attention which no other Irish tech event ever attracts from non-tech media -- you just want it all over as fast as possible . <p> In my case , I 'm always keen to hear interesting speakers talk the talk on a wide range of topics and I had that within 10 minutes of stepping off the DART in Sandymount . David Epstein provided the opening talking on the Sports Summit stage and his fantastic presentation rolled from the 0.5 per cent difference between legendary and needing an off-season job to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle . <p> Over the two days I was there ( I could n't make it on Thursday so unfortunately missed all the Music Summit programming ) , I heard a rake of fantastic talks , panel discussions and presentations . Be it Robert Muggah 's on how crime cartels are using social media , Gary Marcus on artificial intelligence , a surprisingly self-aware Rio Ferdinand on footballers and Twitter and a score of fascinating discussions on sports agents and data , the Summit delivered for me in this regard . Like many , I hope all the panels were recorded for future podcast or broadcast and that 's certainly another revenue stream which could be tapped by the organisers . <p> Such was the size of Web Summit 2014 , there was absolutely no way you could get to everything . With stages running simultaneously in two different locations and not one tech start-up offering bi-location or cloning services , you just could n't get to everything . I made a decision to largely ignore all the main stage stuff because there was way too much boring guff there last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was just as much guff in 2014 . We really do n't need David Carr and co talking yet again about the future of the media when the future of the media is actually happening right now . Time to perhaps address the present of the media than pick some belly fluff about what may never happen . <p> No , the real discussions and insights , as is often the case , could be found off-Broadway and away from the main drag . Those smaller stages , which were evidently carefully curated and programmed , worked like gangbusters and gave those who wanted something other than webtrepreneurs pitching their wares something to dig . Of course , they did n't have any of the big bells and whistles which many people associate with the Web Summit -- you did n't get Enda Kenny spending any time at the Library Stage and more 's the pity -- but they provided some very important elements nonetheless . Indeed , if you stayed away from the main stage area in the Simmonscourt pavilion , you also got decent wi-fi all during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But the Web Summit for the mainstream is all about the big hitters , like sight of Eva Longoria walking , tweeting and eating her weight in crisps around Dublin . That 's the shorthand about the Summit for many , a couple of days of distractions , some celebrities , media outlets which rarely cover tech in any indepth or insightful way falling over themselves to do the Summit , social media snarking and occasional discombobulation when a few pubs or streets are taken over by tech lads in their blazers and carefully pressed jeans . By and large , the Summit sticks to its RDS acres and , while there is a commendable intention to bring the Summit around the city , most Dubliners could -- and probably did -- have avoided the whole thing last week . That 's where it differs with a bona-fide monster event like SXSW which totally takes over Austin , Texas for 10 days . <p> Yet you got the sense this year that the Summit is still only getting started . While it may have seemed that it jumped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's a massive achievement to have reached 20,000 delegates after five years , but Cosgrave 's comments in the closing press conference about the event getting bigger should not be dismissed out of hand . You could easily envisage several new strands next year . What a Farm Summit to go beyond just the artisan producers feted in the Food Summit ? The after-hours ' Students Summit was a huge success so there 's scope for growth there . A Creative Summit ? A Design Summit ? A Fashion Summit ? A Summit Summit for those who organise summits ? There are plenty of sheds and empty buildings in the RDS which could yet be pressed into service . <p> One small request would be a greater tie-in between the event and the city . Despite all the wi-fi problems and posturing over same ( Ireland is not yet the best small country in the world to connect to the internet in ) , it 's highly unlikely that the Summit is leaving the capital any time soon , given how difficult it would be to get a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make sense for the Summit to get a little closer to the city they call home . <p> The Summit made a clever move by ensuring that the Summit Fringe events are under their umbrella , but there 's plenty of scope for much more city-wide programming than was the case this year . After all , most of the speakers who 've had their transport and hotel costs covered would be more than willing to do more than one 20 minute panel or talk . If the organisers do n't do it or are worried about diluting the main offering , expect much more guerilla events to pop up in 2015 as independent organisers tap those speakers already in town . A Web Summit ticket is expensive for a reason because you 're getting access to all those speakers and talks , but that does n't mean the Summit should n't and could n't do more for the city with fringe programming . Call it a goodwill gesture . <p> Overall , then , it 's thumbs up from this quarter . Sure , there are still problems and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the connectivity to the gender ratio of the speakers to the lack of really strong discussions on the main stage , are within the control of the organisers -- but they got so much right this year that it would be churlish not to acknowledge what they 've done . Growing a festival from zero to 20,000 within five years is a significant achievement which deserves a round of appluase . Putting on an event like this in Dublin and drawing that sort and size of crowd also calls for an ovation . It will be fascinating to see where Cosgrave and Web Summit go from here because they 've set the bar very high after this year 's fandango . <h> Forgot Password ? <h> Thank you <p> You should receive instructions for resetting your password .

"<h> Oasis Diagnostics(R) and NYU College of Dentistry Announce the North American Saliva Symposium <p> VANCOUVER , WA-- ( Marketwired - October 19 , 2016 ) - Oasis Diagnostics ? , an innovative biotechnology company focused on developing cutting edge tools for saliva sample acquisition and testing , announced that it will be co-hosting the annual North American Saliva Symposium ( NASS ) with the prestigious New York University College of Dentistry , in New York City , from December 9th through the 11th , 2016 <p> This marks the 3rd year that NASS will be providing a stage for the extensive research being conducted on saliva and salivary diagnostics . Hosted by the Linhart Continuing Education Program at New York University College of Dentistry in the heart of midtown Manhattan , the symposium promises to be a major event . The symposium will include presentations from across the spectrum of diagnostics , and New York University 's Dr. John McDevitt , chairman of the Department of Biomaterials at NYU Dentistry , will be discussing his breakthroughs in digital biological sensors . "" The field of salivary diagnostics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biomarker discovery , state-of-the-art digital diagnostic platforms , big data and artificial intelligence are all converging . This convergence is facilitating the arrival of transformative diagnostic modalities with precision medicine capabilities for the masses , "" says Dr. McDevitt . <p> The annual North American Saliva Symposium was a long time concept turned reality in 2014 when CEO Dr. Paul Slowey ( Oasis Diagnostics ? ) was introduced to the idea by neonatologist Jill Maron , MD , MPH ( Associate Professor , Tufts University School of Medicine ) . This initial discussion led the pair to initiate a process that would blossom into a full-fledged meeting that would attract the finest minds in the fields of diagnostics , dentistry , medicine , and other fields . Plenary speaker Dr. David Wong , DMD , DMSc ( University of California , Los Angeles ) , had this to say of the first NASS Conference . "" Wonderful to see the academic science , basic and translational , as well as a strong industrial presence and interests in the clinical maturation of oral fluids for personalized/precision medicine . "" <p> Dr. Wong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hottest topics in the diagnostic world : liquid biopsy . Liquid biopsy is a term coined to describe the analysis of bodily fluids for components that can be used as simple and viable alternatives to traditional tissue biopsy testing for the diagnosis of diseases , including cancers , diabetes , and others . While many have turned to blood samples for their liquid biopsy , Dr. Wong instead uses saliva for its multitude of advantages including rapid collection , simple storage and transportation , cost effectiveness , and , most importantly , clinical performance . <p> The North American Saliva Symposium will see Dr. Wong joined by a cadre of impressive researchers studying Zika Fever ( Dr. Walter Siqueira , University of Western Ontario ) , Programmable Digital Biological Diagnostics ( Dr. John McDevitt , NYU College of Dentistry ) , Metabolic Syndrome in Children and Adolescents ( Dr. Phil Stashenko , Forsyth Institute ) , and many more . <p> The Conference will also feature a poster / abstract session and opportunities for sponsorship from interested organizations in the field . <p> ABOUT OASIS DIAGNOSTICS ? CORPORATIONOasis Diagnostics ? specializes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that includes an array of devices for the standardized collection of oral fluids and testing of specimens both in the laboratory and at the point-of-care . Currently the company offers the Versi*SAL ? and Super*SAL ? Saliva Collection Devices for standardized oral fluid collection , VerOFy ? , a rapid point-of-care testing platform device , DNA*SAL ? and SimplOFy ? , novel collection tools for the harvesting of DNA from saliva for applications such as PCR , genotyping and genome-wide association studies , Accu*SAL ? , a tool for collection of saliva for abused drug testing and RNAPro*SAL ? and Pure*SAL ? new devices for the simple and non-invasive collection of RNA and proteins , with application in liquid biopsy testing .

"<h> 10 Top New Year 's Resolutions for Success and Happiness in 2020 <h> Studies show that about 60 percent of us make New Year 's resolutions each year--sadly , only about 8 percent of us achieve them . <p> As the New Year fast approaches , it 's natural to feel a bit excited by the prospect of leaving behind the old year and beginning anew . In fact , research shows that about 60 percent of us get so excited by this prospect that we take the time to make New Year 's resolutions ( sadly , only about 8 percent of us actually achieve them ) . <p> Polly is artificial intelligence patented by market research firm Advanced Symbolics Inc. that uses publicly available online information to create representative samples of any population or target audience . Polly looked at what 274,779 Americans said their New Year 's Resolutions were for the past four years to project what the 10 top New Year 's resolutions would be for 2020 . <p> Here , according to Polly , are the 10 top New Year 's resolutions for 2020 : <p> While there are some usual suspects in our findings , what really jumped out for me was the overall trend toward self-care . We are used to seeing things like physical health improvements in New Year 's resolutions , but it looks like in 2020 Americans mostly want to take care of themselves--emotionally , mentally , and physically . They want to better themselves and their situation . <p> So , what are you wishing for in 2020 ? A better-paying job ? A more profitable business ? Better relationships ? Less stress ? Happier , more-engaged employees ?"

"<p> Big banks in South Africa are in a fierce battle to claim the top spot of the biggest and best bank in the country . And now there are several new digital banks that have popped up who want to challenge the hegemony of the big banks . This year there were retrenchments at Nedbank , which can be attributed to an onslaught from smaller , nimbler banks such as Bank Zero , Tyme Bank and Discovery Bank . And now South African regulators approved a bank operating licence for Goldman Sachs , which seeks further expansion in the South African economy . Deputy Group CEO of Absa , Peter Matlare told Biznews that all banks are in transition . -- Linda van Tilburg <p> This coverage of the global conversation on change is brought to you by BrightRock , the first ever needs matched life insurance that changes as your life changes . Absa 's Peter Matlare is with me . Peter let 's start with the changing world of banking , especially in South Africa . I see now Goldman Sachs wants to start a bank in South Africa . How much competition is there for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . The first is that all banks -- globally -- are in transition looking at their traditional platforms and finding different ways to serve customers , so in this new world of digital technology , of artificial intelligence , we are all having to transform ourselves . What advantage the new banks obviously have , is that they do n't have the legacy systems that we start out with or that we have . The advantage we have of course is we have customers as well as a whole range of products and propositions which the new banks might well still have to enter . So , I do n't think it 's an easy walk for anyone in particular , but I also would argue that no single bank is in a position to stand still . There 's a great deal of investment and we at ABSA -- with our separation from Barclays -- have spent a significant amount of money in separating from Barclays , but in that process we digitised a number of platforms across the board and so it 's an inevitability for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share price , what do the movements that we 've seen mean ? <p> I suspect that if you think about the movement -- and it depends on the term through which you look at those movements -- you have an economy that is going through challenging times , which means consumers have challenging times and I would imagine that investors reflect on that and they must say to themselves , well you know what should we expect in terms of results and returns . I never think it 's wise to look at short term movements , you really have to look at the longer term . As our economy comes through the cycle I would imagine that hopefully all the stocks begin to rewrite over a period of time . <p> Is this a cycle ? How do you rate what is going on in South Africa at the moment ? <p> So . Globally . I think we 've all seen that a number of countries have been going through a very difficult cycle . If I look at a number of the countries outside of Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those countries that growth has not always been as robust as it 's anticipated . Why do I start there . Because yes you 're absolutely correct in saying South Africa is going through a very difficult cycle . It 's not peculiar to South Africa . If you were to look at the recent changes in Argentina . You would have seen that that economy is going through a very difficult phase . And many markets that are similar to ours -- Mexico etcetera . So I 'm always cautious about becoming too narrow and inwardly focused about these things . They are global trends . That does n't mean we do n't have to work hard to get out of the cycle . But one ought to keep perspective . <p> Are you happy that the structural reforms that the government is talking about in South Africa will be implemented ? <p> I work on the basis that they 've now laid out the plan and minister Mboweni has been very clear in the briefing sessions this morning , both he and ministers Pandor and Patel put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being made . What they did n't shy away from was where the challenges are . So in the energy sector there are definite challenges . But we 've also been making some progress so we ought not to shy away from it . If you look at the structural reform that needs to take place in the logistics industry in order to bring down the cost of goods being transported from point A to Point B -- whether it 's from farm to port or from manufacturers to ports -- a lot of that work has to take place . If you look at the telecom sector and they talk about what needs to happen in terms of spectrum . So all of those are important things that have changed the direction of the economy . I have never thought that there are simple answers to complex problems and so in this instance , we 've got to see positive movement and hopefully we 'll begin to see that . <p> There was an interesting report that came out this morning from the World Economic Forum about passwords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well not even have a password because people 's passwords are so insecure . Is your industry worried about cybercrime , specifically in South Africa ? <p> I remember looking at a report sometime last year that said there was a time when banks were most worried about compliance and if you look at most financial services organisations around the world , one of the biggest areas that they 've continued to invest in is cyber technology , because it brings with it a new set of risks , or different risks . Certainly , I know the South African banks -- not only South African banks -- have been making significant investments in this area . It 's a reality of the world we live in today . <p> The nice thing about South Africa is that when it came to banking we were able to leapfrog some of the technologies in the world , specifically mobile phones . Africa was actually fast in the adoption of it . What about something like blockchain , is there any future for banking in that ? <p> I would imagine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward to the blockchain related technologies and certainly if you think about that in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and begin to think about what blockchain can do , whether it 's up to a local government level , registry offices etc . So as I say with these things we have to keep our eyes on and apply ourselves to them . Do you want to be at the bleeding edge of technology ? I do n't know . It 's something I struggle with but I certainly know that as these gain momentum , we should n't be far behind . <p> So what do you gain from a meeting like this ? <p> The analogy I 've been using over the last couple of days is I really find this very similar to a watering hole . A watering hole where you go to quench your thirst . To be rejuvenated . You rejuvenate the mind , rejuvenate relationships , you find old friends and you make new friends . You think of things in a very different way . One of the great things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting individuals that help you see things on a horizontal plane and not just on a vertical plane , whether it 's in relation to global warming , whether it 's in relation to financing of entrepreneurs etc . I find it an extraordinary place . You need to apply yourself and be very clear about what to do , otherwise you can wander around and get lost . <p> Thank you so much for speaking to us and thank you for your time .

"<h> Africa must act now on AI or fall behind <p> While artificial intelligence ( AI ) and machine learning continues to be applied in key sectors in Africa including agriculture , retail and manufacture , among others , the continent is not fully exploiting the fact that this technology is being democratised and there is subsequently more access . <p> Experts describe digital services in agriculture is a largely untapped market , one that could be worth over US$2.26-billon . <p> Other statistics being reported include that AI-related investment is expected to triple by 2020 and in 2021 , AI augmentation will create US$2.9-trillion in business value and 6.2 billion hours of worker productivity . <p> In 2018 Gartner identified AI-driven development as one of the top ten strategic technologies for 2019 . The company also classified advanced AI and analytics as among five distinct emerging digital ecosystems and technology trends as part of its Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies . <p> Gartner 's AI business value forecast highlights decision support/augmentation as the largest type of AI by business value-add with the fewest early barriers to adoption . <p> By 2030 , decision support/augmentation will surpass all other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global AI-derived business value , the company explains . <p> Speaking on the sidelines of the 2019 Gartner Symposium/ITxpo in Cape Town this week , Brian Burke , research vice president at Gartner , said African businesses have to grasp the opportunity that AI and machine learning offer , or risk being positioned behind the growth curve . <p> Burke said although these technologies are still on the rise , they will remain truly game-changing for decades to come . <p> "" One of the things that is an anomaly in our surveys around technology adoption in Africa is that machine learning and artificial intelligence rated not a priority in Africa , and I think that that is something that African companies need to wake up to . "" <p> Several companies remain focused on the continent and ready to take advantage of AI , to incorporate this into services and offerings . <p> One example is SAS , a specialist provider of analytics software and solutions . <p> Akesh Lalla has recently taken up the position of country general manager at SAS South Africa and confirmed the company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of its evolved platform SAS Viya to leverage open source and cloud , two trends that continue to impact the analytics space going forward . <p> Lalla stresses that the cloud-native technology is designed to help businesses operationalise their analytics model prior to deployment by enabling them to compare and evaluate analytic models to gage ROI and thereby deploy the right solution at the right place at the right time . <p> It also addresses three challenges within the analytics space , namely data governance and analytics teams working in silos , and the ability to leverage elasticity and agility of cloud technology . <p> "" Now you have the ability to deploy SAS Viya on-premise , cloud and hybrid environments .

"<p> TribLIVE 's Daily and Weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need , right to your inbox . <p> Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and UPMC on Thursday launched a new , global effort they say could speed up the process for testing covid-19 treatments . <p> "" We do n't have the luxury of time , "" Dr. Derek Angus , UPMC chair of critical care , said during a news conference . <p> Multiple covid-19 treatments will be tested in different combinations , including the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine , steroids and medications called immunomodulators that alter the responsiveness of the immune system . <p> There are no drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat covid-19 , the disease caused by the novel coronavirus . While hydroxychloroquine has received a lot of attention lately , Angus said researchers still do n't know if it will be the best treatment . <p> "" I do n't know what will work best , "" Angus said . "" I have personal hope that some of the antivirals will help a little bit , but I think we will also need to help the immune system have a more favorable response . The correct answer is probably going to be a combination of therapies that we have n't even tried . "" <p> The effort builds on a testing method developed by an international team of researchers before the novel coronavirus outbreak . That method , called REMAP-Community Acquired Pneumonia , or REMAP-CAP , was designed to find treatments for severe pneumonia but has since been adapted for evaluating treatments specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2 , the virus that causes covid-19 . <p> Unlike traditional clinical trial testing , this method uses machine learning to track several treatment options simultaneously , allowing doctors to adjust combinations of therapies or to discontinue those that are not effective more efficiently . <p> "" This allows us to always rapidly identify which treatment works best , while keeping the number of patients needed to achieve statistical significance low , "" Angus said . "" It also means we get the best treatment to the most patients right out of the gate . "" <p> This method also could test treatments at a lower cost and using fewer patients , researchers said . <p> The trial conducted at UPMC , called UPMC-REMAP-COVID19 , will open across the 40-hospital UPMC system and will be integrated into the health system 's record system . Any covid-19 patient admitted to a UPMC hospital for treatment will be eligible to participate in the trial . <p> The data also will be connected to the global REMAP-CAP , which will include information collected from covid-19 patients throughout North America , Europe , Australia and New Zealand . <p> Unlike traditional clinical trials , which would test each drug individually , additional drugs will be rolled into this testing system as needed . <p> "" In a pandemic , doctors will not have the time to debate the pros and cons of every possible clinical trial , "" Angus said . "" By building this one-stop solution at the point of care , we are rolling out an approach that can assure that every patient admitted with covid-19 , if they choose to , can be enrolled in the program . "" <p> In addition to receiving the current standard of care , most patients would receive at least one of the experimental treatment options if they choose to enroll in the trial , according to a statement from UPMC . <p> At launch , about 12.5% of participants will be assigned to the placebo arm of the trial . Researchers expect that about 99% of patients will be receiving one or more active therapies within weeks . <p> It 's not yet clear how soon the trial will yield results that show , with certainty , which treatments work best . <p> This will depend on how many patients enroll in the program , Angus said . <p> The design and implementation of the UPMC-REMAP-COVID19 trial is led by Angus and colleagues at Berry Consultants ( Austin , Texas ) , and supported by UPMC Enterprises . <p> You are solely responsible for your comments and by using TribLive.com you agree to our Terms of Service . <p> We moderate comments .

"<p> Point it around a corner and shoot -- and it will hit the target . All you need to do is expose your hands and the rifle . <p> Sounds crazy , but , the US Army 's ENVG-B can do that . <p> But let 's take a step back here . How is this possible ? <p> Increasingly miniaturized sensors and displays mean every rifleman may have a network between their sight and their binoculars , Breaking Defense reported . <p> The Enhanced Night Vision Goggles -- Binocular ( ENVG-B ) look almost analog , like a set of fancy , lightweight binoculars mounted on a helmet . By contrast , traditional night vision goggles are monocular , which limits depth perception . <p> But inside , they are a sophisticated set of sensors , aided by cameras and on-board memory , that incorporate with other networked gear carried into battle , Breaking Defense reported . <p> No longer would they have to look downward to discern information , as they do with present systems . Besides a visual of what is in front of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enemies , and a host of other readings . <p> Also , the new devices would be issued to entire squads rather than two or three members , so that everyone is fighting at the same level of capability , National Defense reported . <p> Instead of a goggle system through a tube , the new system would allow for what the Army calls "" true see-through display "" -- that is , goggles and glasses that include artificial intelligence and machine learning . <p> ENVG-B is still being fielded across the force -- the Army awarded L3 Technologies a three-year , US$391 million contract -- but the Army is already developing a next-gen system , a set of augmented reality targeting goggles -- a militarized Microsoft HoloLens -- known as IVAS . <p> The Army 's also developing an Adaptive Squad Architecture to ensure all the different technologies going on a soldier 's body are compatible , Breaking Defense reported . <p> "" ENVG-B is a system of systems , "" Lynn Bollengier of L3 Harris Technologies said at this week 's "" virtual "" Association of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrated augmented reality aspects from the Nett Warrior tablet , as well as wireless interconnectivity with weapon sights . <p> Sounds like a lot of tech , does n't it . What about good old hand grenades ? Oops , that does n't fit with today 's "" Defense Internet of Things , "" battlefield . <p> All combined , that means a soldier wearing the ENVG-B can look through their binoculars , turn on the camera in their rifle 's sight , and point that sight around a corner to see and shoot , without exposing anything more than their hands or the rifle , Breaking Defense reported . <p> Because the night-vision enhancement initiative would apply to Marines as well , the two services are working closely together and with Special Operations Command to ensure that such systems are acceptable to their missions . <p> "" In the long term , we want improvements and capabilities and are working with the Army and SOCOM ... to see where , we align and leverage with each other , "" said Billy Epperson , the Marine Corps ' infantry weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have representatives from warfighters and operating forces as a voice -- from the beginning all the way to final selection , "" Epperson said . "" The last thing we want to do is field something they absolutely hate and refuse to carry . "" <p> Industry participants who are vying for roles in future night-vision development understand that their main goal is to enable individual soldiers and Marines to see better in the battlefield . <p> "" A key question is , how do you balance performance with soldier load ? "" said Billy Fabian , a former infantry officer in Iraq and now a senior research fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments , a Washington , D.C.-based think tank . <p> "" As our dismounted soldiers get more protection -- body armor , etc. -- as well as advanced optics such as night vision , it adds a lot of weight , "" Fabian told National Defense . <p> The next generation of night-vision technology will address these issues , Fabian believes . Such capabilities would amount to a "" pretty huge step , "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dismounted soldier and Marine more lethal and survivable . "" <p> One example of this on display at AUSA was a picture-in-picture display . <p> While still allowing the soldier 40 degrees of horizontal and vertical visibility , the ENVG-B binoculars could incorporate a small , picture-in-picture image from a second source , Breaking Defense reported . <p> "" Any info that can make it to a tactical radio , as long as that 's in Nett Warrior , can be populated into the picture-in-picture mode in the video , "" said Bollengier . <p> The most immediate uses of this feature would be live video from other cameras on the battlefield , including those carried by planes , drones , or other sensor-rich vehicles , Breaking Defense reported . <p> Another possibility is that a soldier could upload a complete 3D model of the hill they are fighting around , drawn from the Army 's One World Terrain database . <p> While originally designed for training , One World Terrain is designed to be a comprehensive 3D map of the entire world , shared in a common library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Again , it sounds more like a video game , than a grunt up the hill , to destroy the pillbox . <p> The primary challenge , the Army says , will be maintaining that connectivity and making sense of the information as it arrives .

"<h> Techie Tuesday From working on Google 's search platform to co-founding Dunzo - the journey of Mukund Jha <p> This week , we feature Co-founder and CTO of Google-backed Dunzo Mukund Jha , who believes the best part of technology is the possibilities . He also talks about the need for techies to keep experimenting . <p> Mukund Jha has been coding for a long time now , since his early childhood to be precise . The Co-founder and CTO of Dunzo says today he codes close to five hours in a week . But he still spends a majority of his time debugging , which he sees as a puzzle waiting to be unravelled . <p> "" Something is going wrong somewhere and there are too many variables on how to zero in on what the problem is . That is what makes debugging fun , "" says Mukund . <p> From building Google 's ' Education for All ' platform to starting up many times , Mukund believes a healthy mix of impatience and laziness can go a long way for an engineer . <p> "" It is only then you want to keep building to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mukund . <p> And this interest in building something to turn things around was a lead-up to something bigger -- Dunzo , a hyperlocal delivery platform , which is the first company to be backed by Google . <p> At Dunzo , Mukund has been responsible for taking the product from its initial WhatsApp days to a complete working prototype to what it is today . He works closely behind every possible variable needed to get a task done on the hyperlocal delivery platform with least human intervention . <p> From fetching something you forgot at home to asking for a pickup and drop , Dunzo makes use of artificial intelligence to manage customers ' tasks . <p> "" We are also looking at setting up Dunzo Essential Stores , which makes delivery easier and helps us get to handle different variables , "" says Mukund . <p> Mukund explains that the reason why Dunzo was able to scale is because they focused on building a strong base . <p> In a conversation with YourStory , Mukund talks about how he got hooked to coding and programming early , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charts his journey of transforming Dunzo from a chat-based product to focusing on the supply side . <h> From a game to C++ <p> Born in Chandigarh , Mukund 's father was an electrical engineer and his mother a homemaker . Though his father had a difficult childhood due to his family conditions , he nonetheless triumphed and got into IIT Kanpur . <p> Mukund says this changed his life completely . <p> "" My love for engineering came from my father , "" says Mukund . <p> A programmer since the age of 10 , Mukund started coding early with C++ when his father got him and his brother a programming CD instead of a game . <p> In the late 90s , when the internet was gaining popularity , Mukund and his brother , who were in their pre-teens , would spend most of their time at internet caf ? s and chat rooms , playing games . <p> "" Initially , we would play a lot of games , and do lot of projects in terms of navigation and Corel Draw . While the 10-year-old me was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , I know that is what hooked me to coding and programming . I could n't stop after that ; I had to keep experimenting . It was fascinating , right from a calculator to a game , you could make anything of your own , "" Mukund says . <h> A successful swap <p> Despite his early interest in coding , Mukund does n't call himself a model student , at least while he was in school . While he was good at academics , Mukund says he was a ' rowdy ' student . <p> "" I would bunk school and go watch movies . I was even suspended from school . I was n't really serious , and was more focused on general teenager stuff , "" he recollects . <p> But he worked his way up and got admitted to NIT Allahabad , where he chose to study electrical engineering . He says that at NIT , if one had a better ranking , they had the option of shifting to a branch of their choice . <p> And to Mukund 's luck , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to do electrical engineering . So , they swapped seats . <p> "" It was 2005 , and Google was big then . I wanted to be there . I was fascinated by how they could connect the world and the endless possibilities they could build , "" Mukund says . <p> While in college , Mukund went to IIT-Madras for an internship . He also started trying for different research internships , and sent close to 5,000 emails to different universities . <p> Mukund Jha with his batchmates at Columbia University <p> Building tech also started early on for Mukund . During his college days , he worked on speech technology and built a speech synthesiser from scratch in 2007 . He interned at UPV Universitat Politecnica De Valencia , Spain , in 2008 , where he worked on developing a speech recognition engine . <p> "" After college , I was wondering what next . My brother was taking the PhD route , and even I thought about it , but then when I joined for master 's course at Columbia University , I realised I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Mukund . <p> He , however , describes the first semester of his college in the US as one of the toughest . There was a lot of work , but I learnt so much more there - about working with different people and learnt to understand everything , he says . At Columbia , he went on to do his master 's in machine learning ( ML ) and also published a couple of papers on NLP and Social Data Mining . <h> The dream job at Google <p> While in the US , he worked at Columbia Business School where he developed a content management system . "" By this time , I kept working and focusing strongly on machine learning and the possibilities it would bring in . It was 2008 , the year of the financial crisis , and the only thing running in our mind as young graduates was how were we going to get jobs and internships , "" Mukund says . <p> Nevertheless , he managed to land a few research projects and internships at the university . <p> In 2010 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Google . At Google , Mukund was working directly with the Director of Engineering . <p> "" I worked on the ' Education for All ' product and we built that together . We would work nights building it . It was an edtech platform similar to Udacity , "" says Mukund . <p> While at Google , he also got several opportunities to work with the early leadership and the founding team . <p> "" It was my dream come true . Plus , the exposure I got was significantly high . After college , I got an offer at Google , but I wanted to work specifically for Search in New York , "" Mukund says . <p> Mukund joined the team and worked on Search Quality . Here , he worked in the search ranking team and did about 20 percent projects on assistant , news , and knowledge graph . <p> "" Once you join Google , the first thing that hits you is everyone is so intelligent . And everyone feels that - because you have the best and the smartest minds in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to work and prove that you are worth it , "" Mukund says . <h> Bitten by the startup bug <p> However , by 2012 , the startup ecosystem in the US was exploding . And bitten by the startup bug , Mukund decided to start something of his own . He later went on to launch his own startups . <p> While Mukund would keep building different products and things during his college days , they were n't marketable . <p> "" After Google , I really wanted to build something that would be different . So , along with a couple of batchmates , we started Wisdom.ly , a group video platform for virtual meetups and conferences , "" Mukund says . Started in 2013 , Wisdom.ly was one of the 20 companies that was chosen for the Startup Chile programme . <p> "" Startup Chile was a great networking opportunity and gave good exposure . You get to meet different startups , understand different products , and ideas . But we soon had to shut shop as there was no product-market fit . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why it is important to understand if your customer really needs a product . "" <p> For close to two weeks , Mukund and his batchmate , Alex Glocus , brainstormed on different ideas , and finally landed on building Habet in 2014 . Habet was an intelligent goal tracking platform that paid you to succeed . They offered challenges by using a combination of expert guidance , accountability , and cash rewards to help users accomplish more . <h> India calling <p> "" By 2015 , I came back to India as I was getting married , and my wife did n't want to move to the US . After returning to India , I started figuring out what to do next , "" Mukund says . <p> During this time , his father was running a chip designing electronics company and Mukund decided to add a Bengaluru office . But six months down the lane , he realised project management was not fun , and figured it was n't his cup of tea . <p> By then , he thought of recruitment as a space , and met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At that point in time , Ankur was building Fundoo Naukri , where freshers get jobs and projects based on a test . Though the idea was good , there were a few implementation challenges . <p> "" We teamed up and were thinking of ways to make it work . We soon morphed into a hacker rank kind of a platform . But again , while building the product was easy , the sales was difficult . So Ankur and I got into another brainstorming session , "" Mukund says . <p> It was then that they built an AI assistant for shopping around early 2015 . And at the same time , ' Magic ' happened in the US , which would get the user anything through a text message . <p> It felt like a great minimum viable product ( MVP ) to build , and they also decided to integrate it with WhatsApp and build it out . <h> Building Dunzo <p> "" We called it Wingman - text anything on WhatsApp and you get it done . A month and a half into building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was during this time that Blume Ventures connected us to Kabeer ( Biswas ) . We were both doing the same thing . We met for a month and felt there was a great synergy . So , in July 2015 , we co-founded Dunzo , "" Mukund says . <p> Initially , Dunzo was running on WhatsApp . "" The initial zero-to-one journey is always fun , "" Mukund adds . However , the biggest bottleneck was that a lot of people were using WhatsApp , and a lot of the operators were n't able to get them to shift . <p> So , they wrote a hack on WhatsApp where they would get the messages on the interface . It made the backend operations simpler , people could work on the interface , and it helped the team build strong operations , while the consumer side kept running on WhatsApp . <p> "" We built the partners ' side product and operations side . One of the mistakes was that initially we were really stuck on designs , and we wanted to get the best design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do everything from the first go . But there were multiple parallel processes , understanding a text and getting that into multiple tasks . So even before our consumer app launched , operationally we had figured out a lot of things on the backend , and it was a great learning , "" Mukund explains . <h> Quick turnaround <p> Today , for Mukund , coding is about things that are n't critical to timelines or anything that is n't directly connected to Dunzo . <p> "" I think of my strength as someone who can think of an idea and ensure that it can be put into someone 's hand really quickly . A lot of that helped when starting up as we would build so many things in parallel , "" Mukund says . <p> Dunzo was initially started as a purely chat-based product . But the team realised that supply was something they needed to focus on . They also needed to focus on partners , because all their tasks were purely based on logistics . <p> Speaking of the tech that goes into building Dunzo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our tech does is take the complex workflows in life and make them into systems behaving predictively . For running a single task , there are thousands of variables running on the computer - are you a new user , a user moving from a different city , task from a store that we have tied up with or not , does the store have a PoS machine , etc . We have started focusing on things that are high volume and can be run predictably well . We have written and rewritten systems multiple times to keep up with the pace of growth . "" <p> He says , language and technology keep transitioning , and it is best not to be stuck with one . <p> "" We ourselves are transitioning . We started out with Python as the main language , and today Go is becoming a prominent language . Hence , I look for someone who has an ability to learn things faster . The space we are in is dynamic , and priorities change . So , you need to have speed , "" he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Learning from mistakes <p> But then no journey is complete without mistakes . "" I have been told so many things and have read different things - mistakes not to be done , and you think you would n't make that mistake , but then you do end up making it , because in bits and pieces you do make mistakes , and it is fine , "" Mukund says . <p> What helped them was the urgency and eagerness they had to get things out in the hands of the user and learn from the user . Also , communication and product ownership are important for Mukund . He says , for a product like Dunzo , any change you make has an impact on multiple sides of the business . <p> "" People need to value the end consumer and user , because you are building for them . If you 're fundamentally strong on those concepts , your base is strong , you can build on top of that . We think iterations are really important . The faster you move , the faster you iterate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right niche and fit for your product , "" Mukund says . <p> He believes that a person in tech should really think of consumers and product as it adds a very high leverage on how you build things . Mukund believes , "" You need to be able to relate from an impact point of view and then build something technology gives you the power to create things . And with a B2C product , you can touch and feel the app , and you see it out in the real world , the infinite possibility it creates is high . It gives you a lot of creative power , you can think of lot of things and build it out . We are barely scratching the surface when it comes to what we can actually do . It is just going to keep integrating deeper in our lives . "" <p> Mukund 's advice to new engineers and techies is to "" try everything "" . He says , "" Join a startup , as the learning curve is super high , and start building.The moment you try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new things on the side . Spend time networking with the right kind of people , fresh engineers do n't network enough . "" <p> He says , "" Can you build something for a problem that is bothering you ? I have my own bot , which emails me a newsletter . """
"<h> Clark Gregg on Taking ' Agents of SHIELD ' to the 1980s and Saying Farewell to Phil Coulson <p> For Clark Gregg , Agent Phil Coulson has been the character who just wo n't die -- literally . The beloved SHIELD agent was killed off in Marvel Studios ' "" The Avengers , "" only to be resurrected a year later on "" Marvel 's Agents of SHIELD "" on ABC . Then Coulson died again at the end of Season 5 , only to return once more in Season 7 -- which premieres May 27 -- as a Life Model Decoy ( Marvel-speak for advanced robot ) . <p> Now "" Agents of SHIELD "" is entering its final season -- which was shot entirely in the summer of 2019 , making the series one of the rare broadcast scripted shows able to air a full season this summer . It also means that Gregg , once again , will have one ultimate , final , **27;2211;TOOLONG chance to say farewell to Coulson for good . Or will he ? <h> How did you feel about this season going to go all the way back to 1931 , well before SHIELD even existed ? <p> We 've gone into the future a lot in the show , but at the end of Season 6 we suddenly see the Empire State building under construction . I thought , "" OK , this is gon na mean some cool costumes and perhaps cool weapons "" -- and it 's turned out to be so much more . Really , I think they thought the show was kind of maybe done at the end of Season 5 . The finale episode was called "" The End "" and Coulson was going off to live out his few remaining days in Tahiti . And then when they found out there was going to be these two 13-episode seasons , I think they really are pulled out all the stops and decided to have just as much fun as possible . <h> Related Stories <h> In season 6 , you played Sarge , an antagonist who was n't Coulson but somehow had his body . Did you enjoy taking a break from that role to play somebody new ? <p> It was really thrilling . I never think of a person as the bad guy , but he definitely had an understanding of what was happening that left him a lot of room to not worry too much about the moral complexity of issues that Coulson obsesses over . So it got things really simple and clean and dark , and it was really fun . <h> Did you miss playing Coulson ? <p> Um . Did I miss ... ? Not really . Not during that particular three , four months . But it threw me a little bit at first because the reality of who Sarge was and why he looked that way was very complex and not really revealed to me -- or I think even figured out all the way -- until we were well along the way . I did n't have a lot to kind of hang my hat on and figure out how to ground myself . So it really took everything I had just to figure out how to make that storyline work with that tired old face . <h> What did you think of the decision to bring Coulson back as an LMD ? <p> I was a little thrown at first . I internalize everything Coulson cares about whether I want to or not . He was really adamant that he did n't want that . And even though I love the "" Star Trek : The Next Generation "" character Data , I did n't want Phil Coulson to be Data , you know , the cyber being following them around doing fast math . Their idea around it was very different . He 's wrestling with some of the stuff that classic AI characters have dealt with in the past : What am I ? What am I now , in his case . And he 's also not really the kind of typical LMD . There 's other , much more advanced stuff going on . I think someday when there is extremely advanced AI , it 'll be harder to really tell the difference between organic intelligence and that form of artificial intelligence . Pause I went full nerd on you , did n't I ? ! <h> Since Coulson died in "" The Avengers , "" the assumption that almost everyone seemed to make when ABC announced "" Agents of SHIELD "" was that he was going to be a Life Model Decoy . So actually doing it in the final season feels like a fun wink . <p> I thought so , too . You know , no one ever knew the show would go a 130-some episodes . It was never going to be like , this week Tony Stark is here ! Then there was the division between Marvel TV and Marvel Cinematic on a corporate level . So the showrunners , Jed and Mo and Jeff Bell , had to really scour parts of the Marvel universe that were n't tied up with the incredibly elaborate plans of the cinematic universe . They ended up using all kinds of things : inhumans , time travel , Ghost Rider , all these things that nobody is using , and many times to great effect . So it does n't surprise me that at some point , like , "" Well , it 's what everyone thought all along , and now he finally is one . "" <h> The first episode jumps back to 1931 . You wear a fedora quite well , but should we expect to stay in that era the run of the season ? <p> I think since we revealed there is the crossover with the wonderful "" Agent Carter "" show with the wonderful and classy Enver Gjokaj as Agent Sousa , I think we can say that , man , we get into some cool ' 50s stuff . I would n't be surprised if we did n't also end up in the ' 80s , and that might not even be all of the time periods . We might explore the comic book tropes of those times , some of the cinematic tropes of those times , you know what I mean ? You ca n't go to the ' 50s without feeling a little noir here and there . Everybody really pulled out all the stops and really made the most out of each of these time periods . There are some episodes that are tremendously fun , and others that are really scary and dark , and always with this mystery of these Chronicoms trying to undo parts of history . <h> You directed two episodes in the past -- did you direct an episode this season ? <p> I did n't do this season . There were a lot of people who really put in their time and were really ready to direct an episode . I 'm not gon na say who ; I 'm not allowed . But there were people who were angling for that . So I was really happy to see some of the people who had wanted that shot and really worked hard to get it and had shadowed on a lot of episodes were given shots . It will be very exciting when you see some of the people who directed some of these episodes . <h> You alluded to the divide between Marvel Television and Marvel Studios . By the last few seasons of "" Agents of SHIELD , "" the show stopped trying to figure out ways to tie into the movies . Like , no one on the show turned to ash after Thanos 's snap . Did you miss that connection at all ? Or was that more of like a relief that you did n't have to worry about it ? <p> I guess I did and I did n't . When you look back at Season 1 , and you look at the way it crossed over with Hydra and took the handcuffs off our poor writers when everyone was like "" What is this show ? "" -- and Sam Jackson and Cobie Smulders came to play -- I thought that was really thrilling . I missed that part of it , but I also felt like "" Agents of SHIELD "" really continued to evolve . And once they got to Season 4 , and there were three separate pods of episodes -- Ghost Rider , LMDs , and the Framework -- I thought this is what happens when these gutsy writers are n't tied too closely to all that . They get to really just tear it apart and start it over with a new corner of the Marvel Universe every season , sometimes two or three times in a season . <h> The Marvel TV era is ending with "" Agents of SHIELD "" just as Marvel Studios is producing new shows for Disney Plus on a huge scale . Not to put too fine a point on this , but do you look at those shows and wonder what might have been ? <p> Um . Laughs I do n't know specifically what kind of resources those shows are getting . I will say , as someone who loves storytelling and television , it 's been exciting to watch -- from "" Watchmen "" to "" Game of Thrones "" -- what 's being done cinematically on what used to be called TV . So in fairness , the world really changed around us . I was always proud of us for being the first ones through the door in terms of the Marvel stuff , trying to bring that to a weekly television format . I feel like ABC did a great job of trying to adapt to us as we tried to adapt to them . But I 'd be lying if I did n't say boy , that would really be interesting to start the experiment over , doing 10 episodes or 12 episodes the way Tom Hiddleston told me he was doing on "" Loki "" with that kind of budget and that Marvel Cinematic production team . Although , it 's hard for me to even think about that , just because I 'm so proud of what our crew and visual effects people and cast did within the constraints of our budgets and resources . <h> You 've had a lot of time , and in an unusual way , to contemplate what the series is meant for you between wrapping Season 7 last year and waiting for it to premiere . What have been some of your best memories from making the show ? <p> I thought Coulson was dead , and I thought I was done with that character , but the whole pitch from Joss Whedon was : Turns out , there 's a big secret there . You 're not dead , you 're on TV , and there 's a huge mystery Season 1 about why you 're not dead . And now you 're with a new team of some young and inexperienced people who will become a family to you . Because you will go through some bumpy times and some triumphs and your only ability to survive and transcend it will be in how you end up working together and committing to each other . To find myself as Coulson as no longer a kind of tertiary , in the shadows operative , but a leader -- all of that was a tremendous gift . And to be able to do it as a local production with crews at home , me getting to see my daughter after school each day , not shooting in another state , but in Culver City -- it was spectacular . I have deep , deep gratitude . It will a sad day when I watched the last episode of this on air . <h> You 've been playing Phil Coulson for 12 years since the first "" Iron Man , "" in movies and on television . It 's such a rare experience for an actor at any level to do that . What is this meant for you to play this guy for so long ? <p> I still sometimes have a hard time believing that this happened . You know , you stand around craft service when you have a small part for a week or two on "" Iron Man , "" and you think , "" Boy , what if they started adding scenes for this guy ? Would n't that be amazing ? They really should , if they were smart . "" But that never happens . To have that happen , and then be in other movies , and then , "" Oh you have a big arc in ' The Avengers . ' "" What ? ! And then to think that I had this amazing run that kept me here in Los Angeles and gave me a bunch of people I love . I feel incredibly fortunate . Also , to have connected with fans around the world . It 's not a character that usually connects with people . I think Coulson really landed for people and became this thing because they needed a normal person like them , vulnerable like them , in the middle of that world . It 's really moving to me . <p> Based on what 's going on in the world right now , to have been a character actor , you know , to have had a chance to make a living , keep my family fed with consistent work , sometimes long enough seasons that I could put away a little bit of money -- all that 's up for grabs right now . It 's gon na be a different time . I want to figure out how my friends who are actors , who have families to support , how they 're going to make a living , both just in pre-COVID world of 13 episodes here and there , and with COVID , how we 're going to make production work . It 's hard not to feel especially grateful given that this show happened before all that . <h> Do you think you 'll ever play Coulson again ? <p> This seems like a real good time to announce that ... I really do n't know . Laughs Sorry . That was a little bit of quarantine sadism . I do n't know anything ! It 's hard for me to imagine a scenario where I 'd say , "" No , I 'm too busy to put on whatever the latest version of the suit is and go play Phil Coulson . "" I 'm always thrilled when I see them changing timelines and exposing a multiverse in the cinematic universe . Because I think , "" Well , I 've seen scenarios where I could be around ! "" So I really learned with this character to never say never , but I 'm also really grateful for the ride that we had ."

"<h> Trending Now <h> Jack Ma Says Stop Looking to Manufacturing Growth for Jobs <p> ( Sept 21 ) : Alibaba Group Holding Ltd . Chairman Jack Ma , who wooed President Donald Trump earlier this year with a pledge to help create 1 million new U.S. jobs by 2021 , said people should stop looking to manufacturing to drive economic growth . <p> While the rapid speed of technological change is understandably causing concern about the future , Ma called on leaders to embrace the promise of advances like artificial intelligence to span whole new industries . <p> "" These worries are very normal -- two hundred years ago when the steam machine came , people started thinking the steam machine is going to take a lot of jobs , "" Ma said , speaking at the Bloomberg Global Business Forum in New York .

He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as inflammatory comments from Trump towards China , are just par for the course in a relationship between global powers . <p> "" The China-U.S. relationship is very critical in this century , and I think we are making progress on that , "" Ma said . - Bloomberg"

As technology changes the face of every industry , new opportunities open up all the time , while others disappear . <p> Some specialisms are in the ascendancy , with Next Big Things being identified regularly . Research by Dell even claims that 85% of the jobs that will exist in 2030 have n't even been invented yet . That means the ultimate question is , what 's next ? <p> At the end of 2018 , LinkedIn released its ' Emerging Jobs Report ' , drawing on their data to show the roles companies seem to be rapidly hiring for , and what trends can tell us about what 's to come . <p> Looking mainly at recruitment in the USA , they found the top emerging job to be Blockchain Developer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year . Machine learning popped up in second ( Engineer ) and fourth ( Specialist ) place ; while the third most rapidly growing role was Application Sales Executive . <p> But the story wo n't be the same everywhere . Jobseekers and those considering a career change must consider what skills they have that match the modern market . For more insight into what 's happening in the North of England , we approached a range of recruitment professionals from across the region to see what trends they 've identified . <p> "" Increasing demand for AI and machine learning skills across every industry "" <h> James McDonagh , Director of EMEA at Nigel Frank International <p> "" It 's almost impossible to predict what jobs will be in demand in the future - in the late 80s we were pitching roles like ocean hotel manager and lunar astronomer as the next big things - but given the direction that the job markets are going , and how the workplace is changing , we can take a good guess . <p> We 're seeing a big uptick in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cloud computing . These are n't brand new jobs , but now , as digital transformation becomes a prominent motivator for businesses , they 're starting to look into hiring people who can help them do more with tech . <p> Six of the 15 roles on LinkedIn 's Emerging Jobs list last year were tied to AI and machine learning , and we 're seeing increasing demand for these types of skills across every industry , so that 's going to be huge . <p> Over the next few years , data analytics and business intelligence are going to be massively in demand as organisations try and find the stories within that data , and derive insight that 'll help them get the edge over their competitors . I think of jobs like data scientist , BI analyst , and cybersecurity when I think of the roles we 'll be hiring for most in the near future . <p> Although tech jobs are experiencing all this growth , that 's not to say that tech skills are exclusively sought after by employers . <p> Things change so quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are relevant and in demand . Employers do n't want to be rehiring every time they need someone with a new set of skills , but rather are focusing more in in-house training and upskilling .

"" <p> "" Companies are focusing on the synergy between marketing and sales teams "" <p> "" The trends we are seeing is a continued growth within the fitness , nutrition , diet and lifestyle markets with significant new SMEs entering the market and continued growth from the larger brands . <p> There 's less of a focus around "" relationships with a brand "" but more about a personal , authentic relationship with the customer , led by product excellence and service . We have seen a sharp increase in roles driven by innovation in services , particularly in financial services - much more focus on product and proposition hires . <p> A lot of this has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. with changes in the banking sector such as Open Banking .

"<h> DBS GROUP HOLDINGS BUY ( UPGRADED ) <p> From a recent high ( $28.64 ) to a recent low ( $24.01 ) , the DBS share price has come off by some 16.2 per cent over a period of five weeks . <p> While the trade tension between the US and China was cited as one of the main reasons , the other reason was the recent decline in interest rates . <p> The three-month Singapore interbank offered rate was relatively flat from 2009-2014 at below 0.5 per cent , but started to move up from 2015 to the current level of about 2 per cent . <p> In the last 10 years , DBS ' net earnings have grown by a compounded annual growth rate ( CAGR ) of 10.6 per cent from $2.04 billion in FY2009 to $5.58 billion in FY2018 . <p> Dividend payout grew by a CAGR of 7.9 per cent during the same period from 56 cents to $1.20 currently . <p> With $1.20 dividend a share or 30 cents a quarter , DBS has some real estate investment trust-like traits . <p> Based on the Tuesday closing price of $24.80 , dividend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dated April 30 , we stated that we will turn buyers at $27.50 or lower .

"<p> Dubai 's well-earned moniker as a global trading hub is one of the stabilising pillars of the regional community . A robust economic environment not only helps create jobs and supports development but spreads technology and ideas , boosts productivity and enables cross-border communication channels and supply chains . <p> While entrepreneurship , the bedrock of a thriving society , is anybody 's game , the rates of female entrepreneurship have traditionally lagged a far second to those of men . The tremendous economic impact of increased female entrepreneurial participation is significant and continues to be a major driver of growth across economies . Women share an equal role with men in driving economic growth . Simply increasing women 's labour force participation and eliminating discriminatory barriers could raise productivity by as much as 25 per cent in some economies , reveal statistics in the World Bank Report Women , Business and the Law 2018 . <p> In light of these figures , it is easy to see the significant impact the continued increase of women-led businesses can have on domestic job creation and economic growth . A Harvard Business Review case study shows that on average , female-founded companies create over 60 per cent more value for investors than those founded by men . Therefore , investors continuing to seek opportunities to maximise returns on their capital would be wise to look towards female-led businesses . <p> Yet , the Middle East has one of the lowest rates of female entrepreneurship and female labour participation in the world . But things are looking up ; according to the World Economic Forum 's Global Gender Gap Report , released in November 2017 , the Mena region is showing noteworthy progress and is closing more than 60 per cent of its overall gender gap for the second year running . Last year also saw the first Women 's Economic Empowerment Global Summit take place in Sharjah where the focus was on sustainable development through gender equality . <p> Typically , the barriers that prevent women from running their own businesses range from a lack of access to funding to a lack of confidence in being able to balance work and home responsibilities , according to a US Senate report titled ' Tackling the Gender Gap ' . In essence , women are held back from being entrepreneurs due to time , resources and confidence . Additional barriers include a lack of access to education or training , and limited access to information and communication technology ( ICT ) , market information and finance . <p> Advertisement <p> We know that everyone benefits when women have the resources they need to fully participate in our economies and societies . While there are many challenges to women entrepreneurship , there has never been a more important time to make a concerted push for women to take charge . <p> UAE : A model exampleMany countries in the region are taking steps towards more gender equity . The UAE has been a model example of a country that is driving female participation across all areas of society . His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum , Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai , had publicly tweeted that women comprise 70 per cent of his work team . Around 70 per cent of university students are girls , the UAE 's female participation rate in the workforce stands at 46.6 per cent , and 66 per cent of all government employees are women , according to Sheikha Jawaher bint Mohammed Al Qasimi , chairperson of Nama Women Advancement Establishment . <p> Given the government 's impetus to transition away from its dependence on oil and look at innovative ways to both catalyse growth and create further jobs , it is key that the government focuses on supporting innovation and entrepreneurship , as well as developing a highly-skilled workforce - including supporting women to finding and growing their own businesses . <p> While smart and inclusive policies can go a long way in encouraging women entrepreneurs and workforce participation , the development of new technologies is equally crucial . New business technologies can help all entrepreneurs - regardless of gender - manage time and resources better . Automation and artificial intelligence can help enhance productivity and streamline business operations . It can also help remove the burden of repetitive and routine administrative tasks , so entrepreneurs can manage their businesses with greater ease and have more time to focus on growing their core business . <p> Meanwhile , advancements in cloud-based technologies and the Internet of Things can also allow for remote working , which is an important factor for women entrepreneurs who might have to balance both commitments at work and at home . Technology can level the playing field for female entrepreneurs , even if they have limited access to funding . <p> As technology continues to spread and create a level playing field and governments continue championing female entrepreneurship and participation in the workforce , society as a whole could be wealthier , happier and more productive . <p> The writer is regional technical director for Sage Middle East .

"<h> I think sometimes the best way to parse the temperament is to go over the most obviously ' wrong ' moves and address why they might not be wrong at all . <p> Let 's stop wondering and start figuring things out . Let 's stop marveling that the market keeps going higher and instead put pen to paper and write it all down and make sense of it because this rally is out of nowhere yet , remarkable and yet , I would argue , understandable and while some of it is based on leap of faith a lot of it is based on leap of taste , meaning good tasting stories that money managers are getting behind . <p> I think sometimes the best way to parse the temperament is to go over the most obviously "" wrong "" moves and address why they might not be wrong at all . <p> Take Amazon ( AMZN ) . When you pick up the front page of the Journal you read that the brother of the paramour of Jeff Bezos is thought to have sold out Bezos for $200,000 in lewd pictures . <p> When people read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on how can this guy be running this company and also contenting with this kind of craziness . There 's no way this stock should be going higher . "" <p> I , on the other hand , think that things are a little more rational than that . I think there is a flood of IPOs coming , Lyft , Uber , AirBNB and what do they have in common ? <p> The humongous engine that is Amazon Web Services , the 47% grower that is more profitable than any of the companies it powers . Now I know Bezos runs Amazon , but Andy Jassy runs AWS and it 's going to be a bigger driver going forward than Amazon retail , which , while not tapped out could be peaking for now . <p> As people realize the power of this machine underneath , the one that is ostensibly driving Amazon prime but is really becoming one of two cloud businesses of true scale along with Microsoft ( MSFT ) , they get why this stock can go up and become the real leader in this market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste . <p> How about Nvidia ( NVDA ) ? We just got back in it for Action Alerts PLUS . Why ? Do we hope that video games are coming back ? How about crypto-currencies ? Those are the two things that felled this stock . <p> Are people getting ahead of themselves ? <p> No , I do n't think so . Jen-Hsun Huang 's back . The Nvidia founder bought down Mellanox to double down on the data center . He 's got the best artificial intelligence chips . He 's going after all sorts of business we thought belonged to Intel ( INTC ) . And he 's going to have the right graphics for the next generation gaming that starts in 2020 . Clear path to higher prices . <p> Now there could be some hype or hope going on with the commodity semis . Micron ( MU ) reports tomorrow and firm after firm has come out and told you there could be a disappointment because Dram prices , the basic building block commodity , continue to plummet . But the buyers seem undeterred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see any demand generators there . It could be a problem tomorrow night for certain . And there 's the hype of the Apple ( AAPL ) video service when that 's unveiled March 25th . What if it is a letdown ? How much of this recent Apple run is because of the possibility of a bigger revenue stream service from video ? Or will it be free ? Will it be a dud ? Will they do anything with the information about how the watch saves lives , or is it too anecdotal to charge a monthly fee for ? Like Micron I wish I could find some real boots on the ground reasoning for the buying . But I ca n't . Call these vulnerable until we hear that China 's back on line without a trade war or with sales growth from lower phone prices . <p> The banks are levitating even though the yield curve does n't make them a lot of money and the economy 's slowing down . What 's that about ? Chimerical ? I do n't think so . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the possibility of a catastrophe at Deutsche Bank ( DB ) . Sometimes this group is only as strong as its weakest link and this group , especially JP Morgan ( JPM ) , Citigroup ( C ) , Bank of America ( BAC ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS ) trade with their weakest sister . There 's always vast conspiracies behind bank weakness because they are so opaque . However , if we get a merger between Commerzbank ( CRZBY ) and Deutsche Bank that gets rid of the pain point that 's good for all the banks . I also think that the group 's been getting no credit for all of the things the individual banks are doing to boost earnings away from core banking . How can you not like that Marcus , Goldman 's retail bank , is about to move the needle or the financial planning business that Morgan Stanley ( MS ) just bought , Solium Capital , is going to allow the firm to tap into many of the new millionaires this IPO market is about to create . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have we seen some upside from that line item for the banks . That 's another prop to the rally . <p> Healthcare , especially managed care , has been a dog of late but it has suddenly come alive . Is that a leap of faith ? I do n't think so , not when I read the lead story in the New York Times about how "" Democrats Split over Health Care at a Key Moment "" The article reads as if there is an insurgency supporting single payer which would be disastrous for an entire edifice of companies that suck off the healthcare teat . Alas , though , any read between the lines says you can stop worrying about that issue entirely because Speaker Nancy Pelosi favors incremental change . That means UnitedHealth ( UNH ) is about to go to all time highs and maybe CVS ( CVS ) , which bought Aetna at what looked like an inopportune time is n't so dumb after all . <p> Retail 's better . To me that 's a tough one . There 's enough bad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big move . I am calling that a leap of faith , perhaps based on the spring ? Maybe on a belief that with rates lower there will be more home equity loans and homes both new and used bought ? The usual suspects , Walmart ( WMT ) and Costco ( COST ) can be bought but I am betting on a nice Home Depot ( HD ) comeback . <p> Oil 's better but I am putting that squarely in the leap of faith category . I simply do n't believe it can break out and I would sell all but the majors because they have dividend protection : think Exxon ( XOM ) , Chevron ( CVX ) and BP ( BP ) . <p> Now before you think that I am being too rosy , once again I have to tell you that with enough that is weak from overseas coupled with that light employment number just two weeks ago , we do n't have to worry about the Fed for now . I know that 's always a dangerous posture . Nevertheless , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so the pressure is off . Therefore patience is a virtue . If patient is a virtue than we do n't have to worry about fighting the Fed . <p> And that 's the ultimate case for the leap of taste not faith , which means we have some breathing room to stay long provided that the potential hypesters , Micron and Apple , do n't both strike out . <h> Will You Have Enough Money to Retire ? <p> Want to learn about retirement planning from some of the nation 's top experts ?

"<h> The next generation <p> Day One ( 24 Jan ) of NAPSA Congress 2020 at the University of Newcastle .

"" <p> NAPSA President Erin Cooper told AJP that the biggest topic for students at the moment is being prepared for future roles . <p> "" In pharmacy it 's very topical at the moment with lots of organisations wanting to organise new services for pharmacy , introduction of prescribing etc , "" she said . <p> "" I think it 's just the unknown of what the future could be , and lobbying towards improving what we can do in the future -- and ensuring we can learn those skills now so that we have an easy transition into what the future may be .

"<p> The Irish man heading up an accelerator in Techstars ' Berlin chapter -- part of a worldwide network of startup programmes that fall under the banner -- was checking applications for the business boot camp and there was one outlier . <p> "" We got a team video , and they were singing Bohemian Rhapsody in a pub in Finland , and I almost hit delete right away , "" Murphy tells Fora . <p> "" But I ended up diving deeper and actually invested in the end . But I would n't encourage everyone to do what they did . "" <p> Among the thousands of applications he reviews each year , Murphy gets a lot of quirky pitches -- although that is n't necessarily the tactic he recommends for standing out . <p> Nevertheless , he said the Finnish startup got one thing right : nailing the all-important ' team ' element in a video application . <p> "" The stage we invest , from seed to series A , at that stage it is still very dependent on the team and the quality of the team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Startup Grind event last Tuesday . <p> There are several reasons we invest in a company ; it 's cheesy , but it 's true and really works -- team , team , team , market traction and idea . <p> "" We look at it like , this is a great team we want to work with . I often joke that you 're investing more in the jockey than the horse . The horse almost is n't even there , you are investing in the team . "" <p> Connor Murphy Source : Techstars <p> Murphy said the main mistake he sees startups make in their Techstars applications is to focus too much on every other part of the pitch except the people behind the business . <p> "" We have teams who have applied , and they do n't make it easy to work out how great they are . Tell us you 've got the ex-head of data science at Telefonica or the former chief information officer at HBO . <p> "" Some people can be too humble and they do n't say it . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call them the gold nuggets -- if you have something great , get it out there early on . "" <p> Life after Datahug <p> Murphy has been mentoring on Techstars programmes for several years , but he has stepped up his involvement since selling his company Datahug , which made software to mine employees ' communications data , in 2016 for ? 12 million . <p> He 's been managing director of Techstars ' SAP.iO Foundry in Berlin for the past year in a programme focused on machine learning software-as-a-service ( SaaS ) startups . <p> He said there were other options on the table after Datahug but , when he weighed them all up , a move to Berlin made the most sense . <p> "" I explored about five other things , to be honest . In fact , I was a bit slow to join Techstars at the start because I thought I want to be a founder again . <p> "" But as a mentor , I get to hang out with 10 companies every few months that really care about what they 're doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is a pretty great opportunity . "" <p> The Berlin operation of Techstars is one of 38 programmes that fall under the umbrella worldwide from an organisation that started as a single accelerator in the US over a decade ago . <p> Its expansion has been a very Irish-tinged affair , with Belfast-born John Bradford leading the first foray in Europe , while the New York operation was previously headed by Eamon Carey , who now oversees the London programme . <p> Source : Flickr <p> Despite the strong connection to Ireland , the organisation is yet to set up a physical presence in the country -- an idea that Carey was cold on when interviewed by Fora last year . However , Murphy sounds more optimistic about the prospect . <p> "" There is a common Irish pattern , just look at who is running Techstars , "" he said . <p> "" The accelerator is n't there yet but Dublin is definitely a city Techstars wants to go to . <p> Our expansion plans are usually with corporate partners . For example , Statoil is bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accelerator . <p> Murphy adds that he believes travel technology would be a good focus for any locally based accelerator . <p> "" I think travel would work really well in Ireland , if you think of all the travel companies like CarTrawler , Hostelworld , Ryanair , all the aircraft leasing companies . <p> "" Food tech is another one , but finding that right corporate partner is the thing . Techstars ' goal is definitely to be in Dublin and more than likely a Techstars powered by some corporate partner . "" <p> Good idea <p> While Murphy is n't plotting an immediate return to heading his own startup , he seems fairly set on what he would want to do . <p> "" I think I only have one good idea , and I could have executed better on it . We had a great team ( at Datahug ) and did a great job , but it was such a learning curve . <p> "" I always joke that at Datahug there were loads of things we did wrong , and I think if I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Datahug Two or Hugdata , "" he said . <p> "" I would n't rule that out , it 's something I really believe in and I think it might show how simple-minded I am . "" <p> Murphy said his main lessons from setting up Datahug were that even the trio of a great idea , great team and execution were n't always enough . <p> He adds that there are numerous , small variables that need to go right in a company -- and that having the right adviser involved in the early stages can make or break a young business . <p> "" There are so many reasons you are going to mess up and make little mistakes that will compound , "" he said . <p> "" It 's why mentors are so important . I had a mentor who helped me all the way through Datahug . I have three daughters now , but if I had a son his middle name would have been after the mentor 's name . <p> "" A really great mentor can change the trajectory of your career and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concise and do n't ramble on . I have to look at hundreds , if not thousands , of applications a year . Just get your idea and numbers in there if you have any , and get a good team video .

The same education system that has to prepare the future of this country , the youth , for the future of work , continues to exist in the same way it has for years ... not acknowledging this rapidly transforming world . <p> Having said this , one may also argue that before we begin to incorporate the future of work , we need to ensure the education systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is taught in school and what is applied by and expected of the workforce when they commence their careers . <p> Hence , there is an urgent need to incorporate necessary changes in the education system so that they ensure three things : <p> 1 ) The youth is aware of the career options available to them , and the path to take to achieve them , including the jobs of the future . <p> 2 ) The youth is able to make an informed decision about the career options most suited to them , aligning with their skills and interests . <p> 3 ) Educational institutions are equipped with the means to prepare the youth for their preferred career choices . <p> While the current education system provides a solid foundation to students , it needs to integrate and incorporate these aforementioned salient points to equip and enlighten the youth further , so that they can make better decisions and in turn help build the economy of the country . <p> The World Economic Forum 's Future of Jobs 2018 report states that while automation will lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many emerging professions will increase their share of employment from 16% to 27% by 2022 . Hence , while there are challenges in terms of work being automated and jobs being lost , there are also opportunities in terms of jobs that are being added or being transformed from their current traditional ways . Lifelong learning is one such way to ensure that these opportunities are utilized . Continuous learning will also ensure that any threat to changes in the way of work are countered . A 2016 report on the ' Future of Jobs in India by BCG and CII ' elaborates upon this . <p> At present , there is a lack of knowledge of professions beyond a few popular ones . Almost 67% of the students we spoke to in 2018 , through our programs at Arthan Foundation , had knowledge about only a few limited career domains -- medicine , law , teaching , engineering and some vocational careers like salon services , stitching , and electrical or plumbing services . Further , even within these there was paucity of understanding of what must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualifications needed , or steps to approach them and so on . More critically , there was no emphasis on exploring career options that matched the passion and interests of the students . Students were mostly unaware about the jobs of the future -- AI , Data Analytics , Robotics , Machine Learning and so on . <p> The future world of work for which the present must prepare has many unanswered questions . And while we would have to approach each question carefully , what is needed now is to ensure that skills ( cognitive , technical or social-emotional ) that are taught in school are aligned with what will be required in the job market of the future . Career counselling -- that enables exposure to the vast array of career paths along with the manner to approach these careers -- ought to be made available to students , where technology can play a crucial role to bridge the gap and provide accessibility to students in the most remote parts of the country . <p> Arthan Foundation is a Delhi-based non-profit organisation that prepares students for the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program . Arthan Foundation believes that empowering children with the right knowledge , information and 21st century skills to enable them to make informed career choices is critical to alleviating poverty in India . <p> "" Education is the passport to a good future . Something that stays with the child forever . To uplift our country , a good quality education would teach from history not to make the same mistakes . It teaches us tolerance , respecting each other 's differences and remaining united . The boys learn to respect girls and when the girls grow up to be mothers , they pass on that knowledge to their families , their children . Education alleviates the mind to higher thoughts and clarity . It is the most essential and most powerful weapon of a country .

"<h> Emerging economies should embrace , not shun , digital transformation <p> May 15 , 2019 <p> Mark Davison is at Lenovo Accelerate in Orlando -- New technologies such as artificial intelligence ( AI ) , augmented and virtual reality ( AR/VR ) and the Internet of Things ( IoT ) are often viewed with suspicion by people in emerging economies who believe that they will replace jobs and further impact already high unemployment levels . <p> But the hard fact of the matter is that while the current global trend towards digital transformation might make some more mundane tasks obsolete , the various technologies that are emerging offer massive benefits . And they will , as they mature , create many new forms of more skilled and efficient employment , as well as new job categories that have not yet been invented . Not to mention the benefits to society as a whole . <p> Jon Pershke , vice-president : strategy and emerging business development at Lenovo , says that while he can understand the predicament faced by emerging countries , they should embrace the transformation that is underway rather than shun it . <p> "" I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pervasive , "" Pershke says . "" Lenovo as a company has had to transform , our customers have transformed and our channel partners need to transform too . <p> "" Ultimately , whenever technology evolves , people adapt , "" he continues . "" And when new technologies emerge there is always job creation -- usually more value-add jobs such as programmers and developers . There will be adjustments , for sure , but think of the overall benefits of these new technologies such as AR . Kids being educated in school using AR ... experiencing things they never dreamed of ... city kids walking with elephants , for example . Surgeons utilising AR for remote diagnosis and treatment ... even simpler applications like overlaying veins so a nurse knows exactly where to inject . <p> "" There are an immense number of use cases that can be of benefit to society , "" he says . <p> Pershke has been at the forefront of Lenovo 's innovation in AR which yesterday saw the launch of the AR6 , a much lighter headset than traditional models which fits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now remotely attached to the user 's belt or a lanyard around their neck . It is arguably one of the first steps that will boost widespread adoption of the technology . Removing the weight of the battery from the actual headset to make it less cumbersome and more appealing to wear ? Who would have thought ? <p> So how does he see the future of AR developing ? <p> "" If I could predict that , I could retire , "" he smiles . "" But I 'm very bullish about the future of AR . One of the reasons that I spearheaded the technology at Lenovo was that it became very apparent to me the impact it could have . We 've been working on AR for some time and we 're now starting to see the power of putting visual information into the digital world , and the many potential use cases . <p> "" When we were developing the technology , instead of looking at industries that it could affect , we started off by saying : What industries wo n't be affected ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we firmly believe that this technology is going to be pervasive . <p> "" Just look at the example of Airbus we highlighted in the keynotes , "" he says . "" Airbus is literally saving millions of dollars using AR to speed up its maintenance programmes . Every minute that an aircraft sits on the tarmac costs money and this time period is vastly reduced by using AR . "" <p> Pershke predicts that it wo n't be long before AR becomes a mainstream technology available and affordable to all -- not just big corporates . <p> "" As the technology matures , the prices will come down , it will get a lot thinner and a lot better , "" he says . "" It 's going to start getting pretty pervasive and make people more productive . It 's going to change peoples ' lives . "" <p> Pershke is convinced that AR could become the "" next big thing "" in technology . <p> "" Think about it , "" he says . "" Over the past 20 years or so , what are the innovations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer is : Touch and some voice . I think AR is in the same category and is going to be the next big innovation . "" <p> He gives an example : "" Think of how millennials learn about things . They go to YouTube to see someone doing what it is they want to do and learn that way rather than by reading or having someone tell them how to do something . "" <p> And that is what AR is all about , he adds : visual interaction . <p> And as for the fear-mongers in emerging economies who see it as creating additional unemployment ? We threw the example of miners at him . <p> "" Mining involves some very complex equipment , "" Pershke replies . "" So how do the operators of the future learn about it ? They are not going to sit down with manuals , they are going to get an AR headset and learn from that . It will change the type of jobs that are done . Guys that do maintenance on mining equipment ... it will change how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw the parallel with Airbus , "" he says . "" Society will continue to find ways to use AR that empower employees , that help them compete better . Every industry is competitive and businesses are looking for that edge . AR is simply a new set of tools that will enable them . <p> "" The idea of vision powered by AI -- so many use cases , "" he adds . "" Obtaining information through in-store cameras -- and using this constructively . A lot of brick and mortar retailers tell us it allows their workers to be more engaged with their customers which , in turn , helps them compete with their online competitors . It comes down to the kind of customer service that online retailers ca n't provide . "" <p> Pershke reiterates that emerging markets should be embracing transformation and look to advance with it . <p> "" Look at the many advances that have evolved through history , "" he says . "" Transportation , for example . You did n't get to this conference in a horse and carriage ; you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will continue to advance in a similar fashion , "" he smiles again . "" I 'm not too sure many of us would move back . """

"<h> Exclusive : How companies can stay secure in the cloud <p> Recently Security Brief had the opportunity to talk to Bitglass APJ VP of sales David Shepherd about cloud security . <h> What are the threats companies moving to the cloud or adoption cloud services are least prepared for ? <p> I think most people now accept that moving to the cloud is no less secure than the traditional way of doing things ; in fact , in many cases , the cloud offers more security than most enterprises could hope to achieve in-house . This being said , some threats in the cloud are different to those historically faced in on-premises-only environments . <p> For example , organisations moving to the cloud must defend against malware that can quickly infect a business by spreading through personal and corporate devices as well as the cloud apps that they access . Additionally , enterprises must understand the shared responsibility model of security and adopt new tools for addressing unauthorised external sharing , advanced cloud phishing attacks , and more . <h> How have CASBs had to evolve as threats to companies in the APJ region change ? <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those around the world . Regardless , CASBs have had to adapt to address these threats and help customers understand and manage cloud data risk . Initially , most CASB offerings were designed solely to provide visibility into SaaS app usage in the enterprise . <p> However , they have rapidly evolved into flexible tools that can be used for a massive variety of use cases ; for example , securing the mobile workforce , new apps , BYOD , and IaaS platforms , as well as responding to misconfigurations in cloud platforms , inappropriate sharing , data leakage , malicious insiders , and zero-day malware . <h> What are the biggest barriers preventing companies from implementing a CASB to secure the cloud ? <p> Solving today 's problems requires fresh thinking . Perhaps the biggest barrier we need to challenge is the belief that traditional tools like firewalls are able to offer comprehensive data security in a cloud-first world . <p> This belief may be due to an overestimation of how well on-premises security tools can extend to the cloud , a fixation on the sunk costs associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around cloud threats . Whether you believe you 're using the cloud or not , your users have probably already moved your data into this new landscape . <h> What are the biggest opportunities using a CASB brings a company as opposed to implementing their own cloud security protocols ? <p> We 're seeing a continued shift toward the consumerisation of IT . People no longer want to build and maintain their own networks , infrastructure , or applications -- it 's inefficient and not the best use of their budget or IT resources . As such , many companies prefer to consume IT-as-a-service and commit more focus to running their businesses . <p> By leveraging a third-party CASB , organisations are able to benefit from a specialised solution that secures data right out of the box with prebuilt policies and proven efficacy . Additionally , cloud access security brokers serve as a single pane of glass for ensuring consistent security across all of an enterprises ' cloud applications , eliminating the need to manage dozens ( or hundreds ) of applications ' disjointed , native security features . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective CASB solutions are commonly known as multimode or hybrid CASBs . These integrate with application programming interfaces ( APIs ) to secure data at rest , and proxy traffic in order to protect data in transit between apps and devices . Uniquely , the Bitglass Next-Gen CASB uses an agentless reverse proxy architecture . <p> This means that we are up and running and fully deployed in hours rather than months . Companies start to receive value immediately , which is almost unheard of when deploying enterprise security tools . To cope with the dynamic cloud landscape , we are leveraging machine learning to automate protections and ensure that we deliver proactive , real-time security for any app , any device , anywhere ."
"<h> How to spot a ' design-led ' versus ' design-fed ' company <p> Companies with a ' design seat ' at the highest levels of decision making , and tout a ubiquitous ' design thinking mindset ' throughout the company are the ones best resonating with customers , according to Forrester principal analyst , Ryan Hart . <p> "" Either the CEO is a designer himself , or he has embraced design as the way of working moving forward , "" said Hart , explaining companies that have design at the core of all major business-making decisions , and designers strategically placed throughout the organisation , are finding success . <p> "" Design thinking is the secret sauce of these companies . It is not just design thinking with a select group of resources in the company , but a scaled design thinking mindset . "" <p> Speaking to a crowd of 350 business executives at the Forrester CX Forum in Sydney , Hart revealed the difference between a traditional , often limited ' design-fed ' company versus a collaborative , more customer-centric ' design-led ' company . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't design-led is design-fed . Essentially , you have a design department in your company that is feeding into lines of business throughout your company . You do n't have to look any further than Japan to find design-fed companies , "" he said . <p> "" Sharp , for example , is a company that embodies this zombie company , which a big problem that they are facing now in Japan . For so long , they Sharp led with technology . They did n't lead with the customer . The customer was going one direction and they took technology in another direction . So you have Panasonic , you have Toshiba , you have Sharp , that are all on life support now , barely making ends meat and very close to going bankrupt . "" <p> Hart noted design-fed companies are not design-led and they are actually "" very immature "" when it comes to creating customer obsession . <p> "" Sure , they are customer aware . They realise they have customers . They may have a lot of data as well . They may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and services they put out are perfect , which means they are working with a ' waterfall ' methodology in terms of developing products and services , "" he said . <p> But those companies , who plan resources and the milestones and chart a lengthy course for product development , are slow to address customer needs . <p> "" During that time to create the perfect product , the customer has sinced moved past you . Those expectations are rising too quickly and unfortunately companies are now struggling to keep up with that , "" Hart continued . "" And frankly , companies that are doing this are highly siloed and they are not connected . "" <p> On the flip side , successful design-led companies make sure they collaborate , make together , break together , and reassemble . <p> "" Not only do design-led companies realise they have customers , but they are led by where the customers are taking them . They are closely aligning their products and services with what the customer actually want and need , "" Hart said . "" They have data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insights and using that data to drive new innovations and products and services . "" <p> Additionally , Hart said the successful design-led companies have given up trying to be fast , but at the same time are pumping out MVPs ( most viable products ) to market in order to be quick-to-market and have it user tested . "" They can test and they can iterate and move forward from that . "" <p> These companies have also broken down siloes , he suggested . "" They move and they work in a highly connected fashion . "" <p> Hart outlined a number of operating principles for a customer-obsessed company , mainly being customer-led , insights driven , fast and connected . <p> "" Design-led companies take it a step further : They use the word design , the language of design within the organisation , to actually coalesce all of the employees and everyone around the idea that we are designing incredibly beautiful products that customers love , "" he said . "" And design is a language we use to express that , and everyone rallies around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a design-focused space . "" Whether you call it an innovation hub , a future lab , or you call it a design centre , you need to have some collaborative space where people can work together in an open environment . <p> "" An environment that is safe to creatively take risks and to share ideas - and somewhere where you can bring customers in , or bring other stakeholders from other parts of the business to work together in a shared space . "" <p> Highlighting steps to scale the design-thinking mindset , Hart urged companies to seek external education to ramp the key employees ; transfer the skills with outcome-specific workshops ( "" create the light-house "" ) ; cycle project teams through to broaden benefits through the shared space ; cement the mindset with design leadership ; and do n't forget the loose ends and do n't stop ( people that do n't normally interact with customers including HR , procurement and legal ) . <p> "" It is like learning another language . You have to internalise a new way of thinking , but once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can begin spreading it and democratising that skillset across your organisation , "" Hart said . <h> Customer-centric moves at Australia Post <p> Australia Post chief customer officer , Christine Corbett , said her organisation is well placed to embrace design thinking and get the executive team on-board.Corbett 's role was created in July last year . <p> "" We 're making sure it is led from the top and it actually has that c-suite support , which is crucial . Because then people know you are serious , "" she said . <p> In sharing Australia Post 's ' secret sauce ' on customer strategy to attendees , Corbett said employees - which comprises of 54,000 staff - need to be part of the customer-centric journey . <p> "" There are a lot of fads that come and go , so people need to know that you are serious about customer obsession . They need to know we are serious about working a different way , and that means it needs to be led from the top , "" she told attendees . "" It needs to be felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every day . <p> "" If you 're going to be customer-centric , customer obsessed , you have to get people to believe what you say . It has to start with putting the tools in their hands and listening to what they are experiencing . What are going to be your customer pain points , invariably are the pain points that your people experience every day . "" <p> Corbett said Australia Post has rolled out a number of tools and programs to deliver enhanced customer experiences and address design led thinking . <p> In creating a customer-centric approach , one of the initiatives involved trialling a parcel delivery experience , which extended delivery until 8:00pm up until Christmas . <p> It also boosted resources in the complaints part of the business , introduced ' how long ' a customer would be on hold in peak hours , introduced call back functionality , live chat and 24/7 service for small business customers . It also offers the Safe Drop app , which lets consumers choose to have eligible parcels left in a safe place . <p> "" Customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access , they want convenience and they want control , "" she said . <p> In order to compete in this new battlefield , Corbett said the organisation focused on four key pillars : Creating seamless experiences ; listening to customers and taking action ; knowing its customers ; and empowering its people . <p> "" It is not enough to just design and think . My personal problem with the word design thinking is that that word turns off a lot of the more traditional executives because a lot of them want to be able to focus on outcomes . So design thinking has to be linked with outcomes , "" she said . <p> Additionally , Corbett said it 's crucial to know your customers . Digital disruption over the last 10 years has revealed a new Australia Post customer , she said , explaining the operation has over 10,000 customer interactions a day . <p> "" We always used to rely on the person who paid us the money , which was the sender . They are the people we had a contract with , whereas now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end consumer , who is really driving change . They are demanding more and causing us to adapt our business model and indeed how we go about the way that we work . "" <p> To address demands , Corbett said the organisation rolled out a range of delivery choices , including MyPost , which enables users to receive parcels where and when they want them . Last July , it also rolled out an accelerated workflow app that allows employees to log and track a customer issue , and have it resolved within 24 hours . <p> In June , Australia Post will launch its community cloud platform , which is a campaign that will go out to every Australian , seeking answers to ' ' what matters to you ? ' <p> "" We are n't going to create new initiatives for next year - you 're going to tell us what matters to you , "" Corbett said . "" And this is going to be an online portal where we will be able to look down to a neighbourhood level , what are the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that information through to the local workforce ?

"<h> The Entrepreneurial Evolution of Canadian Culture <p> Yesterday the Canadian Club of Toronto held a lunch and panel discussion called "" Raising a Billion Dollar Baby "" in downtown Toronto . <p> The purpose of the panel discussion was ostensibly how to build a company with routes in Canada , but the conversation turned more to the strengths and weaknesses of Canadian culture , and how it is evolving to become more entrepreneurial . <p> The panelists , Alan Lau , the co-founder and CEO of Wattpad , Steve Woods , founder of Equola and a few other companies , and Tony Lacavera , the founder of Wind Mobile , were moderated by Amber Mac , a tech journalist . <p> Much of the discussion focussed on Toronto , and specifically the long strides the city has made in building a startup ecosystem over the past 15 years . All the panelists agreed that Toronto was once a desert in terms of resources and an established tech landscape , but has since begun to flourish because of a unique set of strengths . These strengths included general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other tech hubs . But Lau noted the true strength of the Toronto ecosystem is the diversity of the city . <p> "" 51% of people in Toronto were not born in Toronto , so if you want to build a global business , I ca n't think of a better place , "" said Lau . <p> Lacavera echoed Lau 's sentiment . While travelling all over the world for Wind Mobile , Lacavera said that the incubators and accelerators are among the best anywhere . <p> "" The startup ecosystem in Toronto is on par with anything I 've seen in the world , "" said Lacavera . <p> Lacavera also noted the desire many Canadian startups have to move to Silicon Valley as quickly as possible may be misguided . <p> "" Go out there to get funding , but do n't set up headquarters there . Take advantage of the capital , but think about setting up your headquarters in Canada , "" he said . <p> Beyond Toronto , the panelists were quick to point that Canada as an entire nation has made great strides in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trend , the panelists noted , is continuing in that direction , especially in certain areas , like quantum computing companies based in Vancouver . <p> "" I 'm hugely excited about the quantum computer .

Alan Lau went as far to tell his employees , "" guys and girls , we need to be more assertive . Do n't be so Canadian , "" he said . <p> For Steve Woods , the cultural niceness of Canadians is something that can be a setback in such a competitive space , but ultimately can be overcome . <p> "" There is a difference between us and our neighbors to the south , and that difference can manifest in Canadians not swinging for the fences , "" said Woods . <p> Canadian culture in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to Lacavera .

"" <p> While the bulk of the panel anchored in a Canadian context , the panelists also shared their ideas and experience that could help entrepreneurs more generally . For Steve Woods , the most important thing for startups today is using cutting edge technology . This goes beyond just tech companies , but any company should take advantage machine learning , or anything to give themselves an edge . <p> "" If you 're creating a product in 2016 and not using cutting edge tech , you need to ask yourself why this was n't a business ten years ago , "" said Woods . <p> For Alan Lau , the future of all industry hinges on the internet .

"<h> Ransomware will get bolder and AI will pose more security threats in 2018 <h> Ransomware will get bolder and AI will pose more security threats in 2018 <p> As data becomes the new oil driving the world economy , hackers will go after it more than ever before , spurring demand for professionals to skillfully thwart their efforts aimed at licking away all the digital grease . <p> Cybersecurity analyst John Mason sees 3.5 million new , unfilled cybersecurity jobs being created by 2021 as compared to the one million openings seen in 2016 -- a whopping increase of 350% over five years . Last year , Mason saw $86.4 billion being poured in cybersecurity . What will be the top cybersecurity trends for 2018 ? Here 's a look : <p> 1 ) Evolution of ransomware <p> The year 2018 , Mason believes , will see the evolution of ransomware . According to him , the number of malicious apps increased from 500,000 in 2013 to 2.5 million in 2015 to 3.5 million in 2017 . Mason claims that 77% of these malicious applications are malware . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously , with 20% having no recovery plans in place . This means if and when they come under attack , they will have no road map to get their data back . The analyst also said that 42% of the businesses "" that do have a disaster-recovery strategy use a tape-based , outdated backup method "" . <p> According to a report by US security software firm McAfee , 2018 will see ransomware technologies aiming to extort money from individuals and organisations as a condition to release their digital hostages . <p> The report goes on to say this drive among adversaries for greater damage , disruption , and the threat of greater financial impact will not only spawn new variations of cybercrime business models , but also begin to effectively drive up the cyber insurance market . <p> "" While much about the motives behind WannaCry and NotPetya are still debated , the use of pseudo-ransomware is likely to continue , partly due to the ease with which as-a-service providers can make such techniques available to anybody with the means to pay , "" said Raj Samani , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> "" Such attacks could be sold to parties seeking to paralyse national , political and business rivals , which raises perhaps the biggest , unavoidable ransomware question of 2017 : Were WannaCry and NotPetya actually ransomware campaigns that failed in their objectives to make significant revenue ? Or perhaps incredibly successful wiper campaigns ? "" Samani said . <p> 2 ) Artificial intelligence will spawn more adversaries <p> As the world starts to embrace artificial intelligence , AI will also find its use in detecting vulnerabilities and suspicious behaviour . In terms of constant vigilance , Mason said , robots or programmes might prove more effective than humans in fighting off cyber-threats . <p> According to him , nearly $2.5 billion would be spent on AI technologies trying to ward off cyber-attackers between 2016 and 2025 . However , that does n't stop the bad guys from employing the technology themselves via machine learning techniques to scope out weaknesses and carry out more efficient attacks after learning more about the defence systems themselves . <p> According to a McAfee report , malicious hackers might employ AI to discover vulnerabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms race , organisations must effectively boost machine judgment and the speed of orchestrated responses with human strategic intellect . Only then will organisations be able to understand and anticipate the patterns of how attacks might play out , even if they have never been seen before , "" it said . <p> 3 ) Internet of Things to make network more vulnerable <p> Internet of Things or IoT will bring in added vulnerabilities for an organisation . Although IoT or connected devices make our lives easier ( either by telling us that our refrigerator has run out of milk or by voice computing through assistants such as Siri , Alexa and Cortana ) , they also make the network more vulnerable . <p> "" The problem is that all of that interconnectedness makes consumers highly susceptible to cyberattacks . In fact , one study revealed that 70% of IoT devices have serious security vulnerabilities , "" Mason wrote in a blog post , highlighting issues such as "" insecure Web interfaces and data transfers , insufficient authentication methods , and a lack of consumer security knowledge "" that open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of server-less apps results in considerable time-saving and cost-saving , it also opens up vulnerabilities . <p> "" Server-less apps enable greater granularity , such as faster billing for services . But they are vulnerable to attacks exploiting privilege escalation and application dependencies . They are also vulnerable to attacks on data in transit across a network , and potentially to brute-force denial-of-service attacks , in which the server-less architecture fails to scale and incurs expensive service disruptions , "" a McAfee report explained . <p> 5 ) Shift from protection and prevention to detection and response <p> "" Take the money you 're spending on prevention and begin to drive it more equitably towards detection and response , "" said Earl Perkins , research vice-president , research firm Gartner . "" The truth is that you wo n't be able to stop every threat and you need to get over it . You ca n't protect everything equally ... We have to find a way to control only what matters . "" <p> According to Perkins , organisations should look at remedial action instead of thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perkins , we might see security experts move to a predictive model with the use of AI or cognitive engines ."
"<h> The Promise of a Better Energy Future is Here -- Now We Must Secure It <p> Before the smartphone , telephones and the telecom business were all about landlines and wires . Despite decades of investment in wire-based business plans , digital technology changed everything within a few years . The core value proposition of telephone companies went from connecting landline to landline calls securely and cost effectively , to delivering secure data on demand to a flood of consumer devices . <p> A similar revolution is happening in the energy industry . It is affecting everything from charging your car at home to managing intermittent energy sources like wind power to municipal smart meters and commercial energy batteries in office buildings . Each of these innovations call for more sophisticated digital controls . That means that if we want the kind of future sci-fi fans can geek out about , utility companies need to reinvent -- and secure -- the entire energy ecosystem . <p> "" There are two mega trends that are driving the transformation in the energy industry . The first is digitalization , and the second are the changes in power production and distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads industrial cybersecurity Siemens Energy , Inc. -- a company that has devoted considerable effort to protecting the infrastructure needed to deliver the coming changes . <p> How megatrends are driving a seismic digital shift in the energy industry <p> Utilities are using digital tools to shift decades-old business models towards optimization along the entire energy value chain . They are bringing more renewables online , digitally connecting old and new energy assets , and enabling remote operations so that the electric grid functions with internet-like speed , communication and interconnectivity -- and less like electrons moving down a one-way street from power plant to consumer . <p> When we spoke with Simonovich , he was n't sugar-coating the magnitude of this shift : some things are going to have to change , and utilities will have to focus on cybersecurity like never before , or risk losing their competitive advantage and customers . <p> "" The utility of the future is going to be defined by its cybersecurity posture , and much less so by the challenges that it faced in the past , "" he explained . "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digital companies to survive . "" <p> The challenge utilities face is existential in many ways . The grid , and the utility industry responsible for its security , was designed for the old ecosystem where power plants just pushed electrons to its customers . Households , municipalities , and businesses that used to passively consume electricity now interact with grid-edge technologies in more complex relationship . In this model , customers become engaged producers -- or prosumers -- and a utility 's role is less about providing power and more about safeguarding the networked ecosystem that moves power from where it 's available to where it 's needed . <p> Why cybersecurity will become the foundation for utilities <p> While each new technology brings tremendous opportunities for positive change -- economic , environmental , and otherwise - each also opens a new potential weakness in the grid 's security . It 's a fact of physics that changes in the grid move as fast as lightning . If operators do n't intervene correctly , a single failure can cascade across the grid . With nearly all energy assets interconnected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry 's vast infrastructure is an attack on the whole , and that attack surface is growing -- rapidly . And this is taking place in a world of flourishing cyber-crime and nation-state-backed bad actors who intentionally target critical infrastructure . <p> Advertisement <p> That 's why cybersecurity can no longer be viewed as just a cost of ensuring the flow of electrons from the power plant to consumers . Now it is the foundation that upholds the entire energy ecosystem , and utilities will have to make cybersecurity a core of their business model in order to protect everything touching the grid . <p> "" Utilities will compete on security , "" Simonovich said . "" They will need to demonstrate that they 've reduced risk and kept consumers safe . It will need to be measurable , and it will need to be traceable . In other words , cybersecurity now must be viewed as part of any offering that utilities will provide to their customers , "" he continued . "" It needs to be reflected in the pricing methods . "" <p> How new solutions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how does a utility begin to place cybersecurity at the core of its business while implementing new defenses to protect ever-increasing attack surfaces ? <p> "" At its most basic level , utilities are incapable of defending what they ca n't see , "" said Simonovich . Cybersecurity strategies begins with context and visibility into their operating environment , and can now use an expanding set of tools to monitor that information and get ahead of attackers . <p> By analogy , visibility is pointing a camera at your front gate , and context is the information you need to understand who 's coming through , when , and why . Both are needed . Visibility ensures cybersecurity teams can see what 's happening across every digitally connected node in the ecosystem . Context provides security professionals with an understanding of a grid 's normal operating environment , so they can better detect anomalies . <p> But making sense of all this raw intelligence gathered from across the grid remains a core challenge . To truly secure the grid , cyber experts need to analyze and de-code vast amounts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to be looked together . Security professionals need context and visibility into both a company 's information technology ( IT ) systems and from its physical equipment ( collectively known as OT or operating technologies ) . <p> Simonovich 's group at Siemens Energy came up with a methodology called Process Security Analytics that helps unify IT and OT data into a unified threat stream by creating a common language between digital and physical assets . Because the grid can be manipulated by both IT and OT commands , "" a key stroke on a computer is as powerful as pulling a lever or altering a valve on a physical machine -- and vice versa , "" explained Simonovich . <p> "" This synergy between IT and OT means that a cyberattack on physical assets can also disrupt digital commands across the grid 's entire ecosystem , and similarly , an attack on a digital network can alter OT assets that could produce catastrophic physical damage . "" <p> Understanding the relationship between physical and digital assets when either one is given a command is "" the only way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being manipulated by attackers , "" explained Simonovich . With a unified IT and OT threat stream , utilities also gain the opportunity to unleash a powerful new cybersecurity tool : artificial intelligence . <p> A new security business model built around AI and machine learning <p> Siemens ' Process Security Analytics presents a breakthrough in applying artificial intelligence ( AI ) and machine learning to help the utility industry tackle two of its greatest challenges -- managing , detecting and responding to threats in real-time and security for edge assets . <p> Advertisement <p> With a unified IT and OT threat stream , utilities can now feed data from across the grid into a centralized and standardized format to quickly prioritize alerts and begin appropriate response activities for a range of threat scenarios . These potential threats can be hundreds of miles from one another and seemingly have no correlation , so in this new ecosystem , only the utility will be capable of detecting and acting on these threats . Unified data streams also enable "" digital twin "" technology that helps analysts understand how the system typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "" That 's why at Siemens , we 've created a managed detection response offering to not just provide a full picture of an ever-evolving OT threat landscape , but also a solution that uses AI to create a digital twin . This gives utilities the ability to compare any real-time abnormalities they detect against a digital replica of the system performing correctly , "" Simonovich added . <p> The ability to bring together OT and IT information with artificial intelligence also unlocks the potential to deploy AI analysis in relatively isolated systems . Siemens recent partnership with the AI company SparkCognition lets companies put AI defenders on the spot to secure both aging and edge assets -- like meters in the home , pumping stations in a pipeline , or car charging stations on the road . It leapfrogs conventional methods because it 's often impossible to have humans patch or constantly monitor these assets . <p> Machine learning trained to recognize normal operations can monitor continuously and intervene when anomalies occur -- even at sites usually disconnected from internet access . Unlike conventional defenses , AI-based systems predict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel threats crop up . That potency will be critical to defending systems with long periods between security updates . "" The whole aim is to bring edge assets to a baseline level of security using artificial intelligence -- even if they 're isolated , "" Simonovich said . <p> "" For the digitally connected assets , the AI and machine learning can be used to autonomously stop attacks in real-time . "" <p> The time is ripe for utilities to step out of their comfort zone and into the future <p> Energy companies are risk averse by necessity . It 's a safety and reliability business , so leaders may be skeptical of AI solutions . But with the combined pressures of the digital revolution , high stakes , and fast-moving consequences attacks , utilities are being forced out of their comfort zones . <p> Securing the new energy landscape will be the most important challenge facing utilities in the coming years . But there are reasons to be confident . Historically , the electricity sector does a good job of re-inventing itself new technologies and business models arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilities competed on safety and reliability , and now must compete on security too . <p> Today , utilities are increasingly able to arm themselves with an expanding toolkit for visibility , monitoring to proactively defend against the grid 's entire operating environment . This was n't the case only a few years ago . If the industry can embrace cybersecurity as its core function , it will both realize new business possibilities and a secure energy future . <p> WIRED is where tomorrow is realized . It is the essential source of information and ideas that make sense of a world in constant transformation . The WIRED conversation illuminates how technology is changing every aspect of our lives -- from culture to business , science to design . The breakthroughs and innovations that we uncover lead to new ways of thinking , new connections , and new industries ."

"<p> Another 16% believe that its greatest benefit is better enabling key strategic initiatives . Nearly two-thirds of respondents say that analytics play an important role in driving business strategy . <p> Companies now have access to more data than ever . Whether your independent software vendor ( ISV ) business is a start-up or an established company , data-driven insights can deliver significant business benefits . It 's like a roadmap to your company 's success . <p> Businesses collect a wealth of data every day , through customers ' mobile app usage , website traffic , interactions on social media and more . Companies must take advantage of this to deliver the experiences customers are looking for . If you 're not measuring it , it means that you 're ignoring the little nuggets of gold residing in your systems . <p> Here are the five top benefits of data analytics for an ISV : <p> * Finding new customers -- How does a young business find more customers ? Gathering data on how customers interact with a business 's website , mobile apps , social media pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allows you to begin targeting new prospective customers . Data such as purchase histories , product use information , and metrics on customer satisfaction are also helpful , enabling you to target your efforts in the right areas . <p> * Increasing customer retention -- Customer retention analytics can be used to create competitive advantage . For example , an ISV that develops an app can monitor the number of times people use the app each day , as well as the times that they are not likely to do so . You can increase customer retention rates through push notifications and in-app messaging , improve commitment and strengthen customer loyalty . Notifications may include announcing new features and updates and offering additional benefits on top of the advantages of the app . <p> * Improving customer service -- ISVs can improve engagement with customers by using analytics to monitor when users need assistance and which areas , or functionalities are queried regularly . Using this data , features and functionalities can be added to meet end-user expectations , which will drive up customer satisfaction and improve the user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Netflix , from creative and marketing to its phenomenally successful original content arm . The company uses analytics is to gain insight into its 130-million worldwide streaming subscribers base , optimising its market , and ultimately delivering a better product . <p> * A marked competitive advantage -- A major competitive advantage of data is that it provides a precise way to identify what is working well within certain elements of your company and then make strategic decisions based on this information . Tracking and analysing marketing data can help to inform a successful marketing strategy . Social data can help the marketing team within an ISV to identify high-performing content based on audience , trends on different platforms , and the effectiveness of a brand 's social media activity , allowing you to determine whether LinkedIn , Facebook , Twitter , or Instagram , or a combination , work best for your business . <p> * Predicting sales trends -- Cash flow is critical for ISVs , particularly in the start-up phase . That is why it is critical to have the ability to predict sales trends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , using algorithms and machine learning to identify the likelihood of future results based on historical information . Using data mining and modelling to make visualisations , you can more easily identify patterns and trends . Analysing data with artificial intelligence and machine learning can help you to identify threats and highlight opportunities . <p> What is the best way to analyse data ? <p> Data-driven decision making ( DDDM ) is simply information-based decision-making . It uses grouped historical information to analyse trends and make decisions for the future based on what has worked for the business in the past . It is valuable in making a business less vulnerable to risky decisions that go wrong . <p> How to apply DDDM <p> * By using data instead of emotion , it guards against your biases . <p> * It allows you to use data to clearly define key objectives . <p> * How you gather data is important . It must be embedded in your culture and carried out with discipline . <p> * Once your strategy and goals are set , you will then need to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you reach these goals . <p> * Once your strategy and goals are set , you will then need to ask the right data analysis questions so that you achieve these goals . <p> * Analyse and understand the data to ensure you make the right decisions . <p> * Verify the data and make sure you are on the right track . Do not be afraid to step back and to rethink your decisions . <p> * Use data visualisation software to enable your team to interpret the data and use it to make the right decisions . <p> * Be sure to apply the findings to business decisions and that you make decisions aligned with the company 's mission and vision . This is about turning the data into action ."
"<h> Is It Okay To Abandon Traditional Machine Learning Approaches ? <p> Modern machine learning or one can say deep learning algorithms , have become really good at multiple tasks . For example , object detection tasks have been overtaken by modern ML methods . <p> There is a growing understanding that larger models are "" easy "" to optimise in the sense that local methods , such as stochastic gradient descent ( SGD ) , converge to global minima of the training risk in over-parameterized regimes . Thus , it is believed that large interpolating models can have low test risk and be easy to optimise at the same time . <p> Appropriately chosen "" modern "" models usually outperform the optimal "" classical "" model on the test set . Another important practical advantage of over-parameterized models is in optimisation . <p> However , it is now common practice to fit highly complex models like deep neural networks to data with ( nearly ) zero training error , and yet these interpolating predictors are observed to have good out-of-sample accuracy even for noisy data . <h> Overview Of Bias-Variance Trade-Offs In ML <p> Bias is the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and variance refers to the algorithm 's sensitivity to specific sets of training data . Bias vs. variance refers to the accuracy vs. consistency of the models trained by the algorithm . <p> To build a good predictive model , one needs to find a balance between bias and variance that minimises the total error because : <p> Total Error = Bias2 + Variance + Irreducible Error <p> An optimal balance of bias and variance leads to a model that is neither overfitting nor underfitting . The predictor is commonly chosen from linear functions or neural networks with a certain architecture , using empirical risk minimisation ( ERM ) and its variants . <h> Bridging The Old And New <p> via Paper by Mikhail Belkin et al. , <p> The classical approach to understanding generalisation is based on bias-variance trade-offs , where model complexity is carefully calibrated so that they fit on the training sample reflects performance out-of-sample . <p> In an attempt to investigate the bias-variance tradeoff for neural networks and to shed more light on their generalisation properties , researchers at Ohio State University and Columbia University , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that extends the traditional U-shaped bias-variance curve beyond the point of interpolation . <p> The experimental results show that while the behaviour of SGD for more general neural networks are not fully understood , there is significant empirical and some theoretical evidence that a similar minimum norm inductive bias is present and averaging potentially non-smooth interpolating solutions leads to an interpolating solution with a higher degree of smoothness . <p> Above picture has a classical U-shaped risk curve arising from the bias-variance trade-off on the left and a e double descent risk curve , which incorporates the U-shaped risk curve ( i.e. , the "" classical "" regime ) together with the observed behavior from using high complexity function classes ( i.e. , the "" modern "" interpolating regime ) on the right . <p> The belief that a model with zero training error is overfit to the training data and will typically generalise poorly is very popular amongst ML practitioners . However , modern machine learning methods , nowadays , fit the training data perfectly or near-perfectly . For instance , highly complex neural networks and other non-linear predictors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training risk . <p> In spite of the high function class complexity and near-perfect fit to the training data , these predictors often give accurate predictions on new data . <p> This attempt to bridge the two regimes through fundamental statistics standpoint is to maintain the intuition around machine learning models intact . <h> Evolution On Other Fronts <p> Source : Sambit Mahapatra <p> As we discuss something as fundamental as reconciling bias-variance trade-offs in modern ML methods , research is being done in some unheard avenues . Questions such as whether backpropagation is necessary and what is the importance of feedback loops for recommendation engines are being asked . Robustness of a machine learning model is being achieved by introducing noise during training . Researchers have gone as far as preparing a model to train better . In short , energies are shifting from post-training and testing to pre-training strategies . <p> The algorithms get tweaked for trivialities every other day . The errors too , have kept on advancing . For instance , it has been demonstrated that reinforcement learning models can run into reward hacking problem out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has indeed fallen from the tree , traditional approaches still hold significance because one does n't always have to fancy too many deep learning layers or pre-trained BERT for something as simple as document classification ! <p> However , techniques like Yolo net take the image as input and provide the location and name of objects at the output . But in traditional ones like SVM , a bounding box object detection algorithm is required first to identify all possible objects to have the HOG ( histogram of oriented gradients ) as input to the learning algorithm in order to recognise relevant objects . <p> The histogram of oriented gradients ( HOG ) is a feature descriptor used in computer vision and image processing for the purpose of object detection . Feature descriptors describe elementary characteristics such as the shape , the colour , the texture or the motion , among others . <p> Though setting up a deep learning project uses up more resources than a typical SVMs ( support vector machines ) , they are really good at dealing with complex problems . Problems which have more features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intelligence ( AI ) has been the star technology over the past few years and it is easy to see why . From smartphones to PCs , some of the most game-changing applications are powered by AI . In addition to this , there is a groundswell of interest around applications like video recognition , speech recognition or object detection that will find use cases in smartphones , security and self-driving cars . <p> Many AI applications that we see in our day-to-day lives have become ubiquitous , for example , Facebook photo-tagging or virtual assistant on our smartphones . Gartner predicts the business value created by AI will reach $3.9 trillion in 2022 . Some of the use cases that will drive the maximum investment are intelligent automation on the enterprise side and product recommendations and digital assistants on the consumer end . Most of these compelling use cases depend on computational power and deep learning algorithms that will drive the next phase of growth in AI . <p> So , while the data science community is overwhelmed by AI 's possibilities , what 's often less clear is the underlying significance of the hardware layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why data scientists today demand a full-stack solution across hardware platforms , tools and libraries to enable ease of application development . We also look at the shifting revenue towards inference and the need for software/frameworks to utilise the power of the high-end processors . <h> AI Hardware &amp; Software Presents The Biggest Untapped Opportunity <p> Given the massive potential of AI , trendsetting companies have taken concrete steps to capture real value from AI and win in this market . End users of enterprise-AI and even consumer-AI expect AI systems to provide highly accurate outcomes and that too in near-real-time . The amount of data available for training these AI systems is increasing at a steady rate . While data availability is no longer a major bottleneck , the computing infrastructure -- hardware + software will be the key differentiator to meet the dual requirements of speed and accuracy . <p> In all business domains , the AI systems that provide state-of-the-art performance are all Deep Learning-based systems . These DL-based algorithms are extremely computationally intensive and have fuelled rapid advancements in the processor technology in general but more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The most crucial need for businesses today is to build highly accurate models . For an AI system to be highly accurate , the trained AI models need to be generalizable and the training infrastructure needs to be scalable to seamlessly ingest more data . In the next step , for AI system to make predictions in near-real-time , the inference infrastructure needs to have the appropriate computational sophistication . <h> Hardware Is The Key Differentiator In AI <p> Image for representation purpose <p> A typical data science infrastructure relies on a combination of GPUs and CPUs which are quite different architecturally . CPUs , the traditional workhorses of computing , are designed for efficient computation of complex operations whereas GPUs are best at simpler/elemental operations which need to be optimally repeated at a massive scale . GPUs started off as processors for better rendering of high fidelity graphics but have now grown on to be a class of their own . GPUs achieve the optimality through in-built parallelization . <p> Since AI system training is typically done on tens of millions of training samples , the same set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training samples and the same set of model parameters need to be updated over and over again . GPUs are thus most suited for these repetitive tasks . The parallelization provided by the GPUs also helps in completing these training tasks relatively quickly , which in turn helps in exploring many more training architectures . <h> Inference Will Drive The AI Market Forward <p> Model training and inference ( i.e. , prediction ) happen in very different contexts and hence their hardware requirements are also quite different . For example , inference typically happens on only a few samples at a time and that too these samples are captured across a wide variety of conditions , and hence there is n't enough parallelization to warrant a GPU . Thus , for inference , a CPU is preferred almost always . In terms of cost , GPUs are typically a lot more expensive than CPUs . Another key point one must remember is that inference typically happens on more diverse and less expensive devices ( like smartphones , drones , edge devices ) as compared to training , which typically happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the industry is working towards making GPUs the go-to-processors for inference . Among other things , iPhones now have GPUs . No doubt , going forward inference will become the biggest revenue contributor in AI . <h> What 's The Next Frontier In AI -- Cohesive Software Environment <p> Want to know why hardware enterprises are racing to build next-gen processors that are optimized with popular Deep Learning frameworks ? Data Scientists do n't want to spend time parsing high-level AI/ML code in a way that is consistent with the optimization of the corresponding hardware . Moreover , Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers are not necessarily trained in writing code which can inherently utilise the optimization capabilities of these CPUs/GPUs . <p> That 's why the next wave of innovations will come from AI frameworks that are developed around these different processors . To fully utilise the power of these high-end processors ( be it CPUs or GPUs ) , data scientists require software/framework . In fact , most data scientists and machine learning engineers do n't want to spend any extra effort acquiring these skills . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also have a wide array of necessary framework which can interpret and port the ' high-level ' AI/ML code into optimized routines which utilize all the capabilities of the underlying processors . <p> These speedup frameworks can either be provided by the creators of the processors themselves or by sponsoring communities of coders who will be contribute to these frameworks . <p> For example , some of the most popular frameworks used today are : <p> a ) clDNN library by Intel is a set of compute kernels to accelerate deep learning and AI models <p> b ) Intel ? MKL-DNN actively supported by Intel coding community for both CPUs and GPUs is the set of accelerators which is optimized for a variety of deep learning architectures but more so specifically for some of the popular ones like AlexNet , GoogleNet etc . <p> Finally , the next big push in the industry is towards building processors which are specifically optimized for certain kinds of AI workloads ( Nervana Neural Network Processor ( NNP-I ) and TPUs ) . <h> Bottomline <p> Semiconductor companies and AI computing players need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complexities and offers a wide appeal to the developer ecosystem . To win the developer community over , hardware players need to offer simpler interfaces and a suite of software platforms that is compatible with multiple compute architecture . Hardware companies should also think how to include application-specific capabilities that could see a high demand over the next few years ."

"<h> Using Epigenetic Signatures and Machine Learning to Improve Diagnosis <p> Greenwood Genetic Center ( GGC ) researchers in collaboration with scientists from Canada have identified unique epigenetic signatures for nine neurodevelopmental disorders lending to a better method of diagnosis for disorders with much clinical overlap . The epigenetic signatures were developed through methylation array analysis and were reported in the January issue of The American Journal of Human Genetics . <p> "" Many of the disorders we studied have clinical overlap , which makes sense as the genes causing each of these disorders all work within the same epigenetic machinery , determining the gene 's expression and expression of other genes , "" said Charles Schwartz , PhD , Director of Molecular Studies at GGC in Greenwood , SC who was a co-author of the study . "" What was interesting is that although the genes function is somewhat similar manners , nine of the disorders showed a unique epigenetic signature with minimal overlap . "" <p> The study authors suggest that these unique epigenetic signatures could be useful in concurrently screening for multiple syndromes with a high degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of overlap between these signatures , the team concludes that a single machine learning classification tool built on the combined signatures of these disorders , can accurately make the diagnosis . This method not only distinguished these nine disorders from one another , but also assigned low probability scores to patients with other forms of intellectual and/or developmental delay . <p> In addition , these unique signatures could also provide an innovative approach in solving ambiguous cases presenting with variants of uncertain significance from targeted gene sequencing , whole exome sequencing or whole genome sequencing . <p> "" Our results also led to the development of an epigenetic echo model for how these syndrome-specific signatures arise and are maintained , "" said Schwartz . <p> "" The echo model states that while an initial epigenetic dysfunction arises during early development , an broader methylation legacy or echo remains throughout the genome leading to the unique signature .

"<h> The pharmacy of the future <h> Building the pharmacy of the future ? Rob Sztar describes the technology you need to know about <p> We are fortunate to be living through the 3rd Industrial Revolution , otherwise known as the Digital Revolution or the Information Age , where we 've witnessed landmark events such as the origin of the internet , mobile phone , and cloud computing , all in the last 30 years ! Consider this : The world 's largest taxi firm , Uber , owns no cars . The world 's most popular media company , Facebook , creates no content . <p> The world 's most valuable retailer , Alibaba , carries no stock . And the world 's largest accommodation provider , Airbnb , owns no property . All made possible by the same technology we have access to today ! The world we live in is changing at an exponential pace of change , and I know many of you are simply overwhelmed when thinking about integrating technology into your pharmacy business or believe that the ground swell of technological innovation surrounding us is impenetrable to the current traditional pharmacy model . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future of technology innovation , by showing you how you can start implementing some of the earliest versions in your pharmacy today . <p> The patient journey of tomorrow arrives today <p> Once upon a time , the only ways for a patient to engage with their pharmacist for advice and pharmaceutical products/services was through the telephone and the front-door of their closest community pharmacy . Month after Month they would visit , which gave rise to the close , personal , trusted relationships that we love to nurture and create . This is our biggest strength moving into the future , but its strength will be tested by our ability to support our current and future patients in developing our presence in pure digital environments like Virtual Reality and environments where digital meets the physical in Augmented Reality ( e.g Pokemon Go ) . <p> One example is through engaging with connected devices such as the SIMband . This evolutionary device includes six types of biological sensors which can continuously monitor your body and its vital signs to support preventative medicine and predict health events before our patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our decision support systems powered by artificial intelligence such as IBM Watson , who in 2016 is already beginning to assist doctors in the Mayo Clinic ( USA ) and pharmacists at CVS Pharmacy ( USA ) . <p> The patient journey will forever cross both digital and physical boundaries ( often simultaneously ) , and as their trusted primary healthcare advisor we will gain continued relevance by our ability to support them anywhere and anytime . The key take-away from this is that this is an evolutionary journey which will progress at the speed of our patients aspirations and the adoption of technology in our healthcare system . To ready ourselves and take advantage of current opportunities in these areas , ensure that you : <p> Over our community pharmacy journeys , we 've seen the level of profit from the timely supply of medicines slowly dwindling , leaving less margin for the cross-subsidisation of essential ( but free ) pharmaceutical services . Yet despite this , our supply workflows and management of key business metrics largely remain in the same reactive and inefficient state . The pharmacy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the supply chain through predictive supply of pre-packaged medicines , on-demand medicine personalisation which will include : 3D printing of medicines in pharmacies , and delivery of adaptive medicine devices that respond to individual treatment goals . <p> Globally , we 're already seeing large fulfillment businesses like Amazon ( US ) obtain patents for ' anticipatory shipping ' in the re-supply of products to customers before they 've decided to place an order , and closer to home , Lloydspharmacy ( UK ) controversially begun operating an automated distribution centre challenging the existing pharmacy dispensary model through a ' hub and spoke ' setup . Essentially , this is an advanced method for decoupling product logistics from our clinical interactions with patients , leaving greater scope for further strengthening and developing our role in professional services delivery . <p> Fortunately , we have access to patient engagement and smart data analytical software that allows us to begin this transition at a fraction of the complexity and cost : <p> The available tools ( e.g MedAdvisor , Healthnotes , MemoCare , and eRx Express ) provide our patients with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered in a way that suits them ( email , SMS , landline , or push notification ) . <p> Utilise predictive tools such as ' Script Tracker ' ( provided by Healthnotes ) to forecast our patients medication requirements assisting us in ordering/managing our inventory as well as proactively support patients who may have slipped through the cracks and may be struggling with completing their treatment . <p> The workforce of the future <p> With an in-depth report recently released from Oxford University , on the future of employment predicting that 35 per cent of jobs are at risk of automation in the next 20 years , we need to take a moment to consider the roles required in our pharmacies of the future . As we 've already discussed , our own roles as pharmacists will transform to support the omnichannel ( physical &amp; digital ) patient through entry into new environments and redefining existing pharmacy business workflows . <p> Does this mean the end of the road for our teams of administrative , pharmacy and dispensary assistants ? No , but only where they possess or can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both physical and digital platforms , and are agile enough to innovate and adopt technology . Digital pharmacy environments of the future will include ' chatbots ' that intelligently communicate with our patients through artificial intelligence , but in synchronous existence will be the need to communicate and engage with our patients when they visit the pharmacy in-person . Our teams will need to work together with the digital versions of ourselves , much the same way we do right now with : <p> ' Pharmacist Phil ' ( from MedAdvisor ) and other automated communication methods ( SMS and Email ) 02now , to deliver a consistent and remarkable level of patient care across all channels . <p> Another example for your early consideration is inviting a dispensary robot onto your existing team to automate and assist in the ongoing management of the complex inventory processes and workflows to enable your pharmacists and support team to freely interact with each patient the moment they step foot through your physical or digital front doors . <p> Now you may be feeling a little uneasy when contemplating your first steps forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly the right place in preparing to move out of your comfort zone . "" You can only grow if you are willing to feel awkward and uncomfortable when you try something new "" ( - Brian Tracy ) . My personal belief is that there has never been a better time to be a pharmacist and to build the pharmacy of the future in partnership with technology , as it enables closer , more meaningful pharmacist contributions than at anytime in our history . <p> Robert Sztar is a 2nd generation pharmacist , pharmacy owner , and the founder of Pharmactive .

"<p> MOUNTAIN VIEW , California , Jan. 7 , 2020 /CNW/ -- Groq , the inventor of the Tensor Streaming Processor ( TSP ) architecture and a new class of compute , today announced that the Groq processor has achieved 21,700 inferences per second ( IPS ) for ResNet-50 v2 inference . Groq 's level of inference performance exceeds that of other commercially available neural network architectures , with throughput that more than doubles the ResNet-50 score of the incumbent GPU-based architecture . ResNet-50 is an inference benchmark for image classification and is often used as a standard for measuring performance of machine learning accelerators . <p> In addition , earlier this week , the Linley Group released its latest Microprocessor Report titled "" Groq Rocks Neural Networks , "" which concludes that Groq 's "" TSP stands out in both peak performance and ResNet-50 throughput , "" and that "" Groq 's deep-learning accelerator is the fastest available on the merchant market . "" <p> Significantly , the Groq platform does n't require large batch sizes for optimal inference processing performance , with the TSP architecture achieving peak throughput even at batch size 1 , when processing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and efficiently process small batch sizes is especially important to minimize latency in real-time applications . While Groq 's architecture is up to 2.5 times faster than GPU-based platforms at large batch sizes , its tensor streaming processor is up to 17 times faster at batch size 1 . <p> With the Groq architecture providing more than a 2x performance advantage over GPU-based solutions , engineering managers can deploy processing platforms that offer twice the inference performance without doubling infrastructure costs . Reducing the number of deployed systems can also save datacenter space , lower power usage , and decrease system complexity overall ."

"<p> NANJING - A robust regulatory framework that builds public trust and promotes experimentation and innovation is a key factor that will encourage the adoption of artificial intelligence ( AI ) technologies , said Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat on Friday ( June 1 ) . <p> This will enable , rather than stifle , innovation , and can also help level the playing field , allowing start-ups with innovative ideas to compete , he added . <p> Such a framework was cited by Mr Heng at a forum here on artificial intelligence as one of three "" enablers "" that will help bring about the adoption of AI across the economy and society . <p> The other two enablers are investing in research and development , and promoting the acceptance of AI among the public . <p> Mr Heng also drew attention to "" regulatory sandboxes "" in Singapore . They allow the Government to have a keen understanding of emerging technologies and new business models while staying alert to potential risks . <p> In a regulatory sandbox , legal and regulatory requirements are relaxed , so firms can test bed their solutions in real but contained environments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this for autonomous vehicles and the Monetary Authority of Singapore does this for fintech , Mr Heng said , as he invited businesses and entrepreneurs from China to test bed their solutions in Singapore 's regulatory sandboxes . <p> He said there was also potential for Singapore and China companies to form partnerships and test bed AI technologies in Asean cities . <p> "" Good regulatory policies build public trust . For technologies to receive widespread acceptance , the public must be convinced that their safety , privacy and data are safeguarded , "" he said . <p> "" Some may see this as counter-intuitive , as rules and regulations may be more traditionally known to stifle , rather than enable , innovation , "" he said . <p> Mr Heng , who is in China on a working visit , delivered the opening address at the inaugural Sino-Singapore Artificial Intelligence Forum held at the Singapore Nanjing Eco Hi-Tech Island , a development zone located on an island in the middle of the Yangtze River . <p> He noted that in research and development , the National Research Foundation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic product each year with good results . <p> In terms of promoting the acceptance of AI , the young must also have a strong foundation of skills and knowledge so they are ready for the "" AI-enabled economy of the future "" , he said . <p> In Singapore , secondary schools introduced computer studies as a subject in 2006 , while China recently released an AI textbook for high-school students . <p> Singapore 's Nanyang Technological University is also launching a new degree programme in data science and AI . <p> In his speech to about 350 AI experts and professionals , Mr Heng also touched on the transformative potential of AI to synthesise large amounts of information , improve lives and raise productivity . <p> This was especially important for countries such as Singapore and China that have ageing populations and slowing labour force growth , he said . <p> "" The economic potential is significant , "" said Mr Heng , citing a recent study by consulting firm McKinsey estimating that AI could create US$3.5 trillion ( S$4.7 trillion ) to US$5.8 trillion in annual value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promising , but to realise the potential , governments , businesses , academia and the public have to work together , "" he said . <p> The one-day forum , which aims to attract AI companies and experts to move to Nanjing and the island , was organised by the Nanjing government and the Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence . <p> Mr Heng arrived in China on Thursday for a nine-day working visit .

"<h> Digital transformation -- a disruptive force for all sectors of the economy <p> 28 May 2019 <p> Digital transformation is going mainstream . Today it has widespread application across different industries . Companies of all stripes are discussing technology investment and the opportunities available for investors and for businesses . Walter Price of Allianz Technology Trust explains . <p> Amid the drama of 2018 's technology markets , one sector showed notable resilience : enterprise software . This was no accident , these companies are geared into a major shift in the way the corporate sector manages its technology needs . This ' digital transformation ' ( tackling traditional problems with digital technology ) is dramatically changing industries from the healthcare to consumer sectors and beyond . In 2018 , more companies woke up to the potential gains from a digital strategy . <h> What is digital transformation ? <p> The definition of digital transformation strategies will be as disparate as the companies that employ them . However , at its heart , it involves rethinking existing business models and processes through the use of technology . As such , it may incorporate many aspects of technology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computing and software-as-a-service . <p> For example , moving to software as a service and cloud computing as part of a digital transformation lets companies circumvent a costly upgrade cycle . Rather than having to support expensive in-house technology capability , they can pick and mix their technology requirements to suit their business requirements . They can move data storage to the cloud and buy their software on a subscription basis . This means companies do n't have to anticipate years in advance or commit significant capital to technology infrastructure , bringing invaluable flexibility . <h> Why did digitisation fast-track in 2018 ? <p> Adoption of digital transformation strategies accelerated this year . Until relatively recently , mid-sized companies had been eager adopters of the cloud computing , but larger companies -- possibly because of greater implementation challenges -- had been more reluctant . <p> However , these companies are increasingly recognising that it is a major competitive disadvantage to lag on digital transformation . At the same time , companies had more cash to direct to these transformation programmes as a result of the US administration 's tax cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offshore at lower tax rates and reinvest it . <p> Cloud computing continues to get cheaper and its functionality is improving , notably with new artificial intelligence options . The most recent ' LogicMonitor 's Cloud Vision 2020 : The Future of the Cloud ' Study found that 50% of IT professionals believe artificial intelligence and machine learning are playing a role in cloud computing adoption today , growing to 67% by 2020 . <p> Increasingly , enterprises can not overlook the efficiency gains from a move to the cloud , particularly when compared to upgrading legacy hardware and software . Upgrading legacy systems may achieve a 10-15% productivity improvement , compared to 50% for switching to a new architecture . This makes it harder for companies to ignore . CEOs continue to be focused on transforming their businesses and making them more efficient . This is a necessity in many cases to stay responsive to their customers . <p> This transformation is still in its early stages and is unlikely to be derailed . In many cases , companies are transitioning from decades-old software and the new software they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades to come . For investors , this means that the return from these companies is less cyclical and more like a long-term annuity . <h> Entering the mainstream <p> Digital transformation is going mainstream . Today it has widespread application across different industries . Companies of all stripes are discussing technology investment and the opportunities available . <p> In healthcare , for example , electronic health records , digital imaging and e-prescription services have been integrated into existing IT systems for large healthcare organisations across the globe . There is also the increasing use of ' telemedicine ' -- apps providing immediate consultations for minor health complaints , important for rural areas with poor access to medical facilities . At the consumer healthcare end , we are seeing the adoption of wearable health monitoring devices , which increasingly feed into health insurance assessments . <p> In retail , digital technologies are being used to improve the customer experience , to tailor and guide their preferences and to prevent ' spamming ' them with products they are never likely to buy . PwC research shows that only 4% of UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides unsatisfactory experiences1 . Retailers need to get it right first time , or risk losing customers for good . <h> The beneficiaries <p> There are a number of different types of companies benefiting from this trend . There are the large cloud providers , where pricing benefits from economies of scale -- Amazon , Google , Microsoft . They are taking share in the cloud market . At the same time , there are the smaller Software-as-a-Service providers . This would include names such as ServiceNow , whose offering includes enterprise platform-as-a-service management software for human resources , law , facilities management , finance , marketing , and field operations . <p> Salesforce.com is the largest of the SaaS companies , focused on customer relationship management software . Paycom and Workday are other holdings in this area . These companies are moving into horizontal applications in areas such as marketing management . The tools needed to build the infrastructure are generic and can be used for a wide range of different purposes . Now these companies have built the infrastructure , they can customise it to create a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are seeing SaaS infrastructure packaged up with industry knowledge to solve major problems . One of the companies in our portfolio , Veeva Systems , has built cloud-based systems specifically for the life sciences industry . They take on the administration process for drug approvals for healthcare companies . This means companies can focus on finding and making drugs . <h> Legacy technology <p> This transformation also has implications for legacy technology as well . Where it is coming to the end of its lifecycle , companies can no longer rely on renewals . Newer technology is constantly improving , delivering greater productivity improvements at lower and lower cost . With each upgrade cycle those companies not transforming are become less competitive . In a recent report McKinsey said : "" Only 8% of companies we surveyed said their current business model would remain economically viable ' if their industry keeps digitising at its current course and speed ' . 1 <h> A solution to the productivity puzzle <p> Part of the reason companies need to embrace digitisation is for productivity enhancements . Another McKinsey report ' Solving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of digitisation ' noted that digitisation "" promises significant productivity-boosting opportunities but the benefits have not yet materialised at scale . This is due to adoption barriers and lag effects as well as transition costs . "" 2 <p> In our view , enterprises will progressively be forced to overcome these barriers as the competitive environment demands it . This suggests that the digital transformation has a considerable way to run , which should continue to support those cloud computing and software-as-a-service companies that benefit from it . <h> Products <h> What Investment Magazine <p> What Investment is the premier magazine in the UK for private investors , exploring opportunities across the market , seeking out the best funds , shares and ideas .

CFIUS is the U.S. Department of the Treasury-led interagency committee that advises the president on the national security implications of foreign investments in the U.S. economy . While FIRRMA is not yet fully in effect , as the Treasury Department is still working on regulations that will implement the law and that likely will not become final until February 2020 , it is very clear that FIRRMA means that far more transactions will now likely be subject to CFIUS review . As Israeli investors consider investments in the United States , the question of whether a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early action item on the due diligence checklist . <p> CFIUS has its roots in the 1970s , when President Gerald Ford established the committee to respond to fears that OPEC investments in the U.S. economy were threatening national security . While these fears eventually passed , Japanese investments in the 1980s sparked new fears , resulting in congressional passage of the Exon-Florio law , which granted the president the power to block proposed or pending foreign "" mergers , acquisitions , or takeovers "" that threatened to impair national security . Then , in the wake of 9/11 , congressional fears shifted back to Arabs culminating in the political firestorm caused by Dubai Ports World 's proposed takeover of the U.S. maritime terminal operations of P&amp;O Ports . Responding to this fear , Congress enacted the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007 ( FINSA ) , which broadened CFIUS jurisdiction to include transactions involving critical infrastructure and established the CFIUS process that is known today . <p> Now , there is a new concern Chinese efforts to use investments and acquisitions to obtain cuttingedge U.S. technologies such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militarily , overtake us economically , undermine U.S. cyber networks , compromise critical infrastructure , spy on U.S. government installations and steal the personal data of Americans . Because of these very real fears , and even before the enactment of FIRRMA , both the Obama and Trump administrations used CFIUS to block or discourage a number of Chinese investments involving U.S. companies , including several involving semiconductors ( Lumileds , Aixtron and Lattice ) . Both administrations also used CFIUS to prevent or require major divestments in transactions involving personal information ( Moneygram ) , critical infrastructure ( COSCO/Orient Overseas ) and real estate near sensitive U.S. government facilities ( Waldorf Astoria , HNA Manhattan ) . And fears of China also motivated the Trump Administration to use CFIUS to block Broadcom 's hostile takeover of Qualcomm out of concerns that Broadcom might hurt Qualcomm 's leadership in the development of 5G technology , thereby opening the door for Chinese firm Huawei to win the contest for global 5G domination . <p> Passed by bipartisan House and Senate majorities , FIRRMA is the next step in the evolution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking to invest in U.S. companies ? <p> First : For many transactions , the basics of pre-FIRRMA law remain and will remain in place . CFIUS will still come into play for any acquisition that would result in control of a U.S. business by a foreign person , and where that transaction might impact U.S. national security . These concepts are broadly and expansively defined under the law , so as to give CFIUS and the president maximum flexibility in acting to protect the American public . <p> For example , "" control "" does not just mean majority ownership . Rather , the law expansively defines it more broadly to include the direct or indirect power to "" determine , direct , or decide important matters affecting an entity . "" So , in many cases , the purchase of a minority stake by a foreign investor can be viewed by CFIUS as tantamount to foreign "" control . "" So Israeli investors should not believe that by acquiring only 49 percent of a U.S. business , they can escape CFIUS review . <p> A "" U.S. business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in interstate commerce in the United States , "" even persons or companies based elsewhere , but with a branch , subsidiary or other significant operations in the U.S. For example , an Israeli-owned company with a U.S.-based branch or subsidiary would likely be deemed a "" U.S. business "" for CFIUS purposes . So , as a result , a Chinese investment in the Israeli parent company would likely trigger a need for United States CFIUS review , where the investment conceivably impacts U.S. national security . Conversely , per the Treasury Department 's longstanding regulations , if a U.S. business has an Israeli subsidiary that is majorityowned and therefore controlled by the U.S. business , that Israeli company is also deemed part of the U.S. business , and not deemed a "" foreign "" person or entity under CFIUS . So if that majority U.S.owned and controlled Israeli subsidiary invests in a different U.S. business , it likely would not be deemed a foreign investor under CFIUS . <p> And finally , the concept of whether a foreign investment impacts "" national security "" is equally broad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to block or require modification of a potential foreign investment , the president may consider a wide variety of factors relevant to U.S. national security . Those factors may include U.S. defense and foreign policy needs , whether the transaction could impact U.S. technological leadership in areas impacting national security and whether the transaction relates to U.S. critical infrastructure , among many others . <p> So , in sum CFIUS jurisdiction has always been extraordinarily broad , and FIRRMA has made it even broader , as discussed in further detail below . <p> In most circumstances ( except those listed below ) , CFIUS is a voluntary process , so parties to such a transaction can roll the dice and hope CFIUS does n't come calling . But usually that 's bad advice , as there is no statute of limitations to the president 's power to unravel a transaction . So , if the parties decide not to make a voluntary CFIUS filing , there is nothing to stop CFIUS from knocking on their door , even many years after a transaction has closed . <p> So the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national security is to employ CFIUS counsel to submit a detailed notice to CFIUS before closing , asking the committee to review the transaction . It is , of course , possible that , upon review of the proposed transaction , CFIUS may have concerns and advise the president to block it or work with the parties to mitigate those concerns through divestment , management controls or other measures . But if CFIUS clears the transaction , the transaction will be given a "" safe harbor "" from future CFIUS review . And , except in rare cases where the parties have lied to CFIUS or where they have materially breached any mitigation agreements they have reached with the committee , the parties can go forward without the fear that CFIUS will later seek to unravel the deal . <p> Second : FIRRMA has now substantially expanded CFIUS jurisdiction to cover certain other transactions not necessarily resulting in foreign control . In these cases , even small minority stakes can trigger CFIUS review . The expanded CFIUS jurisdiction includes foreign investments in U.S. businesses involved in a ) critical infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or maintenance of personal data on U.S. citizens , if the foreign investor is given access to material nonpublic technical information , membership or observer rights on the board , or any involvement in substantial decisionmaking concerning the U.S. business . In such circumstances and with certain limited exceptions , a CFIUS filing will be mandatory and substantial penalties can be imposed for failure to file . <p> As noted , many of these changes have not yet gone into effect regulations currently are being drafted by the Treasury Department that will implement this part of the FIRRMA law . On Sept. 17 , 2019 , the Treasury Department issued two sets of proposed regulations one addressing the expansion of CFIUS jurisdiction , with particular focus on the areas listed above , and the other specifically dealing with the expansion of CFIUS jurisdiction on real estate investments . Consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act , the Treasury Department is seeking public comment on the proposed regulations and , after considering these comments , it will develop and release final regulations implementing FIRRMA no later than Feb. 13 , 2020 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide a glimpse into how expansive CFIUS jurisdiction will become by early 2020 . Indeed , we have already felt the impact of this expanded jurisdiction , with the "" Pilot Program "" that CFIUS launched last year , implementing the new law with regard to foreign investments in U.S. businesses involved in critical technologies in 27 Pilot Program Industries , including aviation , defense , semiconductors , telecommunications , among others . Under this Pilot Program , for certain investments involving critical technologies , CFIUS filings are now mandatory and must be filed at least 45 days prior to closing , or else draconian penalties can be imposed . And once the Treasury Department finalizes its regulations implementing the rest of FIRRMA , more transactions will be subject to such mandatory filings . <p> Importantly , however , the definition of "" critical technology "" is still evolving . Under FIRRMA , critical technologies include those subject to export control license requirements ( such as those on the U.S. Munitions List / ITAR , on the Commerce Control List , nuclear technologies , and select agents and toxins ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also include those deemed "" emerging "" or "" foundational "" categories that , under the concurrently enacted Export Control Reform Act of 2018 ( ECRA ) , the U.S. Commerce Department is currently reviewing . In November 2018 , the Commerce Department issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking , which lists a number of technologies that might ultimately be deemed "" emerging "" under ECRA and FIRRMA ( "" foundational "" technologies will be addressed at a future date ) , including certain biotechnologies , artificial intelligence and machine learning , certain microprocessor technologies , among others . The Commerce Department asked for public comment on its list , and the final list is still under consideration . Depending on this final list of technologies , as well as the ultimate regulations implementing FIRRMA that will be finalized by the Treasury Department early next year , this could also dramatically broaden the scope of CFIUS reviews . <p> FIRRMA and the Treasury Department 's proposed regulations regarding such "" other "" investments also offer an additional twist that may be of significant interest to Israeli investors . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of CFIUS jurisdiction to noncontrolling investments with regard to certain "" excepted "" investors or foreign states namely , investors with clean records of compliance with U.S. laws and from countries deemed sufficiently friendly to the United States to present less of a national security risk . Such investors would not be exempt from CFIUS jurisdiction with regard to investments resulting in foreign control of a U.S. business , but conceivably could escape the expanded CFIUS jurisdiction for certain other noncontrolling investments . That said , the proposed regulations issued on Sept. 17 , 2019 , are just a tease . The Treasury Department says it will consider this issue further over the coming months . Needless to say , the evolving concept of "" excepted "" investors or foreign states could be one of major significance to Israeli investors . <p> Third : FIRRMA clarified that CFIUS does not have jurisdiction over indirect foreign investments through U.S. investment funds in businesses involved in critical infrastructure , critical technology or the collection of personal data on U.S. citizens , so long as the foreign investment is entirely passive . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general partner must have exclusive control of the investment fund , the foreign investors must not have any ability to control the fund or its investment decisions and the foreign investor must not have access to material nonpublic technical information . If those conditions are met , a U.S. investment fund 's investments in U.S. businesses will not trigger CFIUS review even if foreigners are investors in the fund . <p> Fourth : FIRRMA basically codifies existing CFIUS practice that has subjected certain real estate transactions to CFIUS review , if the subject property is located within an airport or seaport , or if the subject property is in "" close proximity "" of a military installation or other sensitive U.S. government facility , which could provide the opportunity for the foreign investor to collect intelligence on sensitive U.S. government activities impacting national security . These provisions will become effective once the Treasury Department regulations implementing FIRRMA with regard to real estate transactions become final in February 2020 , but for most intents and purposes , this is a continuation of prior practice although the proposed regulations issued on Sept. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to how these provisions will operate . In one important respect , however , the new law does significantly expand CFIUS jurisdiction by including within its ambit both developed and undeveloped real estate . So , certain "" greenfield "" investments will now trigger CFIUS review , if they are in "" close proximity "" of a sensitive U.S. government site . <p> Fifth : FIRRMA provides that CFIUS has jurisdiction to review investments clearly designed to circumvent CFIUS review a catch-all provision that reflects the concern that certain foreign investors were cleverly structuring their deals to avoid the letter of CFIUS law . <p> In addition to these substantive changes , FIRRMA also revised various CFIUS procedural rules , deadlines and filing fees , among other things . <p> Long and short , FIRRMA has changed the game on CFIUS reviews , and Israeli investors need to keep these new rules front of mind . Once fully implemented early next year , FIRRMA will dramatically expand the types of transactions subject to CFIUS review . In particular , for those involving critical infrastructure , critical technology or personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transactions near sensitive U.S. government facilities . CFIUS will come into play even for certain minority investments , and filings will now be mandatory in many cases . <p> Will this expansion of CFIUS jurisdiction be a huge obstacle to Israeli investments in the United States ? It is difficult to say . Politically , FIRRMA was all about fears of China , and CFIUS is clearly scrutinizing Chinese investments more carefully . As a result , Chinese investment in the U.S. is down dramatically by 95 percent compared to only two years ago . This is obviously significant . But for most transactions not involving Chinese investors , the new CFIUS rules should not stand as a huge obstacle . Indeed , Israeli investors should begin to pull together arguments regarding the provisions in FIRRMA and in the proposed regulations concerning "" excepted "" investors and foreign states making the argument that they should be excepted from much of the expanded CFIUS jurisdiction , given Israel 's close friendship with the United States . But even aside from this new potential twist , the new CFIUS rules should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not usually a fatal one , assuming the parties have employed experienced CFIUS counsel to navigate them through the process and , if necessary , negotiate with CFIUS to forestall a block or minimize any mitigation or divestment requirements . Bottom line , given the expansion of CFIUS jurisdiction , the question of CFIUS review must now be an early topic in the due diligence process for any transaction . In any case potentially triggering CFIUS review , experienced CFIUS counsel should be brought in early to assist the parties in evaluating whether a mandatory filing is required or a voluntary one is advisable . The CFIUS question can not wait until the last minute . But again , with experienced CFIUS counsel in the mix , the vast majority of transactions will proceed unscathed . <p> "" This is a very good resource and I appreciate receiving it everyday .

For more thought pieces from the industry , please see here . <p> As engineers we now need to do more than simply design and construct . <p> Increasingly engineers may need to help steer and optimise technology . Photo from iStockPhoto.com . <p> An engineer 's role does n't stop once a piece of infrastructure has been built . We are expected to understand the implications of the future operation and maintenance of our assets . <p> As the world faces some of its biggest challenges - eradicating poverty , mitigating and adapting to climate change - the world 's supply of engineering skills is falling short . <p> A UNESCO study estimates that 2.5 million new engineers and technicians would have been needed from 2010 to 2015 in sub-Saharan Africa alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of improved access to clean water and sanitation . The region fell well short of this ambition - and is still falling . <p> Europe also faces a labour shortage . For example , Engineering UK reported in 2016 that engineering companies will require 182,000 people with engineering skills in the UK each year to 2022 . The number of graduates and apprentices entering the engineering industry will also need to double . <p> Automation and artificial intelligence ( AI ) could address some skills shortages but concern is sometimes expressed that in advancing technology ( such as automation of design work or advanced robotics ) we hand over too much control . <p> Or that we create disproportionate opportunities for some highly skilled workers and owners of capital while replacing the labour of some less skilled workers with machines . <p> Does this mean we 're developing ourselves out of jobs as engineers ? <p> No . Using automation and AI to undertake routine functions could free up our supply of engineers for more creative tasks . Our engineers would control and steer the algorithmic optimisations set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for global development . <p> Automation and AI could benefit areas in great need of development but with low numbers of engineers . In earthquake-prone areas with unengineered buildings we could automate safer building details and monitor building performance through sensors . This would help engineers who are there to review and focus on creating improvements and new developments rather than using what limited engineering talent we have to address basic problems . <p> We as engineers are well aware of the benefits of delivering integrated waste , energy and transport networks - from efficiency savings and productivity gains for operators though to improved services for users . But optimising this joined-up approach requires greater sophistication in our ability to process , analyse and act upon complex data in real time . <p> Machines will be better than us at this - but that requires us to be able to write the control algorithms and understand the wider context for optimising infrastructure service delivery . <p> Developing roles such as network engineers and integrators <p> Perhaps we should not just consider ourselves as designers or contractors in isolated roles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and ' integrators ' . With this shift in the perceived role of the engineer our engineering education and future skills pipeline would also need to adapt . <p> With the rise of computing power , automation and AI , we do n't need to develop engineers to repeat calculations from standard practice . We need to recruit and train them to collaborate with other sectors and exploit new technologies and skills . <p> We need to campaign for engineers who understand how to make technology work for the people and the wider environment that it impacts . <p> Technology has no ethics so we need broad and globally minded engineers to make optimal human decisions . <p> This is not a case for removing the infrastructure engineer . It 's a case of thinking about how best to apply our skills in very different scenarios.HuffPost UK Tech is running a two-week focus on our Tech For Good campaign , which aims to highlight the technology that is driving social change and making a positive , long-lasting difference to our world .

"<h> Share this story <p> On January 16th , Facebook users received an error message when posting in Jinghpaw , a language spoken by Myanmar 's ethnic Kachin and written with a Roman alphabet . "" We could n't post this . Tap for more info , "" the message said . When clicking , a second appeared : "" Your request could n't be processed . There was a problem with this request . We 're working on getting it fixed as soon as we can . "" <p> A Facebook representative told The Verge that the issue was caused by "" a bug in our language infrastructure , "" and coincided with the launch , the same day , of an updated language identification model supporting ten new languages , including Jinghpaw . The representative said Facebook fixed the issue within hours of receiving reports on January 17th . <p> "" For the Kachin , there are forces looking to monitor any expressions of resistance "" <p> But while the disabling of Jinghpaw was not an active move of censorship , it alerted many Kachin people that Facebook had the capability to identify their language , an alarming thought for the embattled minority group . That realization has evoked a visceral reaction from the Kachin , and brought forth new calls for the company to be more transparent about its technology and the ways it will be used . <p> "" For the Kachin , there are forces looking to monitor any expressions of resistance against the state 's narratives , "" said Kachin resident Ja Htoi Pan . "" I would like to see more transparency regarding Facebook 's social media monitoring process in Myanmar . "" <p> For the Kachin , a predominantly Christian minority living in the northernmost state of the Buddhist-majority country , feelings of oppression are strong . The Myanmar government does not officially recognize the Kachin national flag or allow it to be raised at state-sponsored events , replacing it with their own version . In the past two years , five Kachin activists were jailed in cases related to freedom of expression , and in September , the Myanmar military threatened charges , later dropped , against an influential Kachin Baptist reverend after he told President Trump that Christians in Myanmar were being "" oppressed and tortured by the Myanmar military government . "" <p> In the third quarter of 2019 , Facebook removed 7 million pieces of hate speech content <p> That history of marginalization and civil war has left many Kachin wary of even the smallest hints of surveillance . Experts estimate that there are roughly 1.1 million mother-tongue Jinghpaw speakers -- a tiny sliver in a nation of over 50 million -- and crackdowns on speech have sometimes been a prelude to more troubling measures . Institutionalized monitoring and censorship were the norm in Myanmar under the military regime , which transitioned to a more democratic rule in 2011 . Online defamation is still criminalized and the law is often used by government officials and the military to silence dissent . "" The government has recently taken on the mobile internet at large , with one still-expanding shutdown , with one still-expanding shutdown in place since June 2019 in a conflict-torn area on the opposite side of the country from Kachin . <p> Facebook gained widespread attention in relation to Myanmar following mass violence against Rohingya Muslims in late 2017 . The company has since invested heavily in its Myanmar-focused operations , and now has more than 100 Myanmar-speaking content reviewers and the ability to review content in some of the country 's ethnic languages , including Jinghpaw . Since that time , Facebook has also removed hundreds of pages that violate their community standards , and banned the Myanmar military 's commander-in-chief from the site . <p> Today , Facebook 's content moderation is increasingly done through automated flagging and removal . In the third quarter of 2019 , Facebook removed 7 million pieces of hate speech content from its global platform , with 80 percent caught proactively using artificial intelligence . During congressional hearings in April 2018 , when Mark Zuckerberg was questioned on Facebook 's failure to effectively stop hate speech in relation to the Rohingya crisis , he suggested that artificial intelligence would "" be the scalable way to identify and root out most of this harmful content . "" <p> Yet many Kachin are concerned about the ways the technology will be used . When finding they could not post in Jinghpaw without knowing the reason , many were outraged . "" Sooner or later , Facebook is going to systematically monitor ethnic users , to see whether our posts are politically sensitive , "" said one member of the Kachin public named Labya La Doi . <p> Facebook plans to launch a new oversight board this summer , including provisions to include a member from the affected region in each moderation decision . But it remains to be seen how well versed those board members will be in the concerns of smaller minority groups such as the Kachin . <p> Ms. Yin Yadanar Thein , director of the rights group Free Expression Myanmar , said much of Facebook 's data and activities in the country remain opaque . "" We encourage Facebook to be more transparent . Facebook has so much power in Myanmar , but the public knows almost nothing about the decisions it is making . As a result , nobody really knows how much content is removed or why . "" <p> When asked for Myanmar-specific data on content removal , Facebook told The Verge that Myanmar 's users have historically shown lower levels of content violation reporting than other countries , leading the company to invest in proactive detection technology , including "" hate speech classifiers , "" which are now fully operational in the language of Myanmar . In the third quarter of 2018 , this technology identified 63 percent of approximately 64,000 pieces of content in Myanmar which were removed for violating hate speech policies ; in the fourth quarter of 2018 , 68 percent of 57,000 pieces of hate speech were proactively identified and removed . Facebook 's transparency page reports that the Myanmar government made five requests for user data since 2013 , but Facebook did not provide any data in those cases . <p> Another concern raised by some Kachin is the extent to which Facebook 's Myanmar-focused team represents the country 's diverse minorities . Facebook 's decision to ban the pages of four ethnic armed groups , including the Kachin Independence Army , and all related praise , support , and representation in February 2019 still holds , despite local outcry . Facebook 's representative told The Verge the company has made major efforts to ensure a positive experience for ethnic minorities from Myanmar , and ensure a two-way dialogue on these issues . <p> As part of those efforts , Facebook has held a series of eight workshops across the country in recent months , including one in Kachin on January 18th -- but local experience of the workshop was not entirely positive . Kachin workshop attendee Naw Htoi told The Verge that the workshop 's facilitators deferred detailed questions about the Jinghpaw incident , and he left feeling that "" Facebook started investing in Jinghpaw language to exert more control and watch over us . "" <p> Saijai Liangpunsakul , social impact director at Phandeeyar , a Yangon-based organization focused on using technology for social change , said that work remains to strengthen trust and bridge gaps between civil society and Facebook . "" Facebook should n't see civil society on the other side of the table ... Facebook is putting in all these resources , but the problem is we need to find ways to meaningfully work together . "" <p> "" Social media brought opportunities and hope , but it also brought harm to the country , "" she continued . "" Myanmar had been isolated for many years . People were excited about having access to information and being connected to the rest of the world ... Looking back , there was a big change , and as a country , Myanmar was n't really prepared for the harm and opportunities that would come with it . """

However , each of those systems have certain undeniable flaws . <p> And artificial intelligence is a popular thing about which to irrationally panic , thanks to half a century of warnings about the robopocalypse . <p> "" Spotify took the one unassailable element of my identity and shredded it .

After all , Earth 's got plenty of different intelligences upon it , from crows to elephants to dolphins to the octopi that will take over the planet the second they learn how to work together . I thought AI would be just another in our planet 's rich tapestry of smarts . It 'd be really good at certain things and not at others -- which is already the case , since my phone is orders of magnitude more punctual than I am . <p> But it turns out that the machines were just lulling us into a false sense of security , playing on our unwarranted confidence before hitting us in the one area in which we foolishly thought we were safe . <p> To put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playlist feature . <p> Ever since I was a child sneering at my primary school chums for not being familiar with Scritti Politti 's pre-major label output , I have clung tenaciously to my expansive and voluminous knowledge of music as a way to make up for my shortcomings in pretty much every other area of human endeavour . <p> While smarter people digitised their libraries , chucked their plastic away and got on with their lives , I lugged carton after carton of vinyl and CDs through multiple house moves , painstakingly alphabetising them by artist and chronology and lying awake at night pondering such vital questions as "" Do I mix the Elvis Costello CDs with the Elvis Costello &amp; the Attractions ones ? "" ( answer : no , obviously ) . <p> Furthermore , I learned how to read people 's record collections and make snap judgments about the sort of person they were . A single shoebox of soundtracks and compilations ? Probably not going to get along . First pressing Go Betweens vinyl ? We should talk . Elvis Costello and Elvis Costello &amp; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of monster . <p> As digital music arrived I embraced it wholeheartedly , innocently building a walking-around Spotify playlist containing a scant 2000-odd of my particular favourite songs . How I would smugly congratulate myself on its variety and breadth , playfully crossing genres and eras while showcasing the sort of deep aesthetic judgment and wisdom that only comes with decades of assiduous study . <p> Or , as it turns out , a computer algorithm . <p> In a moment of idle curiosity I clicked on Spotify 's Discover Weekly playlist . And it was with a slow-building sense of horror that I looked at the 30 songs it had chosen for me and realised that the machine had either stolen my thoughts as I slept or -- more accurately -- I was n't quite the special precious snowflake I 'd hitherto assumed . <p> Some were predictable from my playlists -- PJ Harvey , Bowie , Pavement -- but were tracks that were n't among those I 'd listened . Yet they were terrifyingly perfect . <p> Worse were the bands I had never listened to on Spotify -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cry , never listened to at all -- which were all excellent choices that I 'd never have selected on my own . <p> When was the last time I put on Canadian indie stars the Dears , much less cod-operatic synth weirdos Sparks ? Jawbox and Fugazi deep cuts ? Screamin ' Jay Hawkins ? Joe freakin ' Jackson ? Why do I not listen to Joe Jackson more often ? What have I been doing with my life ? Who even am I ? <p> And then I realised : this is how the machines will get us . Not by force , not by robotic seduction , but by taking the one thing we think we do better than anyone else and effortlessly destroying us at it . Spotify took the one unassailable element of my identity and shredded it cleanly in a few lines of code and a well-chosen Sonic Youth album track . <p> So if you need me , I 'll be picking up the shattered shards of my former sense of self , accompanied by Joe Jackson 's Look Sharp . <h> 15 comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they make up their own God .

"<h> Creating a high-performance , humane workforce for the future <p> Vlatka Hlupic , award-winning thought leader and keynote speaker for Relocate 's Think Women event explores how our attitudes and behaviours at work can have a bigger impact than you realise . <p> Marianne Curphey <p> 13 February 2020 <p> Making simple changes to the way you talk and act in your job can make a significant difference to the success of your team -- and your company . The ripples you create with your positive behaviour will have an inspirational and energising effect on your work colleagues.That 's the message from Professor Vlatka Hlupic , international award-winning thought leader , author and our keynote speaker for the Think Women workshop and lunch on Friday 6 March . At our celebration of International Women 's Day ( IWD ) , she will be talking about ' Creating positive ripples : the few affect the whole ' and how organisations can survive the huge technological changes that are taking place by adopting a new approach to management and valuing the contributions of each of their employees . <h> Relocate 's Think Women lunch will be held on 6 March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the celebrations for International Women 's Day . Hear from , and network with , inspiring women and men . Support women and girls to progress in international careers . <p> Leading academic and inspirational speaker , Professor Hlupic argues that we are all part of the process of change and those companies that do n't make the switch from the old "" command and control "" management models to a business that is more collaborative and inclusive , will fail to thrive in the future . "" The majority of organisations are still using leadership approaches from the first Industrial Revolution , "" she explains . "" Back then , management was about dominance , standardisation and command and control . It worked well for its time , when efficiency and productivity were key . However , it is very detrimental for work in the Fourth Industrial Revolution , where we are focusing more on social and environmental responsibility , and where people and organisations seek to be more purposeful . "" <h> The big shift starts with you <p> As defined by the World Economic Forum , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we live , work and relate to one another . It is a new chapter in human development , enabled by extraordinary technology advances commensurate with those of the first , second and third industrial revolutions.In this brave new world , technology and artificial intelligence will revolutionise the workplace and change many traditional roles . In this new era , different skills will be needed -- communication , collaboration , innovation and purposeful engagement . Organisations that fail to adapt will be unable to sustain their business models long term.The change starts with individuals , Professor Hlupic says . "" People need to recognise their own power , "" she says , citing the example of Celine Schillinger , founder of We Need Social and former Sanofi Pasteur global quality head of innovation and engagement . "" A big shift can begin with one person . Ms Schillinger saw all around that there were white men in power and sent an email to the executive team asking them about diversity . It started a whole social movement . She now has 300,000 followers and has created a new job for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the past , women may have held back from applying for senior management positions or accepting international assignment roles . The ripple effect would see more women moving towards executive roles and becoming role models for others.Professor Hlupic 's work helps leaders and organisations worldwide to shift to a higher level of performance and profit , while creating more engaging , purposeful and happier workplaces that do well by doing good . <h> A mindset shift in the workplace <p> While the changes start with individuals , the companies they work for also need to change in order to survive . Professor Hlupic has studied hundreds of different organisations and interviewed C-suite members to identify what makes a successful business.She has observed that in business , there are five different levels of engagement among employees and workers . "" We need Level 4 management , leadership and culture in order to make a difference , "" she says . "" There are five levels and to achieve them you need a shift in management and culture at each level . This involves new language , thinking patterns and culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apathetic and ruled by fear and blame <p> Level 2 -- employees do the minimum they can get away with each day <p> Level 3 -- people are told what to do and are micro-managed . An estimated 85 per cent of companies are operating at Level 3 , Prof Hlupic says . <p> "" Level 3 has problems with engagement , performance , innovation and profitability , "" she explains . "" In this new world , it is not a sustainable way to do business . In order to move from Level 3 to Level 4 requires a big shift of mindset . "" Level 4 is an organisation where people are enthusiastic , the culture is collaborative and where there 's trust , transparency and social and environmental responsibility . "" It yields an increase in performance , engagement , innovation and profitability . "" Level 5 is "" a limitless mindset "" and can be found at X Development ( formerly Google X ) the semi-secret research lab that created driverless cars , Google Glass , high-altitude Wi-Fi balloons and glucose-monitoring contact lenses.In her best-selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case studies across four different sectors and identifies start companies in each sector : <p> Public : Innovation Norway , a government organisation supporting entrepreneurs and the City of Glasgow College <p> Private : Salesforce.com , an American cloud-based software company headquartered in San Francisco ; Morningstar , the global financial services firm headquartered in Chicago , Illinois , United States ; and Unilever <p> SME : La Fosse associates , a technology executive recruitment <p> Not for profit : Buurtzorg Nederland , a Dutch home-care organisation , which has attracted international attention for its innovative use of independent nurse teams . <h> The importance of collaborative leadership <p> A key characteristic of organisations that enjoy a Level 4 mindset is that they have a leader who recognises the importance of getting the best out of staff . There is a focus on purpose , values , wellbeing and personal development . "" It is all about moving away from the hierarchy , "" says Professor Hlupic . "" These progressive organisations distribute decision making on the basis of knowledge and skill , not formal job titles , they allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas and they tolerate mistakes and failure . That is the only way to foster innovation . "" In a Level 4 organisation , people share ideas , celebrate and praise success , and there is a decentralisation of decision-making . The purpose of the company is aligned with individual purpose . <h> Why gender balance matters <p> "" We know that many companies are not gender-balanced , "" Professor Hlupic says . "" While it may be equal at the recruitment stage , at the higher levels of management women are under-represented . Even with targets , the representation is 20 or 30 per cent at best and progress is slow . "" Yet 60 per cent of graduates in the UK are female . "" We have a well-educated female population and 80 per cent of purchasing decisions are made by women , "" she says . "" The customer base is female , but companies are mostly run by men . The discrepancy does not make economic sense . "" The ripple effect is , therefore , something that women at work can use subtly to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better . "" With our brains , we pick up the moods and emotions of people around us . If we create positive ripples , that grows . The better it is , the better it gets . "" These small changes can help move your team towards a Level 4 mindset , make your organisation a better place to work . Prof Hlupic says , "" As more organisations become Level 4 , the whole of society will start to shift . "" Join us at Think Women on 6 May at the IoD in London to hear more inspiring stories from women in international careers , juggling family responsibilities , starting out or changing direction . Discover how you can make a difference in your organisation , community or to your own career progression . <p> So how can we begin this peaceful workplace revolution ? The first steps are to start using the language of Level 4 organisations -- a language that is positive , inclusive and working towards a common purpose . "" As an individual , you need to be at Level 3 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , "" she explains . "" At Level 3 , people talk about I , me , mine , whereas at Level four the language is we , us , team . "" The next stage is to involve your team in tasks that require collaboration , thus creating conditions for people to interact and spark ideas off each other . And it is not just women who can benefit from this shift in mindset . "" The ripple effect works for all genders . If women are surrounded by colleagues who have Level 4 thinking , this can benefit them . Plus , we need more Level 4 women at the top of organisations . "" Finally , a company needs to create a culture where staff trust their leaders . "" Trust makes a big difference to an organisation . Trust and transparency make the glue that binds Level 4 teams together , but it is not always easy to create that type of culture . "" <h> How the ripple effect can help recruitment and retention <p> A lot of companies are bogged down by complacency and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shift starts to happen , it can gather momentum . "" People get a flavour of how much better it is to work at Level 4 and how you get more done with less effort , "" Professor Hlupic explains . It is not a quick fix , though and people have to be ready for change because it is not easy . "" When we face change we see it as a threat in our brain , causing stress and anxiety at the fear of losing status or the privileges that we have . "" Making the changes can create a much more attractive workplace , which in turn means it will be easier to recruit new staff.If a company can change , it can attract new workers and retain its existing staff . In a global economy that is suffering from a skills shortage , this is a distinct competitive edge . "" People can even come back and work for a lower salary if the company fits with their values , "" she says . That explains the appeal of start-ups , particularly among Millennial workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Level 5 . "" They have big ideas and they are not afraid to experiment . "" Larger organisations are more like super-tankers . They are more difficult to change . When I work with organisations , I help leaders to change one department at a time . It takes six to nine months to see a shift .

"<h> Related <p> Electric-scooter maker Ather , artificial intelligence-driven health tech firm Sigtuple and biotech startup Pandorum are three examples of Flipkart founders Sachin and Binny Bansal 's investments in startups unrelated to the venture that started by selling books online and was sold last week to retail giant Walmart , valuing the Bengaluru-based firm just shy of $21 billion . <p> These investments might help Sachin and Binny surf through the next wave of entrepreneurship in India . And this wave , experts say , will be fuelled by bold business ideas that look beyond the ecommerce market as we know it -- and away from the moats heavy-hitter investors are building around areas such as cab aggregation , hospitality and fashion . The entrepreneurship buzz will now be around emerging areas of homegrown brands , business-to-business ( B2B ) ventures and companies with specialised vertical focus . Experts point to juice brand Raw Pressery , ready-to-cook brand ID , seller of branded tea Chai Point and B2B platform Udaan as some examples . Healthcare , education and fashion would also gain . <p> Watershed MomentThe handsome returns from the sale of Flipkart , which was set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit up the market . "" This is a watershed moment for startups in India , "" Binny Bansal , executive chairman and group CEO of the firm , said a day after the $16 billion deal was announced . The Flipkart-Walmart combine and Amazon have , according to industry estimates , 80% of India 's ecommerce market . This fact has made industry watchers realise a duel in ecommerce , however lucrative the idea , may be a losing proposition . "" If you pitch another ecommerce idea to investors , you might be laughed out of the room , "" says Bala Parthasarathy , founder of MoneyTap , a consumer lending platform . As funding revives and new segments become viable , it then seems like a natural progression that entrepreneurs are now looking beyond ecommerce . <p> The common wisdom now is that with Amazon and Flipkart dominating the ecommerce space and Alibabafuelled Paytm also in the market , investor interest is shifting to ideas away from this area . "" The time for horizontal ecommerce is done , "" says Samir Kumar , managing director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "" Entrepreneurs need to target newer opportunities in segments around IoT , machine learning and consumer brands , and we 're seeing growing interest in verticals like healthcare and education . "" He points to ventures he 's backed that are barely a couple of years old , like Tricog and Movensync , as examples of this shift in entrepreneurial interest . <p> Take Parthasarathy 's case . The Silicon Valley entrepreneur and a former venture capitalist with Prime Ventures returned to India to work with the Aadhaar programme . He saw immense scope in financial technology , or fintech , and has made it his next calling . The Walmart-Flipkart deal , entrepreneurs like him say , show some segments may have matured , leaving little room for innovation . On the other hand , Parthasarathy says , app-based consumer lending is a vastly underserved market , with financial services and fintech companies struggling to comprehend the needs of consumers here . He claims that barely 2% of the country has access to consumer lending . MoneyTap wants to tap this space by using technology allows users to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied up with two banks and disbursed loans of around 500 crore in 2018 , Parthasarathy says this will top 2,000 crore by July next year . Unlike traditional finance companies , which struggle with poor returns on loans , he hopes the extensive use of technology ( by using credit scores and other metrics ) will keep MoneyTap 's default rates low . <p> However , experts say , a loser in mega deals like Walmart-Flipkart is the make in India drive . "" The ideal situation would have been domestic startups taking advantage of local market opportunities . But with the Indian government asleep at the wheel , foreign companies will now dominate , "" says Vivek Wadhwa , a distinguished fellow at Harvard Law School 's Labor and Worklife Program . "" The Walmart deal will intensify competition . The elephants will battle each and this will , in the short term , benefit Indian consumers . However , Indian startups will be trampled in the melee . "" <p> SoftBank Group , including the Soft-Bank Vision Fund , has invested over $8 billion in India since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . This has dwarfed the investments of Tiger Global ( $3.63 billion ) and Naspers ( $2.9 billion ) , according to Tracxn , a provider of investment data . Investments of traditional marquee venture capital funds are even smaller . <p> The big bucks from Walmart ( and Amazon and Softbank ) will cause more harm than good , say market watchers . With India being the next big opportunity for many companies -- within and outside the technology industry -- these behemoths will look to swamp the market with their money and corner lucrative pieces of various segments . New innovation already seems unlikely in cab sharing . Travel is being dominated by Makemytrip and Oyo , with Softbank 's growing influence as an investor in the latter already causing disquiet among entrepreneurs . <p> Growth Story , the startup factory of serial entrepreneur and investor K Ganesh , has already started focusing on the next generation of opportunities . Ganesh , who has backed startups such as online grocer BigBasket and healthtech firm Portea , says two key black swan events have play a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the demonetisation of November 8 , 2016 , drove the growth of fintech ventures and , second , the launch and explosive growth of Reliance 's Jio mobile service gave these startups a booster shot . <p> At Verloop , a provider of marketing automation tools , the focus has been on using automation and machine learning to improve and hasten the speed of customer interactions online for brands such as Nykaa and for celebrities . Gaurav Singh , CEO of Verloop , points out that brands such as Nykaa are swamped by some 50,000 chat conversations daily and social media channels of celebrities also struggle to deal with the volume of conversations coming their way . Verloop manages conversations in seven languages and helps these companies and individuals monetise online assets better . <p> For entrepreneurs like Singh , running a young enterprise can be a challenge , especially after the Walmart deal , where a stellar exit has given investors fresh confidence in their India investments . Verloop , for one , is not taking any chances . It has made revenues from day one of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily using internal accruals to fund itself . "" From a decade of focusing on discounts and ( app ) downloads , conversations are now focused on product market fit and bottom line , "" Singh says , adding that his firm does n't need to deal with VC money for growth , at least not for now . Instead , he has raised funds from Ganesh 's Growth Story , where he and a bunch of other fledgeling ventures share a roomy office in Bengaluru 's Domlur suburb . <p> The focus for many internet-based ventures has been on apps . But Singh is betting on a post-app world , where consumers deal with brands and stars on chat , driven by cheaper data plans . <p> Despite Singh 's reluctance to use venture capital money , startups are seeing a resurgence in investor interest . Much of 2016 and 2o17 had seen an acute investment withdrawal , as VCs and other risk capital investors turned the taps off due to a series of failed investments and poor returns . <p> As many of these ventures have run aground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think a turnaround is around the corner . "" India is seeing renewed interest from limited partners and the establishment of a range of new early-stage funds is a sign of this , "" says Suresh Shanmugham , managing director , Saama Capital , an early stage investor that recently raised $100 million for its latest India fund . <p> This renewed interest , coinciding with the sale of Flipkart , means a flush for early stage investments . While global marquees names such as Sequoia , Accel and Matrix have all raised India funds , a widening pool of limited partner interest has helped new domestic funds also set up shop . "" There has been a massive increase in the availability of mentors and early-stage backers for entrepreneurs , "" says Kumar of Inventus , "" Some of these are like the Bansals of Flipkart and Vijay ( Shekhar Sharma , the CEO and founder of Paytm ) , who 've seen one cycle of entrepreneurship and want to back the next round . "" <p> And with Sachin Bansal a billionaire now , the jostle to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former senior employees such as Mekin Maheshwari , Punit Soni and Amit Malviya are active angel investors . <p> One venture that has benefitted from the collective wisdom of Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal is Bengaluru-based Sigtuple , a healthcare technology provider that uses artificial intelligence to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnostic tests . The firm , backed by Accel Partners , was initially funded by the Flipkart founders and others . Sigtuple 's CEO Rohit Kumar Pandey says Sachin Bansal was very clear that he did n't understand healthcare , but ws a technology enthusiast and was interested whar technology could do , be it healthcare or any other segment . "" He believed that data-driven intelligence was the way to go , be it healthcare , ecommerce or manufacturing . He believed that a pair of fresh eyes can make a difference . "" Sigtuple has been able to grow from being just a pilot project to finalising plans for a global business . <p> The Flipkart sale has understandably made startups funded by the platform 's cofounders bullish . Founders across consumer ventures , B2B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pivotal moment for India 's startup movement . "" India will see the growth of a number of large homegrown consumer brands , "" says Amuleek Singh , CEO of Chai Point . The firm has 100 stores across the country and expects to have 400 to 500 more in four or five years . Unlike other chains , Singh does n't see in-store purchases as the only source of revenue . Tea dispensers account for 40% of the company 's top line , followed by 20% from delivery and the rest from retail purchases . <p> "" Tea is the beverage of choice for a vast majority of Indians ... the tea market is 30 times that of coffee , "" he adds . "" We live in an omnichannel world and anyone who believes in only one form of reach is living at least a decade in the past . "" <p> Breaking the Mould Unlike Singh 's capital-intensive idea , Vinamra Pandiya wants to build his business , Qtrove , by staying away from external investment . After exiting his last venture , Tasty Khaana , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws shifted his focus to building a curated market place for homespun products . After a pilot project covering 30-35 products from 10 to 15 sellers , he went live in 2017 . Pandiya wants to steer away from the startup herd and not repeat the mistakes of the previous generation . "" There 's no point being the 100th player in the market . You will be eaten alive . When you offer discounts , you attract transactions , not customers . "" <p> Today , Qtrove has 50,000 customers , 600-plus sellers and over 6,000 products . While he charges a 30% commission from sellers , his has stayed away from free shipping . As an antithesis to the Flipkart model , he wants lower than 50% of orders paid as cash on delivery as it is a drain on margins . <p> These entrepreneurs might head the next multibillion-dollar breakout companies from India , and they might actually do it without replicating Flipkart 's business model ."

"<p> Data analytics is the key to bringing personalisation back into the way brands engage customers in a digitally driven environment , IAG 's chief customer officer claims . <p> Speaking at the Chief Analytics Officer Forum in Sydney , the insurance group 's Julie Batch said the insurance giant is working to build out a highly granular , longitudinal view of customers using first-party data assets in order to not only understand them , but deliver a better experience . <p> "" Gaining a longitudinal view of each customer is about taking all data assets , assembling these in one place , so teams can understand the operational , transactional and sentiment pieces of information that give us a rich tapestry of engaging with customers today , "" Batch told attendees . <p> "" These first-party data sets are unique to us . Each one of us has a huge history of how customers have interacted with our organisations . You often hear people working from their online asset or utilising third-party data assets to understand customers . While that 's of huge value , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in assembling it , there are lots of people putting that together and selling that to different providers to achieve the same thing , which is customer reach . <p> "" We all have an ability to access our first-party data sets . The problem is they 're hard to get to . "" <p> Batch noted IAG has 144 different systems of data and 18 production systems . "" What we have done is worked from our first-party data assets out , in assembling information and putting it together . It was clunky and hard , but we 're now in a position where we take that data and connect it to online assets and provide a whole different level of understanding of our customers . <p> "" What 's also critical is taking algorithms to generate insights from those assets , and then get them from the lab to the factory really fast . "" <p> As part of its push to become customer-led and more responsive , IAG recently reorganised its operations . The new-look business has two customer-facing divisions covering sales , service , and brand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divisions covering customer experience , technology and operations then support IAG 's strategy . These include the Customer Lab , which Batch heads up , which is responsible for customer experience strategy and driving product innovation through data and insights , brand architecture and new business incubations and venturing . <p> "" What we 're trying to optimise the marketing experience , but also the end-to-end experience , whether it 's the brand we present to customers , how we communicate with them before or after they become a customer , how we direct them to the right channels , how we sell and price our products and importantly , how we service them across the entire lifecycle , "" she said . "" That all comes back to our ability to identify and understand them . "" <p> Batch said the first step for the Customer Lab was to combine customer attributes , such as how many products and types an individual holds with the group . <p> "" We visualise every customer that meets that condition of interest , including those that have departed the organisation , and analyse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another organisation , "" she explained . <p> "" We study that so we can extract correlations that drive business insight . We then work with our customer experience teams and innovate new experiences to try and change how customers engage with this . "" <p> IAG has also employed machine learning algorithms to understand the impact of deploying new products and offerings in market , allowing teams to test a massive number of opportunities at any one time , Batch said . <p> "" We feed that back into longitudinal view and know what we can do better to engage , "" she said . <p> Supporting these efforts are sophisticated systems of measurement systems , along with optimisation tools , she continued . A final key in using data for business differentiator is the ability to conduct experiments in market in real time to drive better outcomes that teams can pivot and learn from , Batch said . <p> As an example of IAG 's data analytics activities in action , Batch pointed to customer-based portfolio management . Taken by product , IAG found four segments it could study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and those that love the brand and are future potentials . <p> "" We grabbed 12 customers from each segment to understand and analyse what 's happening with each so we can design an experience around them , "" Batch said . "" What we found was we were losing customers that were extremely valuable to us and who held tens of thousands of dollars in policies . We 'd lose that entire customer and value set on the back of one ill-informed offering or policy that did n't consider the customer as a whole or in context of lifetime value . <p> "" Through data , we were able to look at those customer renewals with significant policy holdings , and redesigned the way we engage with them in order to engage on lifetime value . "" <p> A second example of data in action was in optimising the claims experience during the recent Sydney storms to process a whopping 18,000 claims received in two days . To do this , IAG created a randomised control group of about 1000 people , managed using their normal processes and practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers and treated each one of these slightly differently to see which generated the best customer and business outcomes . This included a group where IAG tried to settle claims immediately , or pushed to different operators . Batch said it then measured and tested responses to all of these . <p> The end result was that people who received an optimal approach and had their claims closed quickly and without debate were not only more efficient in terms of management , but also all renewed their policies and more rapidly than before . <p> "" We normally have a 90-92 per cent renewal rate ... this showed real business uplift and real speed and delivery of when to optimise the experience through data and analytics , "" Batch said . <h> Blog Posts <p> Facebook 's Oculus Rift has finally launched . The highly anticipated product rollout has come with such a massive amount of buzz and hype that it 's difficult not to get pumped , even though there is such a backlog of orders for the device that it 's hard to call it an actual launch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is hard to precisely predict what marketing will look like in five years ' time.What we do know is that it 's going to be even more personalised , integrated , data-driven and mobile than today -- and that is before you factor in the impact of augmented reality , virtual reality and the Internet of Things , which some of the large global marketers are already beginning to toy around with . <p> Is anyone doing content marketing the right way ?

Certain U.S. states and hospitals are so eager for the Ottawa firm&amp;rsquo ; s COVID-19 testing technology they are offering to buy Spartan&amp;rsquo ; s entire future production . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As a businessman , company founder and CEO Paul Lem is tempted . As a Canadian , he is concerned . &amp;ldquo ; We want to serve our country , &amp;rdquo ; he says , &amp;ldquo ; I know the ( Canadian ) government is really working hard on this , but we need purchase orders now . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; These could come any hour , such is the speed at which things are moving . Spartan is one of those rare companies that happens to be in the right place at the right time . The company has spent 14 years developing portable DNA testing technology now being directed at the war against the COVID-19 virus . Unlike most other COVID-19 test kits , Spartan&amp;rsquo ; s offers results in less than 45 minutes because the data doesn&amp;rsquo ; t need to be processed by a laboratory . It can be done onsite. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src= "" https : **34;3119;TOOLONG ... title= "" Paul Lem , CEO of Spartan Bioscience Inc. in Ottawa . "" alt= "" Paul Lem , CEO of Spartan Bioscience Inc. in Ottawa . "" data-portal-copyright= "" Julie Oliver "" **28;3155;TOOLONG "" 1 "" data-license-id= "" 1588696 "" /&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Spartan test kits aren&amp;rsquo ; t quite ready for prime time . The company still has to establish if its product can produce accurate results using the particular chemical ingredients specified by the U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) . This could take a few more days , maybe weeks . Nevertheless , a significant purchase order would allow Spartan to gear up production of its test kits to be ready as soon as possible . The company has enough material on hand to produce more than 15,000 test kits but requires significant investment to be able to supply the hundreds of thousands of tests that will be necessary . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The fact that Spartan isn&amp;rsquo ; t already producing says much about the frustratingly slow rollout of COVID-19 testing across North America . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Like other commercial firms and government labs , Spartan relied on the CDC to develop a diagnostic panel of reagents ( chemical compounds ) used to detect the COVID-19 virus . It proved a fateful chokepoint because CDC ran into manufacturing problems that would not be resolved until late February . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; At that point , dozens of firms and labs began furiously developing COVID-19 test kits based on the CDC recipe . Roche Diagnostics , which had been developing a test for the virus since its California unit began monitoring its spread in China in late December , was among the first to receive regulatory approval , along with Thermo Fisher Scientific . That was on March 13 . The formal okay for employing the test kits was granted March 18 . Both approvals were done on a temporary , emergency use basis . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Not coincidentally , the Canadian branches of these firms were authorized on a similar basis to begin testing here by Health Minister Patty Hajdu . On March 20 , Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government has signed a letter of intent with Spartan to buy COVID-19 test kits . Cephied , a California rival that also produces portable test kits , won approval around the same time . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The significance of these and similar announcements is twofold . First , it shows the massive potential for expediting the supply of test kits and other essential products . Second , the fact that such a surge is necessary demonstrates how much the battle against COVID-19 has changed &amp;mdash ; from isolating and containing the virus , to massively testing for its presence . The number of new cases is growing so fast , we are now well behind the testing curve .

Thermo Fisher Scientific is ramping up even more quickly . The Boston-based company had 1.5 million test kits available last week and &amp;nbsp ; expects quickly to manufacture two million per week and , sometime in April , scale to five million tests weekly . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Just what percentage of this increased production will make its way to Canada is a little unclear . Roche did not return calls and Thermo Fisher Scientific said its 1,500 initially available tests will be distributed to about 200 labs in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Allocation will take place based on need , &amp;rdquo ; says company spokesman Ron O&amp;rsquo ; Brien , in reference to subsequent production .

Medical personnel can&amp;rsquo ; t afford to self-isolate for two weeks merely under the suspicion of having contracted the virus . Tests are also needed to keep at home those who are carriers but showing no symptoms . And authorities need to understand more who is most susceptible to COVID-19 and why . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Equally important , for sheer peace of mind , Canadians want to be able to quickly rule out flu and other illnesses they may be experiencing . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; For the moment , however , there&amp;rsquo ; s a test kit shortage , which means Ottawa residents must meet a stringent series of criteria ( contact with a known COVID-19 case for instance ) &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; present with specific symptoms ( fever , difficulty breathing ) before medical personnel will administer a test for COVID-19 . Not only that , the testing operation at the Brewer Park Arena is still taking a week or more to deliver test results , which must be processed through one of the government labs . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Little wonder that Paul Lem and his colleagues at Spartan Bioscience are so anxious to get on with the job of meeting this desperate need . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;nbsp ; &lt;/p&gt; James BagnallTue , 24 Mar 2020 21:52:29 **45;3423;TOOLONG ...

It&amp;rsquo ; s a sector that relies heavily on buyers with secure jobs , direct personal contact and confidence in the future . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Yet , despite all the pernicious effects of social distancing , including lost jobs , shrinking wages and disappearing revenues in core parts of the economy , the past week has been anything but quiet . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; In the last seven days , we&amp;rsquo ; ve seen 576 new listings , 119 of them in the past 24 hours , &amp;rdquo ; says Bill Meyer , owner of HomeTeamOttawa , a real estate firm that markets services under the Remax Hallmark Realty banner . &amp;nbsp ; &amp;ldquo ; We are still in this period of pent up demand . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Indeed , the COVID-19 virus smacked into Ottawa&amp;rsquo ; s real estate industry just as it was scaling rarely seen peaks . Residential resale prices had soared 20 per cent year over year in January and February , the highest such gains in nearly four decades . Residential properties last month sold for a record average $564,000 , while condos fetched nearly $350,000. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Even so , momentum will carry the sector only so far . A reckoning is coming and there&amp;rsquo ; s a whiff of desperation in the air . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We aren&amp;rsquo ; t doing open houses anymore , &amp;rdquo ; Meyer says , &amp;ldquo ; but this market is strong because some people still have to sell .

The firm&amp;rsquo ; s 15 agents and staff are working out of their homes . Meyers goes to the office for a couple of hours each morning and evening , when he is the only one there , and catches up with colleagues by phone or email . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Like many other real estate firms , Meyer&amp;rsquo ; s company has stringent protocols in place . Agents still arrange showings , but there can be no overlap of potential buyers . Hand sanitizers or wipes must be available , and all inside doors must be kept open so no one has to touch surfaces . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meyer on Tuesday arranged an estate sale in which all papers were signed electronically . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It&amp;rsquo ; s a similar scene at Paul Rushforth Real Estate , an agency with 13 realtors. &amp;ldquo ; We&amp;rsquo ; ve closed our offices , but our front desk is still taking queries from home , &amp;rdquo ; Rushforth says . &amp;ldquo ; We&amp;rsquo ; re not doing open houses , and showings ( of houses ) are just one person at a time . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rushforth says he has been surprised by the briskness of sales activity this past week , but can see underlying weakness . As with Meyer , many of his company&amp;rsquo ; s new listings are from people who absolutely need the cash after buying another house earlier and fully expecting to pay for it by selling their existing home into a hot market . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; So far prices are holding up , but Rushforth notes some telling patterns . &amp;ldquo ; We&amp;rsquo ; re still seeing bidding wars for properties , &amp;rdquo ; he says , &amp;ldquo ; including more than half our ten most recent deals . &amp;rdquo ; But he notes that a property that might have attracted 10 bids early in March now gets just two or three . This , in turn , means sellers are not getting as much over their initial asking price . &amp;ldquo ; This week we listed a property for $699,000 and it sold for $708,000 , &amp;rdquo ; Rushforth explains , &amp;ldquo ; Two weeks ago , it would have got $770,000. &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src= "" https : **34;3640;TOOLONG ... title= "" A home for sale on Fourth Avenue in the Glebe on Friday .

"" alt= "" Paul Lem , CEO of Spartan Bioscience , seen here several years ago with his company 's DNA analyzer , is overseeing the effort to quickly develop a COVID-19 test kit . "" data-portal-copyright= "" Julie Oliver "" **28;3930;TOOLONG "" 1 "" data-license-id= "" 893947 "" /&gt; &lt;p&gt; For most of us , the COVID-19 virus has been a malevolent force , destroying jobs , wealth and social mobility . But for some , this new epoch is also an opportunity to draw on a lifetime of work to do good . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Paul Lem , the founder and chief executive of Spartan Bioscience , for one . A few weeks ago , he and his fellow scientists pivoted abruptly from ongoing projects to focus on what seems the perfect application for one of its technology platforms &amp;mdash ; a way of quickly determining who has contracted the COVID-19 virus . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s terrible what&amp;rsquo ; s happening around the world , &amp;rdquo ; Lem said , &amp;ldquo ; and we want to do our part to help solve this crisis . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Lem said he expects within weeks to have a hand-held product capable of identifying the COVID-19 virus within 30 to 45 minutes , a speedy result made possible because the necessary analysis is done on-site . It does not have to go to a laboratory for processing , as is the case with most other DNA test technology . If the Spartan device works as expected , it would be ideal for use at border crossings , remote communities , physicians&amp;rsquo ; offices , among other venues . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; What makes him believe he can do this , let alone so quickly ? &amp;nbsp ; Only that he has spent 14 years painstakingly building DNA test kits flexible enough to make this kind of transition . His Ottawa company has developed portable test technology for detecting the DNA of bacteria that causes Legionnaire&amp;rsquo ; s Disease and also for studying the DNA in heart patients to determine whether they will reject certain blood thinners ( Plavix , among others ) because of a genetic mutation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The mechanism for the proposed COVID-19 test kit is similar to that employed by other global firms &amp;mdash ; genetic material is extracted from a cheek swab and parts of it are amplified through a polymerase chain reaction . Spartan uses a technique called realtime or qPCR , in which data is collected throughout the PCR cycle . &amp;nbsp ; The company&amp;rsquo ; s core product , Spartan Cube , serves as a portable mini-lab that offers analysis of the swab on-site . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The reason Spartan and others are able to rush forward with COVID-19 testers is the sequence of the genome is already known , along with the dozens of proteins it produces . This makes it easier for companies to develop ways of at least detecting COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The only question now is whether the Spartan Cube can process the genetic material in a manner acceptable to regulators such as the U.S. Centres for Disease Control or the Canadian Institutes of Health Research , which last month launched a research program to accelerate the development of COVID-19 tests and cures . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class= "" cat-head short "" **40;3960;TOOLONG ... &lt;ul class= "" relatedlinks "" &gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= "" https : **33;4002;TOOLONG ... assessment centres to open , but testing will focus on health workers and high-risk people : **27;4037;TOOLONG &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= "" https : **33;4066;TOOLONG ... System showing strain as requests for testing , assessment **31;4101;TOOLONG &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; This is right in our wheelhouse , &amp;rdquo ; said Lem , who has been talking with Canadian authorities . &amp;ldquo ; I don&amp;rsquo ; t see any technical challenges , &amp;rdquo ; he added . Lem said if the development of the COVID-19 test device goes well , Spartan is set to produce 9,000 test cartridges per week using its own manufacturing facility in Ottawa , with the capacity to accelerate after that . &amp;nbsp ; There&amp;rsquo ; s a catch of course &amp;mdash ; gearing up production will require more capital . Just who would provide it isn&amp;rsquo ; t clear . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The company , which employs about 70 , had been in the midst of a marketing campaign to raise fresh equity aimed at helping Spartan complete its shift from a research outfit to a commercial firm selling products that have nothing to do with COVID-19 . Raising money privately is certainly possible but can it be done quickly enough ? &amp;nbsp ; Given the government&amp;rsquo ; s recent enthusiasm for spending to combat the effect of the virus , federal money is also a possibility . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Of course , dozens of other firms are ramping up production of COVID-19 test kits and concepts . &amp;nbsp ; A prominent player is Kogen Biotech , the first South Korean firm to produce virus testing technology last month . This put it in the vanguard of an countrywide effort that led to drive-in testing centres across South Korea and the screening of more than 300,000 people for COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; According to Lem , the Kogen technology relies on final analysis being done in labs , a multi-day process . But because the testing started relatively early in the COVID-19 cycle , South Korea nevertheless managed to flatten the curve of infected people . The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Korea as of Thursday afternoon was 8,565 &amp;mdash ; up roughly six per cent so far this week , compared with a near tripling in Germany , Spain and the U.S. and more than triple in Canada ( to 761 confirmed cases ) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Kogen is now exporting its virus test kits to more than 30 countries and has reached weekly production of 10,000. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Given the size of the COVID-19 pandemic &amp;mdash ; nearly 240,000 confirmed cases worldwide and growing rapidly &amp;mdash ; there is plenty of room for multiple suppliers using different techniques . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The hope now is that most of these devices work , and can be put in the hands of the people who administer the tests , as quickly as possible . &amp;nbsp ; In the case of Spartan Bioscience , speedy and accurate tests would go some distance to helping this country flatten this alarming COVID-19 curve . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ALSO IN THE NEWS&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= "" https : **33;4134;TOOLONG ...

This move by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau was in addition to earlier announcements aimed at increasing the flexibility of banks and federal crown corporations to boost lending authority . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The upshot : for the next few months federal authorities will not bother you or your employer about taxes owing , it will forgive interest accumulating on student loans and will generally encourage you to get on with the difficult business of surviving the coming economic contraction . Where necessary , the government is making available cash to prevent the economy from seizing up . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; How bad will it get ? &amp;ldquo ; Let&amp;rsquo ; s be painfully transparent , &amp;rdquo ; the TD Bank&amp;rsquo ; s chief economist Beata Caranci , wrote earlier this week : &amp;nbsp ; &amp;ldquo ; The likelihood of hitting the point estimate on GDP growth over the next six months is remote . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Caranci recently revised her forecast for GDP growth after inflation to just 0.2 per cent for the year , down from 1.8 growth a few weeks ago . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That doesn&amp;rsquo ; t sound like much until you consider Canada has a $2.34 trillion economy , which means a percentage point drop of 1.6 translates to more than $33 billion in lost production . &amp;nbsp ; And , as we all know , the pain of COVID-19 is falling disproportionately hard on a few sectors : airlines , retailing , restaurants , hotels . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most economists agree the biggest part of the economic slide will occur in the second quarter , which starts April 1 . RBC and BMO Capital are predicting an annualized second-quarter contraction of 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent , with economic growth returning by the fourth quarter at the latest . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src= "" https : **34;4426;TOOLONG ... title= "" IKEA has closed all of their stores until further notice due to the COVID-19 outbreak .

Here&amp;rsquo ; s what the Liberals are looking at : absent COVID-19 , the government would have been able to count on $585 billion worth of national economic activity during the second quarter . But , taking a more pessimistic view of things , if the economy contracts an average of five per cent due to the knock-on effects of COVID-19 , that would represent $29 billion to $30 billion in lost production in the second quarter . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Much of this would come in the form of wages lost to shorter hours and layoffs . Other reductions would be foregone business profits . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It&amp;rsquo ; s all a question of keeping the economy liquid , which is why the Liberals have targeted their relief at individuals and companies most vulnerable to seizing up or going bust . Wednesday the government said it would introduce budget bills to get money directly into the hands of laid off workers and lower income Canadians through a variety of mechanisms , ranging from the GST tax credit to Canada Child Benefit program . Other beneficiaries will be Indigenous Canadians , homeless people and women&amp;rsquo ; s shelters . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The $27.4 billion in total direct aid tallies up roughly with the projected second-quarter economic contraction . &amp;nbsp ; And this doesn&amp;rsquo ; t include assistance from the provinces and municipalities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Will it all be enough ? &amp;nbsp ; No one knows . It&amp;rsquo ; s unlikely health authorities will have dealt a body blow to COVID-19 by the end of June . Nevertheless , there are a few rays of hope . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Consider that the growth in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China and South Korea is slowing dramatically , according to data accumulated by ncov2019.live &amp;mdash ; a website that tracks the pandemic minute by minute . &amp;nbsp ; Between March 14 and the morning of March 18 , the number of new cases in China grew by just one per cent , and in South Korea by four per cent . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Yes , we can argue about the heavy-handed tactics used by Chinese authorities and the quality of its data , but the underlying message is the destiny of the COVID-19 virus isn&amp;rsquo ; t necessarily to continue infecting humans at exponential rates . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Equally important , the global spread of COVID-19 has been matched by an energetic international scientific effort aimed at finding ways to kill or quickly test for the virus . Armed with copies of the COVID-19 genome , and knowledge of the multiple proteins it produces , dozens of teams worldwide are chasing down potential ways of dealing with it . The Economist magazine last week reported more than 300 papers had been posted on MedRXiv , a site for medical research . Three weeks ago , China&amp;rsquo ; s clinical trial registry featured more than 100 trials related to COVID-19 and related vaccines . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In Australia , the University of Queensland Centre for Clinical Research is reporting promising results in curing COVID-19 by administering a combination of drugs &amp;mdash ; chloroquine and an older HIV drug &amp;mdash ; already registered and known to be well tolerated by patients individually . Much remains to be done , however , including testing for the tolerance and efficacy of different combinations of the medicines . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nevertheless , all this activity is a reminder that we aren&amp;rsquo ; t doomed to suffer a protracted and grisly economic recession . Word of a real success in clinical terms would undo most of the fear in an instant . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In the meantime , our federal government can not afford to let the country&amp;rsquo ; s economic engine seize up , or its citizens retreat into a cave of despair . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;nbsp ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;STAY INFORMED : &lt;a href= "" http : **34;4492;TOOLONG ...

When the policy takes effect , cross-border shoppers and tourists will be turned away , as border crossings are restricted to essential workers , truckers and others who facilitate trade between the two countries . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Closing Canada&amp;rsquo ; s border with the U.S. is something the provinces have been asking for since Monday , when Canada announced that Americans would be exempt from a new policy to restrict entry by foreign nationals to slow the spread of COVID-19 . Removing the American exemption was particularly important to British Columbia , a province struggling to contain the outbreak locally amidst unwelcome tourist visits by Americans wanting to take advantage of our weakened dollar . In addition , the U.S.&amp;rsquo ; s deep mishandling of the pandemic &amp;ndash ; from inadequate testing to defiant millennials partying at bars to the large number of Canadian cases attributable to travel to the U.S. &amp;ndash ; has made Canadians realize that our shared border currently poses a major public health threat . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Since Monday&amp;rsquo ; s announcement to close Canada&amp;rsquo ; s borders to other foreign nationals , hints were offered in press conferences that Canadian and American officials were discussing closing our shared border as well . Thus , Wednesday&amp;rsquo ; s announcement was not a major surprise , and represents an important step to reduce the transmission of cases into Canada . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Still , Canadian officials were right to pursue a joint decision with the Americans to ensure bilateral trade and commerce continue .

I was reminded recently , though , that there are still a lot of people who are unaware of the app and how easy it can make life when you are constantly taking photos of your kids and have limited space on your phone . <p> Every year on Easter Sunday , someone on my wife Sanci 's side of the family hosts a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , and as usual this year , everyone was taking photos of all the children hunting eggs and playing holiday games . Of course , there were also the inevitable photos taken of the entire family on the front porch . <p> All of us iPhone users were Airdropping our photos to each other , and everyone was texting them back and forth . The next day while I was at work , Shonda , the wife of Sanci 's cousin who lives in Winchester , was telling me she was missing a few that she wanted . After I texted her a few more , I noticed that my Google Photos app had created a photo collage of my daughter , Eliza , and her daughter of the same age playing together at holiday gatherings over the last four years or so , so I sent that as well . <p> This is the type of thing the AI ( artificial intelligence ) in Google Photos does all the time without even having to be prompted . I explained to her that the AI uses ( extremely accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearing in the same photos together and can put together collages or slideshows all on its own . I 'm pretty sure it notices when the photos are taken months apart , so I think it assumes these were taken on special occasions . This feature also makes it great for sorting photos of friends or if you 're looking for pictures of your kids spending time with a particular grandparent or other relative . <p> Shonda told me she did n't know anything about Google Photos , so I texted her more information about it , and before I knew it , the text was way too long ( as is this column , I will also admit ) . It made me realize that if I was going to be a Google Photos evangelist , it was probably time to write my own column about it . <p> Like almost everyone else out there , I stopped taking photos with film around 15 years ago . I now have thousands of photos in my possession , and the rate at which I take them has obviously increased exponentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never get rid of any photos I take because you never know when you 're going to need them again . Sometimes we 'll be working on a story for the Ledger and I will realize that a photo I took years ago of an important event will be perfect to use , so I need to know exactly where to find it immediately . <p> For a very long time , I saved work photos by burning them onto DVDs ( our current office computers do n't even have disc drives anymore ) and saved personal photos on my laptop . I kept this up until just a few months ago when I realized I was about six months behind in downloading the photos from my phone . By this time , I had at least 1,000 photos and videos . This was last August right after my second daughter , Louisa , was born , so my wife 's best friend , Nickea , was in town from Portland , Oregon to meet the baby and help us around the house for a few days . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto my laptop , she thought I was nuts . She always accessed her old photos off iCloud , so she asked why I felt the need to save the images to a hard drive , especially since I knew my 9-year-old laptop was bound to crash sooner or later . Even with most of the photos backed up on an external hard drive , this seemed like a big waste of time to her . <p> "" I do n't know , I 've just always done it this way , "" I said . <p> Of course , even then , I knew this was a weak response and I was already aware that my method for saving photos was not only stupid and unsustainable , but also extremely inconvenient . Since Parker had sworn by Google Photos so many times , I thought I would give it a try . <p> There is a paid version where you can save photos in their full resolution , but the free version is unlimited and does n't reduce the size of photos to a noticeable degree , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There might come a day when I regret not having saved all my home videos in full high definition , but for right now , I am satisfied just being able to find everything easily and knowing I can -- in theory , at least -- access it forever . <p> If you have a Gmail account , you already have a Google Photos account by default , so all you have to do is click on the tab on the Google home page to start using it . You can then start uploading everything you want from your computer . You 'll also want to download the mobile app so that it will effortlessly back up every new photo and video you take . <p> It was n't long before I was hooked , so I went all in on it . It took me two or three weeks to upload everything from my laptop -- including scanned copies of old childhood photos by mom gave me on a USB drive -- but now every photo and video in my library is grouped chronologically from earliest to most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best things about using Google Photos if you are a parent is that you and your spouse can seamlessly share the photos and videos you have taken separately . So now I do n't have to make sure to archive Sanci 's photos for posterity and she does n't have to text me everything she wants me to see if she does n't feel like it . Plus , it 's a nice treat when I get an alert on my phone that says she added new photos to the library and I can look at photos of the kids that she might have taken when I was was n't there with them . <p> The big added bonus with that feature is that putting together the calendars we give our parents for Christmas every year has become so much easier now . Sanci used to have to look through the files on my slow laptop , which works great for its age but does n't even have a working battery and does n't connect to wi-fi anymore . <p> As I mentioned before , the AI puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and videos together with music behind it . Sometimes it does n't amount to much and you can safely ignore it , but other times , it comes up with something really neat that you will want to save forever . Apple does its own version of this in the iPhone photos app , but that 's not as easy to hang onto if you see a creation you really like . <p> I would n't go back to not using the service for anything . Although I have always been an iPhone user and do n't expect that to change , it 's nice to know I do n't have to be tied to Apple 's ecosystem for the rest of my life if I do n't want to since the app is available in both the App Store and in Android 's Google Play store . <p> The one problem I 've had in the last few months is that the app inexplicably stopped backing up my videos . It 's probably just an issue with settings , so I have no doubt I will eventually figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ download videos from iCloud and upload them to the Google library using my internet browser."

"<h> First Distribution ramps up Digital Security and IoT <p> First Distribution has expanded its distribution offering with a new division focusing on Digital Security and Internet of Things ( IoT ) . <p> David Simpson appointed as General Manager heads up the new division specialising in digital security and video surveillance solutions . <p> Tony Abrahall , Director of First Distribution , explains that the new division complements the existing datacentre , cloud , cybersecurity and networks business units within First Distribution and moves the distributor further up the value chain . <p> "" The convergence of security networks and IP networks allows us to provide a complete turnkey offering to the market , something that no other distributor currently offers , "" he says . <p> Simpson is no stranger to the security industry and has been a systems integrator ( SI ) for most of his career . <p> Having seen the convergence of traditional security with IT and networking , he identified a gap in the market for integrated products and expertise . <p> "" As an a Systems Integrator I battled to find partners with the right level of knowledge and technical support to help us to deploy complex solutions , "" he says . "" Many of the solutions available out there work in a lab but it 's not so easy to get them working efficiently in the field . So the SI spends a lot of time on system specification and deployment rather than identifying and converting opportunities . "" <p> Simpson worked with First Distribution on a major smart city tender towards the end of 2019 . The two parties then decided to take the synergies forward with the launch of the Digital Security and IoT division under the First Distribution umbrella . <p> "" With First Distribution , we were able to propose a solution based on Tier One that brands came in at a better price than any of the other tenders , and we realised there is an opportunity to take this business forward . "" <p> First Distribution brings its data centre product stack of servers , storage and networking , coupled with a wealth of expertise to the party . This combines with the physical security expertise from Simpson and his team , allowing the new division to offer a complete turnkey solution in all aspects of digital security and IoT . <p> "" The CCTV camera was the first , and is still the most common IoT device in the market , "" Simpson explains . "" The information associated with these cameras could be worth millions to companies if they are able to properly mine it and extract meaningful metadata . "" <p> By adding analytics , artificial intelligence and video synoptics to the security and IoT arena , First Distribution can now help customers to unlock this value and more , becoming more competitive and profitable as a result . <p> Simpson explains that IT and security are typically handled by different departments within large organisations . "" There has traditionally been a disconnect between the two departments . The value we bring is that we speak both languages fluently , bridge the gap , and develop relevant solutions based on top brands . "" <p> Simpson cites the example of a mine using cameras to analyse traffic in and out of an open cast mine , then using the data to streamline flows , prevent bottlenecks , and increase productivity . Another customer uses cameras and machine learning to warn operators if production line equipment is about to fail , saving time , optimising maintenance , reducing product wastage , and ultimately increasing profitability . <p> Partners have been positive about the new division , he adds . "" They recognise that with First Distribution 's ICT expertise , infrastructure and supply chain coupled with the in-depth security industry knowledge , we can offer a superior product and service . They see it , and they get it . <p> "" This is important : the SIs want to work with us because we can deploy a holistic solution of behalf of their clients . They can feel more confident in selling solutions , knowing that we will support them from beginning to end -- as we say , from ' Seen to Screen ' . "" <p> Another value-add that First Distribution offers is the ability to develop new solutions . Simpson points to a new offering the team has been working on during the Covid-19 lockdown that combines no-touch access control with fever sensors to ensure the health and safety of workers . Other solutions can be custom-built for customers according to their specific needs . <p> First Distribution has a footprint throughout Africa , with a physical presence in 7 countries , and actively trading in 28 countries on the continent , with a partner ecosystem of more than 2000 active resellers . <p> Simpson believes the market opportunity in South Africa and Africa could be as much as $5-billion over the next five years . <p> The initial sales opportunities are in the manufacturing , retail , commercial and industrial environments . <p> Joining Simpson in the new division are national sales manager Matthew Short and national technical lead Francois Malan . A full team of internal and external sales specialists and technical experts is on board . <p> "" Our skilled and trained technology specialists are the backbone of our business , and they are always available to guide partners through any technical difficulties , "" Simpson says . <p> The core distribution function of logistics has also been optimised to ensure that products arrive on time , and all orders are handled with the priority they deserve . <p> In addition , regular training is provided for partners , to ensure they are up to speed on all First Distribution 's brands and product verticals . <p> About First Distribution <p> First Distribution is the leading value-added distributor in Africa . Our offering includes a product portfolio of global leading Datacentre , Cloud , Networking and Cybersecurity products and services . This embraces hybrid solutions with access to any combination of on-premise , private cloud and public cloud end-to-end solutions from multiple vendors .

"<p> Open-sourced projects branched out from the free-software movement which began in the late 80s . Almost every big tech organisation has been open-sourcing its innovative projects to the public as well as the developer communities for several years now . <p> According to the 2018 Open Source Program Management survey by Linux Foundation , open-source projects are set to be the best practice for organisations in the field of technology , telecom , finance , among others . Tech giants are open sourcing projects with a view to establishing processes that enable developers and their teams while encouraging standard coding and organisational practices , processes , and toolsets . <p> Here are three top tech giants that have open-sourced software projects mentioned below <h> Facebook React <p> Created by a software engineer at Facebook , React is a front-end library which helps a developer to build user interfaces through JavaScript . Two years ago , Facebook re-licenced React and make it an open-source project including a number of patent-related clauses . This step by Facebook has also created several controversies and issues among the developers and other organisations such as the Apache Foundation and it finally led the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects available under the MIT license . <h> Google Kubernetes <p> In 2018 , Google set its container project , Kubernetes open-sourced to the public in order to develop Kubernetes at its best . Not just Kubernetes , the tech giant has open-sourced various multi-cloud and machine learning tools such as Knative , Istio , TensorFlow , etc . Researchers at Google discovered that open-sourcing these tools will not only help the developers but also help the project itself by building a community of the developers . In this way , the organisations will have the accessibility to work with the tools in multi-cloud platforms along with their own data centres . <h> IBM Hyperledger <p> In 2017 , the big blue chose the Hyperledger Fabric as the foundation for the IBM Blockchain Platform in order to enable performance at scale while preserving privacy to deliver an interoperable network-of-networks . With the help of this platform , the customers from any private company or government organisation will be able to set up a trusted network by which they can share important information securely . In this platform , a developer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VS ) Code extension for smooth integration between smart contract development and network management and much more . <h> Benefits of Open-Source Projects <p> Open-source projects are collaborative in nature , which means that the software can be customised as preferable for the developers <p> Developers with a keen interest in coding can code and modify the open-source project with the developer 's community <p> The open-source projects not only help the developers but also the organisations they are built-in . <p> The open-source projects provide much higher flexibility than closed projects . <p> It allows smaller organisations to take part in the global economy <h> Outlook <p> Open source projects have now become very common in large organisations . Reports suggest that 99% of the IT leaders believed that open-sourcing projects are at least "" somewhat important "" to their enterprise IT strategy . <p> In the present scenario , there are millions of developers who are contributing to the open-source community .

"<p> Addressing the gathering , the President said that Dr Ram Manohar Lohia dedicated his life to the welfare of the people , and struggled relentlessly for the deprived sections of society . For Dr Lohia , the definition of weaker sections of society included Dalits , tribals , women and backward castes . He suggested providing them "" special opportunity "" . Dr Lohia had said that if it were a choice between "" equal opportunity "" and "" special opportunity "" , then "" special opportunity "" should be chosen . There can be talk of "" equal opportunity "" only when everyone has equal access to education , employment , livelihood , etc . <p> The President said Dr Lohia could be called the Sant Kabir of Indian politics due to his endless striving , ceaseless political journey , and courage to abandon everything for his beliefs , and ability to speak the truth directly .

"<h> The Oracle autonomous database : how Larry Ellison plans to stay on top of the software food chain <p> Promising to halve the costs by half for Amazon cloud users with Oracle 's self-driving cloud option , Larry Ellison may have just set the ball rolling on a revolutionary step in software progression . <p> If only people knew that Larry Ellison , Co-founder and Executive Chairman of Oracle Corporation , was introducing an autonomous , self-learning database warehouse cloud that needs no human intervention to manage events and security , they would have been more prepared for the tectonic shift happening in the world thanks to software . Ellison took a dig at Amazon 's cloud configuration and said that the databases were managed manually , which , according to him , will not be able to handle data theft autonomously , and proves to be expensive in every workload analysis . <p> Oracle claims Amazon Redshift costs nine or 15 times more and that the autonomous cloud can bring costs down for any enterprise . He made a passionate debate for all enterprises on the cloud to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's for cost-saving and efficiency . <p> But before he took on Amazon , and their cloud , the red screens at the Moscone Centre at downtown San Francisco captured Oracle 's achievements in the era of cloud . <p> Indeed Oracle is not yet number one in the cloud ; Amazon , Google and Microsoft dominate every section of the cloud business such as Software as a Service ( SaaS ) , Platform as a Service ( PaaS ) and Infrastructure as a Service ( IaaS ) . But , with the autonomous database and aggressive pricing ( see photo ) , Oracle can dominate the cloud database market in the coming years . <p> The event was peppered with nuggets of the company 's achievements , such as Oracle cloud being 70 percent more efficient than legacy data centres , 74,000 field agents of AT&amp;T using the Oracle cloud on the go and rideshare company Lyft using Oracle HCM to manage talent , even as people waited for Ellison , the star of the evening to announce something groundbreaking . And the man lived up to his promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrative shifting to machine learning ( ML ) and artificial intelligence ( AI ) from legacy hardware and software , Ellison had a lot to say about the chaos of our times and why data needs to be protected . <p> "" Cyber warfare is here . It is our computers versus theirs ; only autonomous databases are the ones that will detect infiltrators in the system , which humans can not do , "" Ellison quipped . <p> The dark web and state actors can do anything with data and Ellison wishes to take them all on . <p> The Oracle cybersecurity system identifies a threat and it combats the threat . "" The database system will immediately patch itself and not wait for a human being to schedule downtime , "" Ellison said , adding that this a critical benefit with an autonomous database system . <p> "" AI has not lived up to its promise . There is machine learning , which really is the first branch of AI , "" he explained . <p> Adding that machine learning is dramatic and revolutionary by the charisma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "" The car drives by itself today , autonomous is very different from automated , remember that . "" . <p> According to Ellison , ML is easy to understand because it is based on computers looking at lots of data and finding normal and abnormal patterns from that piece of data . <p> Today , every digital data gets logged and only the computer can take the log data and unify it to understand normal and abnormal patterns . Computers are being trained to recognise these anomalies and learn fast . Remember , Target got hit with credit card data theft from their database and , similarly , Chrysler cars were hacked . The computers failed to determine anomalies that stole the data . In these cases , by the time humans realised the DOS attacks the losses ran into billions , and the companies would not come out in the public about the total loss . <p> About 99.995 percent availability time is important and downtime will not happen with the new Oracle 's autonomous database , Ellison assured . "" There is no fine print here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunes itself . It is elastic in using computer resources ; it allocates compute capacity for important queries , "" he explained . <p> "" Take an Oracle workload and run it on Amazon and the price will be halved , "" Ellison said , adding that the autonomous database will also be more reliable in terms of availability . The first one will be launched in December this year . <h> Winds of change <p> With this move to harnessing autonomous cloud to protect data , startups and companies would , without doubt , want to lap up the technology . This system will also change the way IT services companies function , their entire setup and the monitoring business of infrastructure will also be hit . Companies like TCS and Wipro could be the worst hit in this case as more than 75 percent of their revenues come from infra management and ADM business . In an infra management business , around 40 software engineers would be assigned to managing a project . With this self-learning system humans would not need to be put in place to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only be needed to install the database . But , with the Oracle autonomous database resource elasticity and no downtime will become commonplace . However . Ellison promises that DB professionals need not worry of loss of jobs because they can work on schema of DBs and using ML to secure data . <p> "" People are getting better at stealing data and we have to get better at protecting it , "" Ellison warned . <p> The first quarter earnings of 1Q18 cloud SaaS revenue of Oracle 's were $1.1 billion , up 61 percent from last year . Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenue for the quarter were $403 million , up 28 percent from last year . The gross margin for SaaS in the quarter was 67 percent ; up from 59 percent last Q1 . Oracle has 4,30,000 customers worldwide and some of its partners spoke about digital transformation with the cloud . <h> Cloud-first business in an era of data <p> Doug Fisher , SVP General Manager Software and Services Group , at Intel said the world was going through a major transformation . "" The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Data is not a finite resource and is impacting how we live , and it is massive , "" he said , adding that innovation is happening in the cloud and business transformation is key today in a digital world . <p> "" All industries are using ML to investigate what is going on with data . One must watch out for blockchain and the technology is going to change how economic transactions happen , "" he said . <p> Services companies like Infosys , TCS and Wipro are using data to deliver better value for large corporations . It is indeed an era of data . Things like an autonomous car can generate 4,000 GB of data per day , and that needs crunching , which is a business opportunity by itself . Think about what it can do to people because there will be 250 million hours of idle time thanks to autonomous cars . <p> Even the sports industry is using the cloud and data . Jo ? o Cerqueira , big data architect at Perform , said sports is also changing thanks to real-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best players and create the best plays . It can also analyse fitness and save on costs , "" he added . Video , sensors and historic data tells a sports company about the evolution of the player . This is part of business and technology transformation . Seventy Abopercent of the data in the world will be mobile and video . In each second one million one-minute videos will be uploaded . Questions on latency would be something that organisations would want to address . <p> "" We have thousands of databases that need to be scaled and we have to move from legacy . We are signing an agreement with Oracle for network virtualisation , "" said Melissa Arnoldi , SVP , AT&amp;T Technology and Operations , adding that their customers needed the best services , and now with 5G services there has to be scalability of the network through virtualisation . <p> If one looks at the AT&amp;T network the data generated has increased by 2,50,000 percent , by volume , in the network over a decade . AT&amp;T wants to virtualise the network and is working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide how to move data without having to add new servers to manage the network . Fifty-five percent of the AT&amp;T network will be virtualised by 2018 , and by 2020 75 percent of the network will become a virtualised network . <p> There is cold data , warm data and hot data in this world . Hot data being data that needs to be accessed immediately , like the autonomous vehicle . Cold data would be data being stored without any value and could be historical data . So while the world figures out the narrative of the new oil there will be 44 zettabytes generated by 2020 , with 20 billion connected devices as predicted by Gartner . But one can not emphasise enough on how everyone will follow that which makes people consumers faster . Maybe we are truly dependent on the device and finally the cloud-led ML era will open the world of AI by 2035 , when machines know us better than us . <p> shares <p> Last day to apply for the Dell Startup Challenge Season 2 .

On site , guests can expect great music , food and drink , Luxe Lounge , sponsor activations , interactive beauty stations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ready to lead the way in global agtech <p> Australian startups will soon be leading the way in global agricultural technology , according to those working most closely with them . But that does n't mean they 've got an easy road ahead . <p> Agtech has been an ongoing theme of 2018 so far , with several startups cropping up ( pun intended ) and raising millions to make life easier for the Australian farmers , producers and distributors . <p> In February this year , Agridigital , a startup using blockchain technology to track the grain supply chain , and to verify all deals throughout the chain , raised $5.5 million in a raise led by Square Peg Capital . <p> In April , another blockchain startup , BlockGrain , raised $3.5 million in an ICO pre-sale , before closing its ICO in July , having raised $4.63 million . The startup is intended to reduce inefficiency in agriculture , giving farmers and grain brokers better visibility of the supply chain , through a blockchain-based platform . <p> More recently , we have seen farming software startup AgriWebb -- which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- raise a huge $14 million from British agricultural investment company Wheatsheaf , which also included the acquisition of British software platform FarmWizard in the deal . <p> And just this month , fledgling startup MEQ probe secured a $500,000 investment from farming industry heavyweights to test and develop its technology for testing the quality of meats . <p> Speaking to StartupSmart , Tristan Shannon , head of product at AgriDigital , says the agtech space has been "" alive and well "" for a while already . <p> "" But it 's not as mainstream and has n't generated as much publicity and investors ' interest , "" he says . <p> The uptick in investment and interest is coming from heightened consumer interest in where their food is coming from , and a desire to make healthy choices , and ethical choices , based on that . <p> For food producers , "" there 's a gap in the ability to answer a lot of those questions "" , he says . <p> "" We 're seeing the digitisation of agriculture driven around the consumer desire to really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lai is chief executive of SproutX , an accelerator and VC fund now supporting its second cohort of agtech startups . According to Lai , Australia already has a competitive advantage here . <p> "" Australia is known for its fresh food and agriculture , "" he tells StartupSmart . <p> However , "" there 's a lot of conservatism within the agriculture industry "" , and it can take time to get people on board . However , times are changing , Lai says , and people are starting to realise technology could be applied to bring efficiencies to all kinds of agricultural industries . <p> But Petra Andr ? n , chief executive of Cicada Innovations , which runs agtech accelerator GrowLab -- also in its second year -- says , actually , Australian farmers are very happy to adopt new technologies . In Australian , varied and often challenging farmland , along with high labour costs , mean farmers are forced to innovate . <p> "" They do n't have a choice , "" she says . <p> "" Australia is home to every single type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our climatic diversity . When combined with the fact that our farmers are highly innovative early adopters , we make a great test bed for new agri technologies , "" she adds . <p> And that test bed is paying off , Andr ? n says . Before launching GrowLab , Cicada conducted some research with agricultural producer-owned industry body Meat &amp; Livestock Australia , to see what kind of research was being conducted in the agtech space in Australia . <p> They found "" there were an awful lot of ideas to be unearthed "" , she says . <p> GrowLab focuses specifically on science-based , or deep learning agri-food startups , helping research projects to grow into startups , and providing them with a "" validated commercialising pathway "" , Andr ? n says . <p> These types of startups are more likely to be funded through grants than VC funding , and so can often fly under the radar . But "" agtech incorporates a broad range of solutions "" , Andr ? n adds , and a lot of new and emerging technologies can be applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What we see and are interested in includes deep technology , science-based businesses working on everything from robots and drones , driverless vehicles , ground-based sensors and aerial imaging , through to the analytics and artificial intelligence platforms needed to understand all the new data streams being created , "" she says . <p> The SproutX VC fund has invested in 19 startups in the space of a year , Lai says , making it one of the most active startup accelerators in the world . All of this shows activity in the industry , which promises a bright future , he says . <p> Australians can get stuck in a mindset that the more developed agtech and startup sectors in the US , Israel or the Netherlands means those startups will be better than Australian ones . <p> "" I do n't think that 's necessarily the case , "" Lai says . <p> "" There 's no reason some of our startups ca n't do just as well . "" <p> Andr ? n agrees , adding that agtech just is n't a mature market in Australia yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced mentors . <p> There 's value in "" having a mentor pool -- founders that have been there and done that , that we can tap into "" , she says . <p> A the agtech sector is fairly young in Australia , so "" we do n't have that , "" she says . <p> Australia does n't have as developed an ecosystem as the likes of the US , Israel or the Netherlands , Andr ? n says . <p> "" But we have things they do n't have , and there 's no reason we ca n't catch up , "" she adds . <p> The future may look bright for agtech startups , but that does n't mean it 's going to be an easy road for founders . <p> Shannon offers startups a word of warning , saying it can be easy to overestimate the size of the market . Sure , the agricultural sector is huge , but founders often find themselves "" overstating the potential numbers of farmers who might buy their products "" . <p> Startups should "" do their potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of pain later "" , he advises . <p> "" When dealing with long-established industry have to be prepared for a slower growth rate than you would probably like , "" he adds . <p> Despite the recent progress , many of these startups are asking their customers to change their business processes from those that have accumulated over years -- even generations . <p> Startups have to work with their customers "" and work side-by-side to go about changing business practices , as opposed to putting it out there and hoping they use it "" , Shannon says . <p> SmartCompany is the leading online publication in Australia for free news , information and resources catering to Australia 's entrepreneurs , small and medium business owners and business managers . <p> Monday to Friday , SmartCompany.com.au publishes news , business trends and ideas from around the world , profiles and features , as well as all the latest business , tax , legal , marketing , politics and innovation developments occurring around the country ."

This Maxar image shows sediment carried into Palu Bay . Credit : Maxar Technologies <p> Natural disasters showcase the widespread utility of satellite imagery . After earthquakes , landslides , hurricanes and floods , government agencies , nonprofits and emergency responders often turn to electro optical and radar imagery to gauge the severity of the damage , plan rescues , deliver aid and begin rebuilding campaigns . <p> Since 2000 , international space agencies have shared data free of charge through the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters . Increasingly , private companies also publicly release disaster-related imagery and data . <p> Maxar Technologies shares satellite imagery and information to aid disaster response through its Open Data Program . "" We publicly release pre- and post-event imagery over a whole series of natural disasters , "" said Rhiannan Price , Maxar 's Sustainable Development Practice director . "" It is a powerful program and a big part of our data philanthropy approach . "" <p> Planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charter in 2016 . In 2018 , Planet made its participation official , becoming the first private company to contribute data directly to the International Charter . <p> Hurricane Harvey struck Port Arthur , a town 140 kilometers from Houston that houses the largest U.S. oil refinery , in August 2017 . Planet publicly released images showing Port Arthur before and after the hurricane and flooding . This image is shows before the hurricane . Credit : Planet <p> The Charter is activated when a representative of a civil government agency logs into the Charter 's online portal to request support related to a disaster . An on-duty operator verifies the information and forwards the information to an on-call officer , who analyzes the request , considers the disaster 's scope and plans a course of action . <p> Planet supplies PlanetScope imagery , orthorectified , multispectral data with three-meter-resolution , to the International Charter directly . The German Space Agency 's Earth Observation Center , a Planet customer , supplies to supply imagery from Planet 's RapidEye constellation to the International Charter . <p> "" We also make imagery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking to assist in these types of large natural disasters all over the world through Planet.com/DisasterData , "" said Brittany Zajic , Planet 's Disaster Response Operations lead .

They also see how disasters showcase the unique attributes of their space operations . <p> Before Planet established a constellation large enough to acquire daily imagery of Earth 's whole landmass , people usually had to task satellites to gather views of disaster sites . In those cases , it was often difficult to find imagery of the same site immediately before the disaster , said Tara O'Shea , Planet 's forest and land use programs manager . <p> "" It 's very difficult to plan your response when you do n't know what 's been impacted because you ca n't see the site before the disaster , "" O'Shea said .

"<h> SA cloud , AI companies should aid COVID-19 vaccine drive <p> Artificial intelligence ( AI ) is viewed by many experts as the key to unlocking a vaccine for COVID-19 and SA cloud companies have a key role to play in assisting in this drive . <p> So says S'bu Khoza , founder of cloud and AI technology company Sive Setfu ICT Solutions ( Sive.Host ) . A gargantuan effort is underway among research scientists around the world to understand more about the elusive coronavirus . However , vast amounts of data - far too much for human intelligence to process - are being generated about the virus and the pandemic it has caused . <p> "" This has resulted in scientists globally deploying the deep learning capabilities of AI to collate the data to try to uncover patterns that will lead to successful treatment and , hopefully in the course of the next year , a vaccine , "" he says . <p> He believes AI has the potential to find solutions for many of the world 's challenges . However , according to Khoza , one of the limitations of AI , is that large-scale projects such as the current drive to find a vaccine for COVID-19 come with a hefty price tag . "" Existing cloud infrastructure from companies such as Google , Microsoft and Amazon is extremely expensive , particularly for local companies . "" <h> A local opportunity <p> He says , though , with South Africa 's exchange rate at an all-time low , there is an opportunity for local cloud infrastructure businesses to play their part in contributing to the infrastructure needed for the huge volumes of data emerging from global research . Khoza 's organisation supplies businesses with dedicated servers housing deep learning and other cloud-based software applications , and infrastructure building blocks to manage , secure and scale their offerings to customers around the world <p> Prof Salim Abdool Karim , chairman of the government 's COVID-19 advisory team , said during a recent Webinar that SA had an urgent need to contribute its own research to fight the illness . South Africa , with millions of immuno-compromised people who are expected to be seriously affected by the disease , has its own challenges to overcome . <p> Referring to the suggestion that vaccine trials would be conducted in Africa , Karim said : "" We need to conduct our own trials . If we wait for the Northern Hemisphere , then we will be at the back of the queue , "" implying that South Africa would waste no time in continuing with its own research . <p> It is Khoza 's view that South African companies can assist in this drive by providing the necessary cloud infrastructure for AI to be deployed in our own backyard , to maximise the combined deep learning potential of overseas and local research . <h> The need for cheaper infrastructure <p> However , he believes that relying solely on a weak exchange rate to make AI more accessible to researchers and developers of innovative solutions is not a long-term solution . "" We need to find ways to bring down the cost of AI to a sustainable level . "" <p> His business strives to do just that . In 2014 , four years after launching Sive.Host , the company was commissioned to design and build , from the ground up , a deep learning server infrastructure for AI and machine learning consultants Isazi Consulting . <p> The goal from the outset was to develop a robust , fit-for-purpose system at a highly competitive rate , which he said Sive.Host 's did for around five times lower than competitive systems . <p> "" We realised that we had hit upon a successful formula , which led to us repurposing our original model and building more custom applications for the general market . "" <p> One way in which the company has managed to significantly reduce the cost of its custom-built deep learning platforms , is by combining commercially available graphic processing units such as the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080Ti GPUs , with industrial-grade servers . <p> The company also offers a choice of fixed monthly rates or a pay-as-you-go option . <p> This approach has made it affordable for anyone with an interest in AI to access the technology , from large companies and universities doing research in deep learning , to public sector secondary schools and anyone wanting to simply experiment with AI , he says . <h> Human intervention <p> In his opinion , effective deep learning also requires the skills of experts , over and above technology . "" Despite the brain-drain the country has suffered , I believe SA still has some of the world 's finest scientific minds and medical experts . "" <p> "" I think that this , combined with the availability of the vast amount of research already done in countries ahead of us in the pandemic , are hopeful indicators that we may be able to reduce the devastation this country could potentially experience over the coming months , "" ends Khoza."
"<h> Hands-On Guide To Detect Objects In Video In 5 Steps <h> Read Next <p> Object detection techniques are a trend nowadays in the field of computer vision . There are many techniques which are used to detect objects in the scene images and videos . Each of these techniques has its own advantages and limitations in terms of resources and execution time . Detecting objects in videos also requires a lot of technical knowledge and resources . <p> So , there is always a search for an easy and quick method for object detection . In this article , we will show how to detect objects seen in the videos in only 5 steps . We will use the pixellib library in this task which detects objects using instance segmentation . We will also use the pre-trained Mask R-CNN model to identify the objects seen in the videos . In this implementation , we will detect vehicle objects in traffic video . <h> Instance Segmentation <p> Instance segmentation is a technique in computer vision that is used in object detection using image segmentation method . It identifies each instance of the objects present in the images or videos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visual input is splitted into segments to represent the object or part of objects by forming a collection of pixels . Instance segmentation identifies each instance of each object featured in the image instead of categorizing each pixel like in semantic segmentation . <h> Mask R-CNN <p> Mask R-CNN is a variant of Deep Neural Network proposed by Kaiming He et al at Facebook AI Research . This model is used to solve the object instance segmentation problem in computer vision . It detects objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance . It is an extension of Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition . The Mask R-CNN framework for instance segmentation is given below . <p> ( Image Source : Original Research Paper ) <h> Implementation <p> Now , we will discuss the steps through which we will detect the objects in a video . <p> 1 . Install library and dependencies <p> In the first step , we need to install the pixellib library and its dependencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-trained Mask-RCNN weights <p> As we are going to use the Mas R-CNN model to detect objects , we will download its pre-trained weights . <p> Finally , we will get the output video in the working directory .

For the above traffic video , we have got the following video in the out having detected objects . <p> You can define a function to get the videos from YouTube and pass them directly to the function above . So , using the above steps , we could discuss a very easy way to implement the task of object detection in videos .

"<p> In the Industrial Revolution 4.0 , it is no longer about if companies should integrate artificial intelligence ( AI ) into their organisation , but about when and how . <p> While it is natural to worry about AI replacing humans , thankfully , a recent whitepaper by Live with AI noted that jobs brought by the AI revolution wo n't be only reserved to computer specialists , enhanced human roles will emerge as well . <p> The whitepaper noted that this is due to AI disrupting jobs task by task and not by entire job roles -- something HR leaders can leverage on to disrupt disruption . Think about using tasks to better track technology impact , chart clearer pathways between jobs , and improve work prospects for people . <p> With human roles still being very relevant in the age of AI and automation , it is important to take into account the "" human cause "" in an automation journey , augmenting a task that satisfies the worker , not replacing it . This effectively places humans at the heart of the transformation process . <h> Focus on enhancing the innately human skills <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very relevant , that does n't deny the fact that a certain level of adaptation and re-skilling is needed for today 's employees to effectively work with AI . <p> According to the Live with AI whitepaper , skills that should be focused on are these four innately human skills -- i.e. critical thinking , creativity , emotional intelligence and empathy , as well as persuasion and negotiation . <h> #1 Critical thinking <p> Critical thinking is the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgment . It is about being an active learner , rather than a passive recipient of information . <p> As procedural tasks become more and more automated , it is crucial for employees to apply critical thinking to tasks and evaluate a situation using logical thought , rather than merely following well-defined procedures . <p> Recall something you were told or learned in the past 24 hours ( it can be from a conversation , book , or digital media ) . <p> Use a pen and paper to ask yourself these questions : Who said it ? What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did they say it ? Why did they say it ? How did they say it ? <h> #2 Creativity <p> Defined as "" the use of imagination or original ideas to create something ; inventiveness "" , human creativity also extends to creative problem-solving . <p> With AIs increasingly optimising production lines and mass-producing standardised products , there will still be a market for customised individual products built by artisans . Computers ( including AI systems ) only know how to solve problems that are well-defined and follow known rules . Whereas humans can apply out-of-the-box thinking to solve problems and generate new and practical ideas . <p> Hence , in line with the changing consumer needs , businesses will need humans to design and invent the next generation of products and services that meet that demand . <p> Apart from sending employees to creative problem-solving courses , here 's a seven-step process for creative problem solving you can get employees to practise : <p> Clarify and identify the problem <p> Research the problem <p> Formulate creative challenges <p> Generate ideas <p> Combine and evaluate the ideas <p> Draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ideas ) <h> #3 Emotional intelligence and empathy <p> While there is nothing new about businesses using automation instead of humans for customer service , humans are "" inherently social creatures who get emotional value from seeing and interacting with one another . "" Hence , the importance of emotional intelligence and empathy . <p> Humans prefer having people help solve our problems ; less work for employees often means more work for customers . While automation can be used for transactional interactions and to augment human customer service , businesses will need to hire humans with high emotional quotient ( EQ ) for customer service because humans can be emotional whereas technology can not . <p> One way to improve your employees ' emotional intelligence is through mindfulness meditation . <h> #4 Persuasion and negotiation <p> While AIs and computers can offer a great experience for online shopping for commodity purchases , the same does n't apply for purchases that are more personal and less transactional . <p> Persuasion and negotiation skills are closely related to emotional intelligence skills . Humans have evolved ways of deciding whether to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly as 39 milliseconds . However , this does not apply to human/computer interactions since there has n't been enough time for computers or humans to evolve such trust mechanisms . <p> For an organisation to be successful , it needs staff who are persuasive and can negotiate win-win solutions , whether that be between internal stakeholders or with external suppliers or customers . <p> The good news is persuasion and negotiation skills can be learned and there are many universities offering degrees in psychology and marketing that deeply cover the tools required . Alternatively , many online courses on influencing people are also available . <h> Improving staff wellbeing in the age of AI <p> Among others , the whitepaper also touched on how employee wellbeing at work can be improved in the age of AI . <p> With AI being able to replace the repetitive and mundane tasks , freeing up workers to do more creative and meaningful tasks ; the age of AI can provide a golden opportunity to increase a worker 's engagement , job satisfaction , motivation , and reduce burnout . <p> This can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as a better reputation for the company . <p> Management has a key role to play in the improvement of staff well-being in the age of AI . Here are five practical tips to do so : <p> #1 Identify and rectify workers ' pain points Focus on addressing repetitive and manual tasks using AI , particularly those tasks which are time consuming and can cause burnout . <p> #2 Adopt a bottom-up approach by empowering workers Give your staff a voice and choice in identifying the tasks they wish to do . <p> #3 Moderate the frequency and intensity of empathy tasks As lower-order repetitive and manual tasks , workers can transition to doing more empathy tasks which are perceived to be "" AI-resistant "" since it is difficult for technology to replace the human touch . However , excessive frequency and intensity of empathy tasks can be harmful for the worker , draining them emotionally and affecting their mental health . <p> #4 Help workers to effectively multitask As AI systems replace repetitive and manual tasks , workers can transition to more advanced tasks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become overloaded , leading to burnout . Counter this by having policies which allow workers to have sufficient time to focus and prioritise on a singular task when needed , and adequately pacing out their tasks . <p> #5 Define transparency and fairness in the algorithms that staff work with Algorithms in the AI systems that employees work with can profoundly impact how workers carry out tasks and may unintentionally cause discrimination .

They are artificial intelligence ( AI ) , data science , immersive media and the Internet of Things . <p> Unlike a start-up accelerator , Startup Xchange will not invest in or run an intensive three-month programme to groom start-ups . Instead , the programme brings in start-ups to co-create solutions with DBS and the bank 's corporate and small and medium enterprise ( SME ) clients to solve business pain points . <p> Since its pilot launch several months ago , Startup Xchange has matched 21 start-ups with DBS and its clients , resulting in the successful rollout of 10 emerging technology solutions to-date , said DBS . Another ten solutions are expected to be launched over the next 12 months . <p> Startup Xchange also allows start-ups to showcase the solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an anchor client when raising capital with the investor community , DBS said . <p> For instance , Singapore-based AI startup impress.ai has partnered DBS ' human resources team to create JIM , a virtual bank recruiter . Following the partnership , impress.ai has raised US$1.2 million and seen a five-fold increase in monthly revenues , said DBS . <p> To boot , the start-up is now working with 15 large enterprise customers , including AXA , NTUC Income and Singtel . <p> Bidyut Dumra , head of DBS ' innovation group , said Startup Xchange is a win-win for both the bank and the start-up community . <p> "" Start-ups sometimes have the brightest minds to develop the most cutting-edge technology solutions but they lack an anchor client and continuous funding . Startup Xchange is great as it helps the ecosystem of start-ups , DBS and its customers to commercialise emerging technology solutions to quickly achieve shared business goals . "" <p> To start with , DBS has launched the Startup Xchange programme in its two largest markets , Singapore and Hong Kong . DBS said the programme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank in 2015 to support the development of start-ups . <p> DBS said its research found that 78 per cent of accelerators launched in Singapore over the past three years are now defunct as many start-ups had failed without the continued support from established sponsors and partners . <h> The Straits Times <p> We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused .

"<p> From a full-fledged tuberculosis campaign to a degree-level online course , Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a slew of measures to improve public health and upgrade the quality of education in India as part of this year 's Budget . <p> The first Budget of this decade was woven around three pillars -- creating a new aspirational India with access to health , education , and employment for all , boosting economic development , and spurring a caring society . <p> Several schemes such as the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan , Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network , and Ayushmann Bharat -- the extension of the National Health Mission ( NHM ) have been implemented by the government to better the healthcare of the country . <p> Nirmala Sitharaman just before presenting the Budget . <p> The government has also been givingimportance to the education sector , starting in 2000 when it launched the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan and in 2015 , with the launch of the ' Beti Bachao Beti Padhao ' initiative . <p> This time too , Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a slew of measures to improve public healthcare and upgrade the quality of education in India as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper penetration of technology <p> One of the key initiatives that the government proposed on February 1 , 2020 , was the addition of more hospitals across Tier-II and III cities . Presently , under the PM Jan Arogya Yojana ( PMJAY ) , more than 20,000 empanelled hospitals have been erected . The Finance Minister suggested an increase in this number with the help of a public-private partnership ( PPP ) model , and also made a provision for viability gap funding . <p> Delhi-based healthtech startup Navia Life Care , which especially focusses on patient care is in support of the move . <p> "" From the healthcare sector perspective , setting up more hospitals can help tackle the accessibility issue effectively . Besides , it will assist startups like us to expand our market and reach , "" Gaurav Gupta , Co-founder , Navia Life Care says . <p> With digital technology being integrated into the healthcare sector , positive changes in diagnostics , care processes , treatment variability , and patient outcomes have been quite evident . According to the Future Health Index of 2019 published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in adopting new technologies in its health ecosystem , with 88 percent of the professionals using mobile apps or other algorithmic interventions . <p> In line with this , the government has announced the use of concepts like machine learning ( ML ) and artificial intelligence ( AI ) in the Ayushmann Bharat scheme , to enable the medical fraternity to target diseases using a preventive approach . <p> For instance , healthtech startup Omnicuris has been working towards providing digital skills to medical practitioners . The startup 's CEO , Savitha Kuttan , believes that the penetration of technology in the medical field needs to be coupled with addressing the skill gap . <p> "" At present , the doctor-patient ratio is 1:1445 against the WHO recommended 1:1000 , and the nurse-patient ratio is 1:483 against the ideal 1:4 . Although the National Medical Commission was established to address the skill gap in the health sector , we expected more clarity from the government on its plan to increase graduate and postgraduate seats in medical education . Just like hospitals , setting up more medical institutes would have helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds . <p> Sitharaman also announced certain specific interventions as part of the Budget . <p> "" We have already launched the ' TB Harega Desh Jeetega ' campaign . However , we propose to strengthen the efforts of this initiative to realise our commitment to end Tuberculosis by 2025 . Besides this , I propose to expand the Jan Aushadhi Kendra scheme to all districts offering 2,000 medicines and 300 surgicals by 2024 , "" she said . <p> The government has allocated Rs 69,000 crore towards the healthcare sector , which is inclusive of the Rs 6,400 crore already directed towards the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana . This is a clear jump as compared to Rs 62,659 crore earmarked last year . <p> "" Even though the Budget allocation to this sector represents about a 10.5 percent jump from 2019 in absolute terms , India 's spending stands at a little over one percent of the GDP . Hence , I feel that we have a long way to go when compared to other developing countries , where public healthcare spending stands at around 2 to 2.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New education policy and better internship opportunities <p> India houses one of the youngest populations in an ever-ageing world . A recent Bloomberg News analysis reiterated this by stating that the nation is likely to have the largest workforce by 2027 , with a billion people aged between 15 and 64 years . This trend increases the need for having a robust framework to increase the quality of education , to accommodate more people in the workforce . <p> Conforming to this demand , the government confirmed the launch of a new education policy in the upcoming days . Sitharaman also proposed an allocation of Rs 99,300 crore and Rs 3,000 crore for education and skill development respectively . <p> Additionally , sourcing External Commercial Borrowings and FDI for the education sector are on the cards . <p> On the other hand , Amol Arora , Vice Chairman and MD , Shemford Group of Futuristic Schools feels the need for a larger push . <p> "" ECBs and FDI for was a much-needed move . However , the government should look beyond this and attract more domestic investments as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be worth it since quality education has the capacity to deliver the highest ROI for India , "" he says . <p> With a view to embed practical learning in academia , the Finance Minister announced apprenticeshipembedded degree and diploma courses across 150 higher educational institutions by March 2021 . Along with this , she introduced internship opportunities to fresh engineers for a period of up to one year in urban local bodies . <p> India poses a clear inequality when it comes to access to higher education . For example , as per the data presented by the NSSO in 2016-17 , only 21 percent of Scheduled Castes and 15.4 percent of Scheduled Tribes obtain higher education , as against the overall gross enrolment ratio of 25 percent . <p> To enable the deprived sections of society to gain access to better opportunities , the government declared a degree-level online education programme under the ambit of the top 100 National Institutional Ranking framework . <p> Rachit Jain , CEO and Founder of Youth4Work , an assessment and skill-based people-profiling startup , has a promising view of the recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big announcements in lieu of Prime Minister 's vision , which will play a big role in transforming India 's educational landscape .

These are commercial agriculture and commodities , concentrating on smart or precision farming ; manufacturing -- transforming to Industry 4.0 ; forestry with a focus on reforestation ; tourism with efforts to increase visitor economy ; mining and its exploration towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hydrogen , biomass and solar energy ; and services on access to affordable and quality of services . <p> "" These economic sectors are in turn driven by the six enabler sectors , namely digital transformation , innovation and entrepreneurship , education , infrastructure , transport and utilities .

"" <p> Abang Johari also reiterated that last month , he had announced and allocated additional RM50 million for the installation of mini satellite stations ( VSAT ) to furtherimprove connectivity in underserved rural areas . <p> "" I believe that installing VSAT stations is the best way to solve the problem of poor internet connectivity in rural areas quickly . "" <p> In addressing the challenges of providing high-speed connectivity , particularly in Sarawak , Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission ( MCMC ) Digital Services and Standards Sector chief operating officer Datuk Mohd Ali Hanafiah Mohd Yunus explained during the panel session that whenever they embark on an initiative or a journey , there will always be challenges along the way . <p> "" That was why before we started anything , we commenced the National Digital Infrastructure Lab ( NDIL ) , which was actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , agencies and SMA was also involved as well , "" Hanafiah said . <p> "" The lab went on for about one month . The lab discussed the aspirations , the short term , the medium term and also targets and what are the obstacles or the hurdles that will be coming up . <p> "" Apart from that , there are also learnings that we got from the Covid-19 pandemic that we ca n't just push it aside . We saw internet traffic increase by 30 to 70 per cent and then we saw internet usage moving up into the residential areas by about 50 to 70 per cent . <p> "" Internet speed however has reduced or slowed down due to this by about 30 to 40 per cent . And complaints on internet speed on new coverage areas and also indoor coverage have increased by about 40 to 70 per cent . "" <p> Hanafiah explained that all this needed to be considered in the Jendela planning . <p> The outcome was that Jendela was approached , through a phase approach , as MCMC had targets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were targets to be completed by 2022 , which was categorised as mid-term . MCMC also has targets that go beyond this , to be completed on a long term basis , within the 12th Malaysia Plan ( RMK12 ) period . <p> "" From this year , we did a stock take . We have already connected about 4.9 million fibre premise pass and we want to increase this further . The planning is that with Jendela , by year 2022 , we should be achieving about 7.5 million premise pass by then , in terms of 4G coverage . <p> "" Today , we are at 91.8 per cent populated coverage and we are targeting this to grow until 96.9 per cent by 2022 . In terms of mobile speed , we are experiencing about 25mbps today and by 2022 , we are targeting this to be increased up to 35mbps . <p> "" The aspirations is actually to enhance the rakyat 's experience on seamless connectivity at the urban , suburban and also rural areas . <p> "" Also , to maximise 4g infrastrucutre and tehcnology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of experince is incorporated as part of the quality measurements .

Jendela will bring additional 43,000 premises to be equipped with access to fibre , approximately 700 new towers to be built and upgrading of about 2,000 existing base stations to be able to provide 4g coverage on a commercial basis . <p> "" Apart from that , there will be 600 additional new towers to be built , 1,000 existing base stations to be upgraded and copper migration for 21,000 subscribers , all under our universal service provisioning initiative . <p> "" We will definitely be working together closely with the Sarawak state government and one relevant agency that we are always working closely would be the SMA . "" <p> MCMC has identified areas to be covered with SMA , while there have also been discussions on any hurdles and the best technology to be used . <p> "" There are areas within the urban and suburban areas that can be finalised instantaneously but obviously when we go further into the rural and remote areas , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as VSAT and satellite technologies . <p> "" In terms of supporting the digital economy , we always have the access in terms of personal access and on the other hand , we also have the ' collective access ' . <p> "" Through collective access , this is where we have our internet centres or pusat internet communities that we have in place for the communities to come and utilise the infrastructure that we already have . <p> "" All of these internet centres are equipped with at least a bandwidth of 20mbps . They will have teachings on ICT and also online entrepreneurship . As it is today , we have already established 129 of these pusat internet communities for Sarawak . "" <p> Digital inclusivity <p> Under digital inclusivity , the Chief Minister revealed that Digital Community Centres ( DCCs ) are being developed throughout the State to provide digital skills training and capacity building programmes . <p> This is to ensure that all Sarawakians will benefit from the digital economy . <p> "" These digital inclusivity initiatives will help in developing local socio-economic sector by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformation , "" he explained . <p> "" It is hoped that these efforts will create a sustainable and resilient community that is technologically savvy while maintaining their respective values and identity .

"" <p> Meanwhile , Morshidi said of digital inclusivity and readiness , that awareness programs have been undertaken while adaptation by community and so forth , are all well and good . <p> "" I think more effort should be put into that . The key thing on how people can uptake and adapt to the new technology is to use user experience , "" Morshidi said during the panel session . <p> "" Sarawak Pay , for example , is a good fintech platform which is used to reach every single merchant and user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one way of trying to reach as many people as possible . Sarawak ID is another one . "" <p> Morshidi added that the agropark will be a good user case for farmers to see how technology can be used , and as well as smart city and smart homes , these are all user case that can be used to reach and to get people to really accept and adopt digital technology . <p> Digital talents <p> In addressing the current state of human capital for the digital economy , the Chief Minister observed that when it comes to translating technological innovations into a real business , technology is relatively easy to come by but it is the talent that is often the limiting factor . <p> He opined that there is a significant skills gap between businesses current capabilities and skills needed to achieve its goals and meet customer demand . <p> "" Advancements in technology such as artificial intelligence ( AI ) , blockchain , Industry 4.0 , nanotechnology , virtual or augmented reality , robotics , cybersecurity and other emerging technologies are revolutionising the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skillsets needed . <p> "" For example , while AI creates new opportunities , the jobs will necessitate a separate set of skills . "" <p> Abang Johari gathered that as new roles arise and job requirements fluctuate , the scope of the existing talent in skilled workers may not cope with the changing demand . <p> "" It is very challenging for industries to future-proof their personnel just by simply hiring new employees . What is necessary is a holistic approach and initiatives that will equip the current workforce with necessary skills . Such initiatives would require shared responsibility between corporations , governments and education providers . <p> "" We also need to ensure that technological advances do not result in economic imbalance as lower-skilled employees become unemployed . "" <p> He said that in addition to digital skills , there is a strong demand for soft skills such as project management , decision making , critical thinking , communication , design thinking and negotiating which will empower people to equip with the competencies of the digital revolution . <p> "" To address these challenges , we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "" <p> On the topic of digital talents , Morshidi pointed out that underlying the application of digital technology is the talent . <p> "" If we go into data , innovation and so forth , talent will encompass a lot of professions such as data analysts , data scientists , programmers , and even ethical hackers and so forth . This profession is not easy to come by and will be a challenge for us . Probably even in the next five years , we will not be able to produce this level of people . <p> "" But for me , maybe the effort by the government like science , technology , engineering and mathematics ( STEM ) education , private schools which are largely science schools , digital academy at Centexs where we are improving the skills of the people in every aspect of it , and of course to bring back our talent from overseas , these are good initiatives but I think that will take a bit of time . "" <p> As such , Morshidi has proposed to welcome more digital nomads into Sarawak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . <p> "" Maybe we can open a little bit our doors as an interim measure to people like digital nomads . Digital nomads are basically people who are location independent entrepreneurs and location independent programmers . These people are actually already here in some places in Sarawak . <p> "" They are independent , they will go to every part of the world , they travel everywhere in the world and hibernate in each place where they stay and they will use their programming skills to help industries . <p> "" It could be a way where we can provide a kind of extended visa for them to stay , six months or maybe a year , so they can be used as an interim measure to fill the gap of our talent . "" <p> Digital government <p> Other initiatives highlighted by Morshidi include digitalising government services and adopting the e-Residency concept , which can help increase the uptake of technology in the private sector . <p> The target under the aspiration of the Sarawak Economic Development Agenda is to achieve 100 per cent digital government services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> "" With that kind of target , we will be able to be a global player . Estonia 's government services is already 99 per cent digitalised . This is where Sains will play a major role to help to digitalise alot of government services . <p> "" Because investors , private sectors , they need efficient and fast service so digitalising government services is the only way out . "" <p> He noted that the challenge is making both federal and state government services interoperable and integrated for a more seamless experience . <p> "" I 'm giving the example of a trading license , if a small and medium enterprise ( SME ) or entrepreneur wants to apply for a trading license , they have to go through the federal government department agencies and also state government agencies . <p> "" First , they will have to get the police permission ( federal ) .

"<p> For the past three years , property investor Earnest Wong had been finding it difficult to deal with some of the tenants of his properties in Sentul , Kuala Lumpur . <p> "" I rented out my units through online listing platforms and my network of friends , who are property agents . While most of the tenants were good paymasters , some failed to make payments after a few months . I had to constantly remind them about it , "" he tells Personal Wealth . <p> "" As for those who paid on time , I had to answer their calls whenever there were issues such as leaky faucets or overflowing toilet bowls . I would put them in touch with a maintenance guy to solve these problems . The whole process could be quite exhausting . "" <p> These experiences prompted Wong to search online for local solutions that could help him manage these issues . But he could not find any that were affordable . <p> "" There are property managers and real estate agents who offer such services to their clients on a personal basis . But they usually take an 8% to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite significant , "" says Wong . <p> This gave him the idea to start something of his own . In 2016 , he talked with his close friends and family about launching a technology-powered end-to-end property platform for property listings , screening of potential tenants , rental collection , maintenance and provision of legal services . <p> In general , the feedback was negative . "" They said there were many processes involved and these are tedious and mundane , "" says Wong . <p> He had been a commercial banker before he ventured into the insurance industry and founded tackletherisk , an insurance agency under Hong Leong Assurance Bhd . He did not come from the property industry or have much experience dealing with property-related businesses . However , all this did not stop him from registering Blue Duck Tech Sdn Bhd last year to put his plans into action . <p> "" I believed that it would work . The platform would be the first of its kind in the market , "" says Wong . <p> He came up with the name "" Blue Duck "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Property agents assigned to facilitate process <p> Blue Duck provides services to both prospective tenants and landlords . Wong says landlords need to open an account with the platform providing their basic information online . Then , they have to pay a yearly subscription fee of RM350 to access the pool of tenants who have registered with the online marketplace . <p> Landlords , who list their properties on the platform with the help of a property agent , will be notified when prospective tenants make requests to view their properties . They can screen these tenants looking at their credit scores before making further arrangements . "" We have the consent of these tenants to access their credit scoring information provided CTOS Data Systems Sdn Bhd , "" says Wong . <p> Once an ideal tenant has been identified , landlords can click on the approval button on the screen and the property agent , who has been assigned the platform , will arrange for a viewing of the property . A tenancy agreement will be signed when the tenant is satisfied with the outcome . <p> Landlords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent facilitate the process . But for those who do not have one , the company will assign an agent to them , says Wong . "" Some of them may have friends or relatives who work as property agents . They may want to engage the services of people they know . "" <p> He says the platform does not exclude property agents from the process and agents will receive a one-month rental fee for providing landlords with their services . "" We are not disrupting the traditional rental market , but trying to make the existing process smoother utilising technology . From a business perspective , it is a more viable business model as about 80% to 90% of property transactions are still done through agents . "" <p> The additional value that Blue Duck provides include rental collection and maintenance services , says Wong . On the collection side , the company plays the role of rental collector to remind tenants to pay their rents when the due date is near . The money will be transferred from the tenants ' bank account to the company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> After the transaction has been done , tenants are required to upload their receipt to the platform , which will then notify the landlords of the payment . "" The landlords will receive payment within three business days , "" says Wong . <p> It should be noted that the three months ' deposit paid the tenants is sent directly to the landlords ' bank account . The company does not conduct any deposit-taking activity . <p> What if the tenants refuse to pay the rent ? "" We have our legal advisers ready to take further action , "" says Wong . <p> If a tenant disappears without making payments , the platform will blacklist the person and block him from using the platform . Meanwhile , the landlord 's property will be relisted online . <p> "" From the company 's perspective , challenges arise when tenants do not pay their rent . We are the party that manages this and it is in our interests to attract good tenants to our platform , "" says Wong . <p> A partnership between Blue Duck and Kaodim.com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenants . "" Instead of calling the landlords , tenants can go to our website , which is partly powered Kaodim.com , to solve many of their maintenance issues , "" he says . <p> Landlords who subscribe to the platform are entitled to home content insurance with an assured sum of RM10,000 and fire insurance of RM130,000 . "" Any damage caused fire is covered the fire insurance while piping issues and furniture damage is covered the home content insurance . However , wear-and-tear damage , such as those caused cleaning or fixing the air-conditioning unit , is not covered the insurance and requires tenants to fork out their own money , "" says Wong . <p> Challenges ahead <p> According to Wong , Blue Duck is unique compared with other property technology ( proptech ) start-ups . For instance , there is a platform in the market that facilitates the listing and rental of properties as well as helps to screen potential tenants using their credit scores . However , these platforms do not provide landlords with after-sales facilities such as rental collection and maintenance services , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage where a sale and purchase or tenancy agreement is signed . But we go beyond that . "" <p> Wong has plans to collect rental data through the platform for further analysis and prediction . "" We could tell people what the rental rates are like in certain areas and probably predict the trends going forward harnessing the capability of artificial intelligence . Several portals in the market have property transaction data , which means the buying and selling prices of properties in the market . But none of them have rental data , "" he says . <p> Thus , Wong is on the lookout for potential investors . "" We are looking out for strategic partners who would allow us to leverage their strengths . These are players on the ground such as property agencies that can bring their agents and landlords onto our platform . There are a few who have shown strong interest in us , "" he says . <p> "" We are also engaging with banks and other institutional investors that can invest a large amount with us , enhance our brand name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business is based on trust .

"<p> When Yale recently decided to relocate three-quarters of the books in its undergraduate library to create more study space , the students loudly protested . In a passionate op-ed in the Yale Daily News , one student accused the university librarian -- who oversees 15 million books in Yale 's extensive library system -- of failing to "" understand the crucial relationship of books to education . "" A sit-in , or rather a "" browse-in , "" was held in Bass Library to show the administration how college students still value the presence of books . Eventually the number of volumes that would remain was expanded , at the cost of reducing the number of proposed additional seats in a busy central location . <p> Little-noticed in this minor skirmish over the future of the library was a much bigger story about the changing relationship between college students and books . Buried in a slide deck about circulation statistics from Yale 's library was an unsettling fact : There has been a 64 percent decline in the number of books checked out by undergraduates from Bass Library over the past decade . <p> Yale 's experience is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . University libraries across the country , and around the world , are seeing steady , and in many cases precipitous , declines in the use of the books on their shelves . The University of Virginia , one of our great public universities and an institution that openly shares detailed library circulation stats from the prior 20 years , is a good case study . College students at UVA checked out 238,000 books during the school year a decade ago ; last year , that number had shrunk to just 60,000 . <p> Before you tsk-tsk today 's kids for their lack of bookishness , note that the trend lines are sliding southward for graduate students and faculty members , too : down 61 percent and 46 percent , respectively , at UVA . Overall , across its entire network of libraries , UVA circulated 525,000 books during the 2007 -- 08 school year , but last year there were only 188,000 loans -- nearly 1,000 fewer books checked out a day . The Association of Research Libraries ' aggregated statistics show a steady decrease of the same proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universities has grown substantially . <p> Maybe students are n't checking the books out but are still consulting them regularly within the library ? This also does not appear to be true . Many libraries also track such in-house uses , by tallying the books that need to be reshelved , and the trends are the same . At my library at Northeastern University , undergraduate circulations declined 50 percent from 2013 to 2017 -- before we decided to do our own book relocation -- and our logged number of books removed from shelves but not checked out also dropped by half . <p> These stark statistics present a conundrum for those who care about libraries and books . At the same time that books increasingly lie dormant , library spaces themselves remain vibrant -- Snell Library at Northeastern now receives well over 2 million visits a year -- as retreats for focused study and dynamic collaboration , and as sites of an ever wider array of activities and forms of knowledge creation and expression , including , but also well beyond , the printed word . It should come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispassionate assessment often augmented by hearing from students who have trouble finding seats during busy periods , would seek to rezone areas occupied by stacks for more individual and group work . Yet it often does come as an unwelcome surprise to many , especially those with a powerful emotional attachment to what libraries should look like and be . <p> What 's happening here is much more complicated than an imagined zero-sum game between the defenders of books and library futurists . The decline in the use of print books at universities relates to the kinds of books we read for scholarly pursuits rather than pure pleasure , the rise of ebooks and digital articles , and the changing environment of research . And it runs contrary to the experience of public libraries and bookstores , where print continues to thrive . <p> Unlike most public libraries , the libraries of colleges and universities have always been filled with an incredibly wide variety of books , including works of literature and nonfiction , but also bound scientific journals and other highly specialized periodicals , detailed reference works , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of these volumes stand ready for immersive , cover-to-cover reading , others await rarer and often brief consultations , as part of a larger network of knowledge . Even many monographs , carefully and slowly written by scholars , see only very sporadic consultation , and it is not uncommon for the majority of college collections to be unused for a decade or more . This is as it should be : Research libraries exist to collect and preserve knowledge for the future as well as for the present , not to house just the latest and most popular works . <p> But there is a difference between preservation and access , and a significant difference , often unacknowledged , in the way we read books for research instead of pleasure . As the historian Michael O'Malley humorously summarized the nature of much scholarly reading and writing , "" We learn to read books and articles quickly , under pressure , for the key points or for what we can use . But we write as if a learned gentleman of leisure sits in a paneled study , savoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the research process , academics often approach books like "" sous-chefs gutting a fish . "" <p> With the rapidly growing number of books available online , that mode of slicing and dicing has largely become digital . Where students or faculty once pulled volumes off the shelf to scan a table of contents or index , grasp a thesis by reading an introduction , check a reference , or trace a footnote , today they consult the library 's swiftly expanding ebook collection ( our library 's ebook collection has multiplied tenfold over the past decade ) , Google Books , or Amazon 's Look Inside . With each of these clicks , a print circulation or in-house use of a book is lost . UVA 's ebook downloads totaled 1.7 million in 2016 , an order of magnitude larger than e-circulations a decade ago . Our numbers at Northeastern are almost identical , as scholars have become comfortable with the use of digital books for many purposes . <p> I 've seen my own book usage change over time . When I was a graduate student studying Victorian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sterling Library , next door to Bass ( then called Cross Campus Library ) , allowed me to find and leaf through relevant books easily . Now almost all of the texts I consulted for my dissertation are available online in repositories such as HathiTrust , which stores digitized books from research libraries , many of them freely available for download since they were published before 1924 , the cutoff for public-domain works . If I were doing the same scholarly project today , I would likely check out only a small subset of books that I needed to pay careful attention to , and annotate others digitally in my PDF reader . <p> The decline in print circulation also coincides with the increasing dominance of the article over the monograph , and the availability of most articles online . In many fields , we now have the equivalent of Spotify for research : vast databases that help scholars search millions of articles and connect them -- often through highly restrictive and increasingly unsustainable subscriptions , but that is another story -- instantly to digital copies . ( There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall not speak . ) Very few natural and social scientists continue to consult bound volumes of journals in their field , especially issues that are more than a few years old . UVA recorded nearly 3 million e-journal downloads in 2016 , a massive and growing number that is typical of most universities . <p> In addition , the nature of scholarship is also changing , still with significant reading and writing , of course , but also involving the use and processing of data in a wide array of disciplines . To serve these emerging needs , Northeastern University Library has added full-time specialists in data visualization and systematic review ( the process of synthesizing , statistically , exhaustive research from multiple studies ) , and an entire division dedicated to new forms of digital scholarship . <p> Our research library , like many others , has also seen a surge in group work rather than the solitary pursuit of the canonical research paper . More classes are assigning team-based projects instead of individual essays , as many urgent problems , such as climate change , call for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondingly seen reservations for collaboration spaces surge . Last year , we had a record 100,000 hours of group-room bookings in our library , meaning that these spaces were occupied constantly from 8 a.m. to midnight . <p> At the same time -- and perhaps this is one of the feel-good stories related to physical collections -- there is an increasing use of archives . Many students still find the direct encounter with primary sources thrilling , and instructors and library staff have found creative ways for them to use these special collections . We have doubled our archival holdings in the past five years , focusing on Boston-related materials such as our recent acquisition of millions of photographs and negatives from TheBoston Globe , and have greatly expanded our program of teaching with these artifacts . <p> A positive way of looking at these changes is that we are witnessing a Great Sorting within the library , a matching of different kinds of scholarly uses with the right media , formats , and locations . Books that are in high demand ; or that benefit from physical manifestations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are rare or require careful , full engagement , might be better off in centralized places on campus . But multiple copies of common books , those that can be consulted quickly online or are needed only once a decade , or that are now largely replaced by digital forms , can be stored off site and made available quickly on demand , which reduces costs for libraries and also allows them to more easily share books among institutions in a network . Importantly , this also closes the gap between elite institutions such as Yale and the much larger number of colleges with more modest collections . <p> These trends around research collections are likely to continue . A small number of regional pools of books at a monumental scale -- tens of millions of books from scores of universities working together -- are already envisioned in the United States , which will ensure preservation and access for future generations and effectively act as gigantic shared libraries , or what David Prosser , the executive director of Research Libraries UK , has called "" collective collections . "" "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable artefacts than others , "" Prosser has argued . "" No library can be completely universal and decisions need to be made about what to collect and where to store material . By looking at collections collectively we can better serve the needs of readers , ensuring that what we have is well looked after ( and yes , sometimes that means in ' remote-storage ' ) . "" <p> Unfortunately , more troubling factors are also at work in the decline of print books within colleges . Statistics show that today 's undergraduates have read fewer books before they arrive on campus than in prior decades , and just placing students in an environment with more books is unlikely to turn that around . ( The time to acquire the reading bug is much earlier than freshman year . ) And while correlation does not equal causation , it is all too conspicuous that we reached Peak Book in universities just before the iPhone came out . Part of this story is undoubtedly about the proliferation of electronic devices that are consuming the attention once devoted to books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also obviously coincides with the Great Recession and with the steady decline of humanities majors , as students have shifted from literature , philosophy , and history to STEM disciplines -- from fields centered on the book to fields that emphasize the article . <p> When I tweeted about this under-discussed decline in the use of print books in universities , several respondents wondered if , regardless of circulation statistics , we should keep an ample number of books in the library for their beneficial ambience . Even if books are ignored by undergraduates , maybe just having them around will indirectly contribute to learning . If books are becoming wallpaper , they are rather nice wallpaper , surrounding students with deep learning and with some helpful sound-deadening characteristics to boot . If that helps students get into the right mind-set in a quiet , contemplative space , so be it . Maybe they will be more productive , get away from their distracting devices , and perhaps serendipitously discover a book or two along the way . <p> You can certainly see this theory at work in new library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced than at Yale , with books lining the walls of study spaces but not jutting out perpendicularly like the old , high-capacity stacks , so as to leave most of the floor open for tables , chairs , and spaces for group work . Perhaps that is the right approach , the right compromise , for some schools and students . Of course , you can also find students who love spaces without books , or who work better with some background noise -- alas , whenever you discuss these matters , all students tend to generalize from the study space that works for themselves . <p> But there is another future that these statistics and our nostalgic reaction to them might produce : the research library as a Disneyland of books , with banker 's lamps and never-cracked spines providing the suggestion of , but not the true interaction with , knowledge old and new . As beautiful as those libraries appear -- and I , too , find myself unconsciously responding to such surroundings , having grown up studying in them -- we should beware the peril @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all , is what lies beneath their covers , as lovely as those covers may be . <p> We want to hear what you think about this article .

"<h> The inside story of the UK 's biggest coronavirus symptom tracker app <p> The story of Britain 's most successful Covid-19 app -- yes , there is such a thing -- started with twins . <p> Tim Spector , a professor of genetic epidemiology at King 's College London , has been probing and observing identical twins for a long time -- and in Just 1992 he launched the registry TwinsUK to aid research on the subject . His interest was investigating how people with identical genes could grow up to develop radically different traits and illnesses . Take nutrition : identical twins might eat the same food , but react very differently -- maybe one will develop an allergy while the other wo n't ; or their blood sugar level would draw dissimilar curves , with different repercussions on each sibling 's metabolism . <h> Advertisement <p> After decades spent researching twins at King 's College , in 2018 Spector teamed up with technologists Jonathan Wolf and George Hadjigeorgiou to launch a startup called ZOE . In partnership with research institutions and universities in various countries , the company started carrying out its own studies about twins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,000 people ( mostly twins ) responded to various kinds of food . A similar study , with a larger sample , is currently underway . <p> ZOE 's business plan was to combine the data gathered through these studies with machine learning , and eventually develop a consumer product able to predict every person 's individual response to what they eat . According to a company spokesperson , the product would be "" like genetic testing service 23andme , but for eating .

As the virus ripped through the globe , on March 20 Spector resolved to turn to TwinsUK 's volunteers to track whether they were showing any coronavirus symptoms , and how those symptoms progressed over time . He roped in ZOE , too -- which was tasked with creating an app through which twins could report their symptoms . The initial plan was to have all volunteers tested for Covid-19 , but the spokesperson says that it has since proved "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While designing the app , the ZOE team thought that its utility could go well beyond keeping tabs on twins . "" We realised that this was something that we could make even more useful overall -- by getting everybody in the public to participate , "" ZOE president George Hadjigeorgiou says . "" This can help understand how the virus is progressing in the UK and also to help understand whether a particular area is at a high risk . "" <h> Advertisement <p> Hadjigeorgiou says the app was developed and inaugurated with a sense of extreme urgency . "" We just put together a ' SWAT team ' and we worked through the weekend to get it live . "" The result ? The Covid Symptom Tracker . The app went live on Tuesday , both for Android and iOS phones . By Wednesday , Britons had downloaded it over a million times . <p> The app is extremely simple . Users are asked to create an account , and provide information , including age , sex at birth , height , weight , postcode of residence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , they 're asked daily to report any symptom that could be associated with Covid-19 . The list currently includes fever , persistent cough , fatigue , shortness of breath , loss of smell or taste , hoarseness , chest pain , abdominal pain , diarrhoea , drowsiness and confusion , and lack of appetite . Hadjigeorgiou says that as more symptoms get flagged by the international research community as potentially relevant to Covid-19 detection , they will be added to the app . <p> The data gathered this way will be shared with researchers at King 's College and at the Guys and St Thomas ' Hospitals , to get a better sense of how the pandemic is spreading through the UK , and which symptoms should be regarded as telltale signs of a novel coronavirus infection as opposed to the common cold or the seasonal flu . Hadjigeorgiou says that the company has also been trying to get in touch with the UK government and the NHS in order to share their data with them , although whether that would result in a partnership was unclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is talking with NHSX , the NHS 's digital unit . <h> Read next <h> The brutal reality of dying under Italy 's coronavirus lockdown <p> ByAlessio Perrone <p> According to Hadjigeorgiou , information about how symptoms are being reported in various parts of the UK might be even made public .

"<h> India should rethink the crypto ban <h> Banning cryptocurrency will not slow down the changing trends in currencies , but only put certain countries at a disadvantage versus others . <p> On 26 October , one day after President Xi Jinping elevated blockchain to be a Chinese national priority , the Chinese Cryptography Law was passed and will be in effect in January 2020 . This is the same month the Supreme Court of India is expected to hold a hearing on a draft bill to ban cryptocurrency throughout India , proposed by the Inter-Ministerial Committee ( IMC ) in July . The two neighbouring nations are seemingly heading in different directions for what the columnist believes to be the next great technological leap of humanity , as such India must formulate a comprehensive crypto strategy in this new arena of nation-state competition . <p> This arena , which has stirred the imaginations of entrepreneurs and governments alike , is filled with buzzwords , but IMC has done a good job defining the core terms in its crypto-ban bill . Distributed ledger ( or blockchain ) , outside of the scope of the proposed crypto ban , means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded , shared , and synchronized across multiple data stores or ledgers , or a distributed network of different network participants ... "" In plain English , blockchain is the next-generation technology for record keeping that has the benefits of being immutable , transparent , and accessible . In practice , blockchains can cut out in any economic activities the requirement of a middleman , who is often a cost to efficiencies and prone to errors -- I call blockchain an earth-flattener that collapses the vertical gaps of information and organisations . <p> Some real life examples here . Blockchain-enabled upgrades to land records in at least eight states including Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra , and other countries such as Mexico and Ghana have been explored . Voters in several counties in the United States can now vote on their blockchain-enabled smartphone apps , hence greatly improves voter inclusion and reduces fraud . Australian and US stock exchanges are testing faster blockchain-enabled settlement to reduce the time and manpower cost of trading . In the not too distant future , ownership of assets around the world could also be "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the equity of assets now accessible only to the privileged few -- the ultimate financial inclusion . Lastly , in the social justice sphere , censor-proof blockchain in the form of cryptocurrency has served as a truth machine that records stories to aid the rise of the #MeToo movement . All is great with blockchain , and I suspect the ultimate use case for this technology has not even been discovered yet . Now , onto its evil cousin Crypto , the subject of the proposed ban by IMC . <p> CRYPTO <p> Cryptocurrency "" means any information or code or number ... providing a digital representation of value which is exchanged ... with the promise or representation of having inherent value in any business activity ... or functions as a store of value or a unit of account ... "" according to IMC . It is understandable that governments tend to take a reserved or even opposing position , as in the case of crypto , when facing new technology that might disrupt their status quo . Yes , cryptocurrency could pose as a substitute threat to fiat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakness of fiat created by Central banks after years of monetary experiments . The paradigm shift is coming in currencies , as they always do every 100 years , and banning cryptocurrency will not slow down such trends , but only put certain countries at a disadvantage versus others . There are also concerns of money laundering risks with cryptocurrency , which in reality is a myth . Cash and USD are the preferred currency for the criminal for good reasons , because by design the public records of all transactions on Bitcoin , the leading cryptocurrency for example , give law enforcement agencies a leg up in catching bad players , as they have done so in the past . The real problem , the real objective of this column , is to highlight the crypto ban as proposed by IMC will not work in practice and might also suffocate the developments of blockchain . India , or any country , does not want to fall behind in this technological race with national security implications . <p> First of all , cryptocurrency is essentially a string of letters recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding , expressing , and exchanging letters ) raises a fundamental challenge to the freedom of speech as enshrined by Article 19 of the Constitution . In practice , superior cryptos such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are censor-proof ( going back to the #MeToo example ) . Many countries have tried banning cryptocurrency and failed , and in some other cases such efforts have further increased the usage of Bitcoin as a reflection of the distrust in the system by the people . Banning cryptocurrency is a lost cause , anecdotally and technologically . <p> Secondly , it is difficult to separate cryptocurrency from blockchain -- you can try , but some of the blockchain end-product might lose its core traits , like separating butter from milk . Blockchain and cryptocurrency are two sides of the same coin , blockchain is the record keeping technology , and cryptocurrency describes the information recorded -- one can imagine the difficulties in distinguishing what is legal ( blockchain ) and illegal ( crypto ) in the proposed ban . Regulatory ambiguity such as this is no friend to innovation . There is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safety of the underlying blockchain . Not to get too technical here , but much of the cherished safety trait of blockchain comes from thermal energy sunk into the chain , block after block of transaction records -- to temper the record and break the chain , one needs to input even greater energy than that which has been stored in the existing chain . Cryptocurrency provides the incentive and resource allocating mechanism for the energy sink , and without it , the blockchain itself becomes much weaker . <p> Blockchain , along with artificial intelligence and biotechnology , are the three technologies that will define the decades to come . Blockchain and cryptocurrency in particular will have deep implications beyond the traditional realm of a typical technological breakthrough . How will the said truth machine operate in this post-truth world , how will the first challenge to the nation-money marriage in a millennia look like , and how will the people prosper in a middleman-less environment ? All these questions are worth the government to think through , and without the ban ."
"<p> For instance , he never imagined being diagnosed with a language processing disorder as a child would lead to his focus on math , which led him to a master 's degree in biostatistics , which ultimately led him to pursue a combined Ph.D . at Carnegie Mellon University in engineering and public policy and in statistics and data science . <p> But he now sees the ways in which his early emphasis on STEM contributed to his methodical research habits . He knows that the increased effort he had to put toward learning to read helped him build the resilience necessary to embark upon graduate statistics classes without having studied this subject before . <p> "" It 's amazing to me how you can use data and statistics to inform policy , "" he said . "" I want to see , quantitatively , what outcomes we can expect with each policy alternative . "" <p> Policy is not Mesner 's first vocation . Initially , he wanted to join the priesthood . Such a journey seemed at odds with his identity as a gay Latino , but Mesner said , "" I wanted my life 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , the Capuchin Franciscan Seminary seemed like the road to societal influence . <p> Mesner was a bit of an outlier among the friars . In a space where most students focused on philosophy , Mesner majored in math . Amid a religious community that limited the relationships available to him as a gay man , Mesner said he broadened his intellectual habits and redefined his spiritual beliefs . "" I just learned a ton there , "" he said . "" The experience got me asking questions about myself , about church teachings , and opened my mind in a huge way . "" <p> Following a break from Catholicism , Mesner felt a bit unmoored . Still aiming to devote his work to the greater good , he decided to pursue a master 's degree in biostatistics and , in his spare time , decided to train for triathlons . Joining the DC Triathlon Club in Washington , D.C. , introduced him both to intentional , dedicated training methods and a group of multi-faceted athletes who relentlessly pursued improvement . <p> "" They were amazing people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his own achievements -- he completed his third Ironman competition during his Ph.D . coursework . These grueling races include a multi-mile swim , a bike race of over 100 miles , and end with a full marathon . <p> Training for such an event involves as much mental clarity as it does physical endurance . Lucky for Mesner , his time in seminary taught him meditation and stillness -- habits that contributed to his ability to log dozens of miles each week on top of graduate studies . <p> Once he completed his master 's , Mesner was recruited by his department chair to work for a collaborative nonprofit funded by both the Department of Defense and the National Institutes of Health . The infectious disease clinical research program taught Mesner how poignantly numbers could tell a story . <p> "" In one study , we examined military personnel living with HIV who were subsequently infected with syphilis , "" Mesner explained . The medical community was unsure how to treat an immunocompromised person with antibiotics for a syphilis infection -- what dosage was appropriate ? Which specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thousands of cases of syphilis in the US Military HIV Natural History Study , we saw no statistical significance in using a greater dosage of penicillin to treat a patient for syphilis who was also living with HIV , "" Mesner said . <p> He clarified that Centers for Disease Control guidelines already indicated this treatment protocol , but there were differing opinions among the medical community on this guideline . In fact , some doctors wrote a response questioning our findings . "" Fortunately , we were very meticulous , "" Mesner said . "" Biostatistical models help doctors make sense of large datasets . I think that 's how science should always be done . I 'm a firm believer in not bringing in your opinion about causal mechanisms to data analysis . "" <p> Studying military personnel affected by sexually transmitted disease was a paradigm-shifting opportunity for Mesner . Because the United States Military has universal healthcare for its service members , researchers like Mesner have an unparalleled data set available to them . "" I do n't know if I will ever have another data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pursues a dual Ph.D . at Carnegie Mellon , Octavio Mesner has dedicated his academic career to tackling challenges of profound societal consequence . He has been authored or co-authored at least six publications in prestigious global periodicals . Most recently , Mesner won a Ford Foundation Fellowship -- a distinguished social justice award from the National Academy of Sciences that aims to increase faculty diversity in higher education . <p> He did , however , notice a significant lack of risk behavior information prior to the repeal of the Clinton Administration 's "" do n't ask , do n't tell "" policy . The majority of the data in his syphilis study was collected prior to 2010 when the United States Armed Forces finally began to allow service members to disclose their sexual orientation and behaviors openly . <p> "" Before that point , we could n't ask patients about sexual risk behaviors . Doctors could report patients and they risked losing their livelihood . In addition to relegating an entire group of people , this policy hurt the science . It was impossible for us to fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , "" Mesner said . Nearly a decade later , the data is still skewed . "" HIV infection data is male-heavy , and it 's still taboo to talk about . "" <p> He began to look at the types of data that were missing -- statistically and epidemiologically , it matters if a gay male is the insertive or receptive partner , and this information is not often recorded . "" We do n't have an N to compare anything to when we study this population . These are downstream policy effects I wish people would think about , "" Mesner said . <p> Gradually , he became aware that he could be a person influencing policy . "" I really , really care about using data to support policy decision-making , "" he said . He discovered the field of engineering and public policy and was taken aback that his reach school , CMU , offered him a spot and encouraged him to tack on an emphasis in statistics to boot . <p> "" That was one of the happiest moments of my life other than when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he looked at the reality of the work load involved in double majoring for a Ph.D . program . <p> He fell into the "" imposter syndrome "" many CMU students experience when they first arrive at a campus burgeoning with such innovative ideas . "" When I came here , I saw that everyone here is brilliant , "" he said . "" I started to worry about why I was accepted . "" <p> Despite his concerns about his qualifications , Mesner delved into unfamiliar fields of study . He took electives in machine learning and economics and struggled , but now finds the course materials to be directly applicable to his dissertation research . <p> "" I started to think , this is like training for an Ironman , "" he said . "" If I was regimented , I could do it . "" <p> Mesner decided to work toward downstream positive effects for CMU . With the same deliberate planning he gave to his athletic training , Mesner began to explore intersectional connection opportunities for LGBTQ+ people of color . <p> "" CMQ+ asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst job , "" he said in reference to a campus organization supporting graduate students in the LGBTQ+ community . "" But I also feel like if nobody does this work , these organizations ca n't exist . "" Mesner was soon also invited to join the President 's Task Force on Campus Climate , where he engaged with people who shared his concerns . <p> For example , Mesner noticed University Health Services was not offering a specific type of test for sexually transmitted infections ( STI ) . Mesner met with Noah Riley from Health Promotion to see what could be done . <p> "" Octavio wanted to understand more about why UHS was not offering the testing , and to begin a conversation about opportunities CMU had to increase access to this type of care , "" said Riley . The testing in question requires the care of a specialist , but through the conversation Riley formed a collaborative relationship with Mesner . As Riley got to know Mesner , he observed that Mesner "" always makes sure students standing at intersecting identities are represented and heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around STI awareness and testing to capture students who would n't normally seek this type of treatment . "" Before I met Octavio , we never really had a lot of partnership or collaboration for those events , "" said Riley . "" Octavio initiated all of that . "" <p> Mesner 's relationship with the staff at UHS helped him think about university policy as a microcosm of the government policy he hopes to help shape . He said , "" At CMU , in order to be a student , you have to have health insurance . This means everyone is less likely to get sick because everyone has access to medical care . It protects the entire community . "" <p> His research aims to link numerous , seemingly unrelated variables , to hopefully protect communities , similar to the way his beloved Ironman competitions unite seemingly unrelated athletic endeavors . <p> "" I 'm trying to develop a non-parametric exploratory data analysis method where epidemiologists ( or other researchers ) can enter a data set and get back a diagram estimating what variables are causing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code in hopes of applying the method to a survey of 10,000 gay men on sexual risk behaviors and outcomes . He said , "" I think this will be particularly interesting because in 2012 , the FDA approved a drug that can significantly reduce the risk of HIV acquisition . The question now is , how does this affect sexual risk behavior like condom use ? Might we see a higher frequency of other infections ? Hopefully my work will help epidemiologists see how risk factors are related . "" <p> Citing a current example , Mesner explained that data from China showed that the novel coronavirus had a more dramatic effect on men compared to women . "" There are so many questions swirling around . Is this because men are more likely to smoke and this is a respiratory infection ? Are there differences in the immune systems of the sick patients ? Having a more robust data analysis tool will give us places to look . "" <p> The combination of statistics and data science with engineering and public policy at CMU has given Mesner the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ datasets with this hope of informing further research and policy . He graduates in July , when he will move on to a post-doctoral fellowship in statistics at the University of Michigan . <p> "" I want to contribute to policy that supports all the diverse groups throughout this country , "" he said . "" It makes me feel so good to be part of science that supports people . "" <p> CMU grad students participate in PRIDE events annually . Pictured is the Allies Grad group from 2018 with Mesner to the left of the banner . <p> Mesner says his partner , Antoine Brantley ( L ) , is his best friend and greatest supporter as Mesner works to finish graduate school . <p> The 2017 Maryland Ironman was Mesner 's third of these grueling competitions . He finished with a time of 11:19:31 . <p> Mesner first attempted a triathlon in 2011 and found he loved the combination of events more than he enjoyed them individually .

Humans are actually not able to do this task , "" Arntfield said . <p> "" We believe , or we 're hopeful , that at the pixel level , at a level that exceeds human vision and human cognition , that the machine will actually detect a pattern in all of that noise .

"<h> The AI way to cleaner air for smart cities <p> A 2016 photo showing Dr Erik Velasco from the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology ( Smart ) , with portable scientific air quality sensors he used in a study on air pollution at bus stops . <p> BT FILE PHOTO <p> THE prospects look promising for the deployment of artificial intelligence ( AI ) in the quest for a clean and liveable environment in urban settings . The use of deep technology and innovation such as AI is one area where Singapore can excel while also being the ideal test bed for such experimentation . <p> One of the salient points in Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat 's recent Budget 2019 speech was the emphasis on a smart , green and liveable city . In particular , the Budget makes specific reference to "" emissions abatement "" . <p> The government expects to collect carbon tax revenues of nearly S$1 billion in the first five years of its implementation . But , and more importantly , it is also prepared to spend an amount more than tax revenue collected "" to support worthwhile projects which deliver the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Particulate matter ( PM ) , many of which are hazardous , refers to the sum of all solid and liquid particles suspended in air . This includes organic and inorganic particles , such as dust , pollen , soot ( "" black carbon "" ) , smoke and liquid droplets . <p> PM-induced pollution can result in chronic bronchitis or asthma and premature deaths as a result of cardiovascular problems or a stroke . PM2.5 , for example , are inhalable pollutant particles measuring 2.5 microns and smaller in diameter - about a 30th the diameter of a human hair . These ultrafine particles are perilous because they can lead to a variety of health issues such as reduced lung function . Some may even be absorbed into the bloodstream . <p> The economic cost of particulate air pollution on health in Singapore is substantial . An earlier study conducted by economists Euston Quah and Wai-Mun Chia estimated the total health costs associated with particulate matter in the air at US$3.75 billion or about 2.04 per cent of Singapore 's GDP in 2009 . <p> Vehicles represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other tailpipe pollutants , such as carbon monoxide , hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides . According to data by the World Health Organisation , 92 per cent of the world 's population live in places where air quality levels exceed WHO limits , resulting in millions of deaths every year . In 2012 , 6.5 million deaths ( or 11.6 per cent of all global deaths ) were associated with indoor and outdoor air pollution according to WHO estimates . <p> While more cities are now vigorously monitoring air pollution , comprehensive and actionable baseline data for monitoring progress in combatting it are not always available . Measurements are often done selectively based on a limited number of measurement stations . <p> This makes it difficult to get reliable and valid environmental data , for example , about the sources of contaminants that could inform better policy-making for greener cities on the basis of real 24/7 insights . Reducing harmful emissions and clean air predictions require precise , intelligent and actionable measurement systems . <p> This is a pain point that can be addressed by harnessing the power of sensor technologies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Through the computation of real-time IoT sensor data ( with detailed spatial and temporal pollutant measurements ) obtained from various sources such as ground-based sensor units and commercial satellites , user-friendly air quality heat maps and executive dashboards can be created ( such as with the help of machine learning algorithms for predictive modelling ) to determine the most severe pollution hotspots in order to take proactive steps towards further decarbonising the economy . <p> Examples of important use cases include tackling specific areas with higher concentrations of pollutants or leveraging ( anonymous ) crowd-sourced sensor data from cell phones to localise parts of the city which are harmful , with the aim of reducing one 's own exposure to PM . Entrepreneurs keen to monetise air pollution data are well advised to do so on the basis of a digitalised business model that uses AI algorithms for creating green(er) and ( more ) liveable cities with better air quality via real-time assessment and management of outdoor air . <p> To stay ahead in the smart city race in an era of AI-enabled smart ( urban ) solutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight against air pollution should possess basic AI know-how and know-why , over and above their expertise and experience in developing land use plans , revitalising urban precincts , making infrastructure services more accessible to disadvantaged segments of the population or creating a scalable business model . <p> Smart city development programmes will have to be quickly rebooted with an AI advantage in order to leverage new digital technologies , big-data analytics , and cloud computing for cleaner air and better public health . AI is arguably the new frontier of instrumented , environmentally-friendly smart city initiatives . <p> AI-powered computer vision analytics with facial detection systems , in combination with environmental sensors mounted on smart lamp posts , for example , could enable authorities to identify in real time where exactly air pollution occurs , who is causing it , and where remedial and preventive action is required . <p> As these systems are able to index faces to determine gender , race and age , as well as perform facial matching against databases , rule violations may become a thing of the past provided the ethics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Current technological advances in the area of AI-enabled smart city systems suggest that intelligent air quality management systems may soon become fully autonomous in making decisions , for example , remotely turning off the ( combustion ) engine of a self-driving car which is polluting the environment . <p> The possibilities of smart , AI-enabled "" emissions abatements "" are indeed endless . Singapore should seek a first-mover advantage through large-scale deployment . The demand for clean , green , and liveable cities is growing in tandem with the deep concern over climate change and how it intimately affects the health of people and the living environment . <p> Emission abatements will require companies to respond to this massive societal challenge in a purposeful manner . It is also the ethical and socially responsible thing to do with significant benefits beyond the health outcomes and economic well-being . Companies have to reduce their environmental footprint , with governments and consumers requiring they do more to account for the negative externalities their business activities generate . <p> AI-powered emissions abatement can be a powerful lever towards an empirically-based targeted approach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can and should exploit this window of opportunity to be a policy- and thought-leader in emissions abatement while spawning technological innovations to power the environmental drive . <p> The writers are from Singapore Management University ( SMU ) .

"<p> A conference here to gather American business and military experts to discuss the coming revolution in artificial intelligence was a good Election Day measure of the challenges ahead to maintain the U.S. competitive edge . <p> Corporate and government leaders agree that China 's rapid application of AI to business and military problems should be a "" Sputnik moment "" to propel change in America . As a top-down command economy , China is directing money and its best brains to develop the smart systems that will operate cars , planes , offices and information -- along with the transformation of warfare . <p> The United States is struggling to respond to this world-changing challenge . What 's underway is frail and exists mostly on paper . Congress this year passed legislation calling for a national AI commission , but so far it 's just a concept . The Pentagon in June established a new Joint Artificial Intelligence Center that will spend $1.75 billion over six years , but critics fear it will be far short of what 's needed . <p> "" There is no quarterback "" for AI , says Amy Webb , author of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top U.S. and Chinese AI companies . The United States started with a technology lead , but U.S. efforts are dispersed and decentralized . Companies have trouble sharing the structured data that machines can learn on . <p> "" China is the OPEC of data , "" argues Webb . In a totalitarian society , every human and social interaction feeds a vast pool of structured data for machines to ingest . The Chinese government can then commandeer companies and people , as needed . <p> America may need an "" AI czar , "" argues Ashton B. Carter , former secretary of defense for President Barack Obama . That 's because no current agency or White House office is empowered to coordinate an effort as complicated as the Manhattan Project , which built a nuclear weapon , or the "" space race "" that put a man on the moon . But mobilizing resources in this way requires political vision and leadership , which are lacking today in both parties . <p> "" China has a national strategy and is executing it . That 's what 's missing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scharre , who studies AI at the Center for a New American Security . "" It has to be a national effort , especially in terms of talent management , "" agrees Robert Work , a former deputy secretary of defense . <p> Work argues that a good start would be an AI "" training corps , "" a bit like the National Guard . The Pentagon would pay for advanced technical education in exchange for two days a month of training with government systems and two weeks a year for major exercises . Members of the corps could keep their regular jobs at Microsoft or Google , say , but might be called up in a national emergency . <p> An awkward problem for America now is that the employees of the biggest and best AI companies seem reluctant to work with the U.S. government . After the Edward Snowden revelations , tech companies and their employees got nervous about appearing too cooperative with government intelligence programs . For example , when Google this year agreed to help the Pentagon develop battlefield algorithms in "" Project Maven , "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to back out . <p> Microsoft bravely announced last month that it would sell advanced technologies needed "" to build a strong defense "" to military and intelligence agencies . But there 's still a culture clash between Silicon Valley software engineers , many of whom see themselves as libertarian members of a global community , and defense planners , whose overriding priority is to build systems that assure American dominance in any future conflict . <p> We can see all our national strengths and weaknesses in the AI debate : a smart , dynamic private sector ( on display here at the "" Time Machine 2018 "" conference , sponsored by SparkCognition ) but weak public leadership ; proud military services that unfortunately are tied to legacy weapons systems such as manned fighter jets and giant aircraft carriers ; a public education system that does n't prepare students well for the tech jobs that matter ; a broken immigration policy that does n't serve our economic needs . <p> After the midterm elections , the country will begin a heated debate about the best candidate to lead the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders is to ask how they would meet the AI challenge of refashioning our economic and strategic foundations . A bitterly divided country with a dysfunctional political system is n't going to win the race anywhere , except down . <p> Ask yourself who could lead a national push to capture the high ground of technology , and you may come up with the name of the man or woman who should be our next president ."

"<h> Pursuit home <h> Thriving amid the rise of the machines <p> Since 1948 , futurists have warned about the impact automation could have on the human workforce , and now those changes are becoming a reality . Does it mean a re-think about what jobs humans can do better than machines ? <p> By Garry Barker , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Technology is destroying jobs , says Dr Greg Adamson , an expert in the social impact of advanced technology . There can no longer be any doubt about that hard fact of life in the 21st Century . The process is now inevitable , as automation , robotics and artificial intelligence embeds deeper into our society . <p> But with robots and automation proliferating -- and with traditional jobs disappearing -- the primary reaction from politicians , the media and wider industry has so far been one of denial , according to Dr Adamson of the University of Melbourne 's Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering . <p> "" Even the best scholars in the field put artificially happy messages at the end of their books or their articles , although anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evidence set out in the text . "" <p> Robotic arms work on the bodyparts of cars as they pass along a section of automated production line . Picture : Getty Images <h> THE FUTURE IS COMING <p> There is no consensus on the timeline covering the demise of traditional work , but Dr Adamson puts what might be called the ultimate period between 2025 and 2035 . <p> "" That 's when you will see a complete transformation of the face of work , "" he says . <p> That this was coming has been known at least since 1948 when Norbert Wiener , a distinguished American mathematician and philosopher , proposed that work had no future , Dr Adamson recounts . Business and labour unions accepted his view but said it was too far away to think about . <p> Seventy years on , the process is now accelerating : technology powering robots , digital processes , and automation of banking , checkouts and even manual tasks , like stacking shelves in a warehouse using radio beacons and bar code , is increasingly common .

In the Melbourne School of Design , architect and lecturer Dr Alberto Pugnale leads a team that is working on the use of drones in building .

Now they and the engineers are coming together . "" <p> And it 's engineering that is responsible for making all the changes occurring now and accelerating into the future , says Dr Adamson . <p> "" So those engineering positions will remain critically important . However , every time you get a new generation of technology coming along , it is designed to minimise the number of people needed to support it . "" <p> That , he says , produces a tussle between jobs disappearing and jobs emerging .

"<p> At the core of Microsoft 's drawing bot is a technology known as a generative adversarial network , or GAN . Photo : iStockphoto <p> Washington : Microsoft researchers are developing an artificial intelligence ( AI ) enabled ' drawing bot ' that can create images from text descriptions of an object .

"<h> Engineering a more responsible digital future <p> The world is being battered by technological disruption , as innovations such as big data analytics , artificial intelligence ( AI ) , robotics , the Internet of Things , blockchain , 3D printing , and virtual reality change how societies and economies work . Individually , each of these technologies has the potential to transform established products , services , and associated support networks . Taken together , they will upend old business models and institutions , heralding a new era of economic , social , and political history . How will we respond ? <p> Major economic transformations typically produce far-reaching change . During the first Industrial Revolution , in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , new manufacturing processes eventually led to huge improvements in human wellbeing . As productivity increased , salaries and living standards rose . But , early in the process , mechanization brought negative consequences , like unemployment , child labor , and environmental degradation . <p> The social and political impact of the digital revolution could be even more dramatic . Wars and revolutions may erupt , and values like human rights and civil liberties could be undermined . As my colleagues and I noted in a recent article in Scientific American , the more computers know about us , "" the less likely our choices are to be free and not predetermined by others "" -- as long as informational self-determination is impossible . <p> Fortunately , the loss of individual autonomy is not inevitable . It is possible to engineer a more responsible digital future . But we must start doing so immediately . Success requires public discourse , digital enlightenment and emancipation , and broader awareness of technology 's risks . In other words , the transition we are facing is bigger than any one country or organization can manage alone . We all have something at stake : our future . <p> There are obvious dangers in letting technological progress alone drive this change . In 2008 , Wired editor Chris Anderson suggested that big data would eventually reveal all truth , without requiring science or theory . Clearly , that has n't happened . With more data at their disposal , scientists find more patterns to study ; it takes science to judge which are meaningful and which are misleading . The expectation that AI would overcome human weaknesses such as bias has also fallen short . Today , many AI systems discriminate against people , and can even be manipulated . <p> Other predictions of the new "" digital society "" were equally off-base . So-called smart cities -- in which urban life is automated -- have so far failed to live up to expectations . That 's because cities are not simply giant supply chains ; they are also spaces for experimentation , creativity , innovation , learning , and interaction . <p> Finally , while the "" platform economy "" , and its reliance on the Internet , computation , and data , has given rise to some of the most valuable companies in the world , it has also turned many citizens into passive consumers . The irony of hyper-connectivity is that people are less discerning not only about the products they buy , but also with the information they consume . It is , after all , this "" attention economy "" that spawned "" fake news "" . <p> Simply put , our digital utopia will not arrive unaided . We need a more ethical approach to engineering technology , one that integrates constitutional , cultural , and moral norms and values into artificial and autonomous systems . An "" ethically aligned "" , "" value-sensitive "" design approach is needed in every aspect of technological development -- from smart devices to the software that supports our governments and markets . <p> For example , if democracy is to remain a viable political model , the information systems that democratic governments use must be designed to support human rights , dignity , self-determination , pluralism , division of responsibility , transparency , fairness , and justice . <p> To achieve this democratic digital future , the world needs to change how it thinks about technology . We need to build open , participatory information ecosystems that empower anyone in the global economy to contribute ideas , talent , and resources . In a networked world , where everything we do affects others , we must learn to think beyond ourselves , and pursue cooperation , co-creation , co-evolution , and collective intelligence . <p> If we progress accordingly , the Fourth Industrial Revolution can be more inclusive than the first ; that is the future that my colleagues and I are working toward . For example , at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands , we are engineering socially responsible communication networks and urban governance systems , while the FuturICT initiative , an international network of researchers , is applying a multidisciplinary approach to technology development . The goal of both research efforts is to facilitate a more equitable digital future . <p> We have the ability to engineer technology that serves us , rather than enslaves us . But building that future demands a new digital zeitgeist , whereby social , cultural , environmental , and ethical values become part of the design process . Innovations and revolutions are often upsetting and tumultuous , but in the digital age , they can also be responsible ."

"<h> New AI research makes it easier to create fake footage of someone speaking <h> Although the scientists behind it would really rather you did n't <p> An aspect of artificial intelligence that 's sometimes overlooked is just how good it is at creating fake audio and video that 's difficult to distinguish from reality . The advent of Photoshop got us doubting our eyes , but what happens when we ca n't rely on our other senses ? <p> The latest example of AI 's audiovisual magic comes from the University of Washington , where researchers have created a new tool that takes audio files , converts them into realistic mouth movements , and then grafts those movements onto existing video . The end-result is a video of someone saying something they did n't . ( Not at the time , anyway . ) It 's a confusing process to understand by just reading about it , so take a look at the video below : <p> You can see two side-by-side clips of Barack Obama . The one on the left is the source for the audio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different speech , with the researchers ' algorithms use to graft new mouth shapes onto the footage . The resulting video is n't perfect ( Obama 's mouth movements are a little blurry -- a common problem with AI-generated imagery ) but overall it 's pretty convincing . <p> The researchers said they used Obama as a test subject for this work because high-quality video footage of the former president is plentiful , which makes training the neural networks easier . Seventeen hours of footage were needed as data to track and replicate his mouth movements , researcher Ira Kemelmacher told The Verge over email , but in future this training constraint could be reduced to just an hour . <p> The researchers say their tech could be used to improve Skype calls <p> The team behind the work say they hope it could be used to improve video chat tools like Skype . Users could collect footage of themselves speaking , use to train the software , and then when they need to talk to someone , video on their side would be generated automatically using just their voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection is shaky , or if they 're trying to save mobile data . <p> The team from the University of Washington is understandably keen to distance themselves from these sorts of uses , and make it clear they only trained their neural nets on Obama 's voice and video . ( "" You ca n't just take anyone 's voice and turn it into an Obama video , "" said professor Steve Seitz in a press release . "" We very consciously decided against going down the path of putting other people 's words into someone 's mouth . "" ) But in theory , this tech could be used to map anyone 's voice onto anyone 's face , will everyone be so scrupulous if the technology becomes widespread ? <p> You can check a more detailed video of the neural nets in action below :"

"<h> Apple Ratings is coming to iOS 14 , how disruptive will it be ? <h> The company may use device location to ensure review integrity . <p> Apple Maps currently relies on Yelp and TripAdvisor for local business reviews and related content such as images . That could begin to change with iOS 14 ; the question is : how disruptive will it be for Apple 's partners and the "" review economy "" in general ? <p> First reported by 9to5Mac , based on this tweet , iOS 14 will allow users to add photos and rate a business natively within Apple Maps . It differentiates between products and services and uses a binary thumbs up or down system like Facebook , rather than a point or star-ratings system like Google . <p> Reviews too important to outsource . Ratings and reviews , like Maps themselves are ultimately too important , to be outsourced even to strong third party platforms like TripAdvisor and Yelp . That would now appear be Apple 's thinking . <p> As discussed in this post from Mike Blumenthal featuring Aaron Weiche and David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The market will see this as bad news for Apple 's partners and their valuations could be impacted in the short term . <p> However , we do n't know what the contracts say or how long Apple will be collecting ratings before it feels confident enough to "" go it alone . "" It could be quite some time and so the actual impact on Yelp or TripAdvisor in the short term could therefore be minimal . Stay tuned . <p> Apple Ratings and Photos UI <p> Source : @BeauGiles <p> Preventing fake reviews . The most interesting part of Apple Ratings is the company 's apparent effort to prevent review fraud . According to 9to5Mac , "" Apple is using on-device machine learning to present POI rating opportunities when it sees that someone has visited a place several times . The company will also be doing some checks to try and prevent abuse , such as only accepting ratings from people that have physically visited the place . "" <p> It 's not clear whether this is an accurate description of Apple 's Ratings methodology . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some sort of "" critical mass . "" However , it could also be disruptive of the review economy in a very positive way . <p> The problem of review fraud is much more extensive than people realize . It 's rampant on Amazon and Google , in the millions of reviews annually . The problem does n't spare any of the major platforms and also exists on TripAdvisor and Yelp , although they apparently do a better job of cleaning up fake reviews . Consumers have an increasing but still only limited awareness of the problem . <p> Building trust with users . Apple Maps has millions of users globally and generates billions of local searches . But whatever Apple says about its position on the iPhone , it lags far behind Google Maps in usage and utility overall . Google Maps is the epicenter of local search . <p> Developing and presenting its Ratings as more accurate and free of fraud could help differentiate Apple Maps as a local search platform in the future . I exchanged emails about Apple Ratings with Curtis Boyd whose company Objection.co @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , "" Apple has the benefit of starting from scratch and learning from the mistakes of Yelp and Google . "" He added that Apple could use multiple signals to determine ratings authenticity including location . "" Access to some of the OS/hardware data would provide countless data points for AI to examine in order to determine review validity . "" <p> Why we care . We 'll need to wait for the official launch of Apple Ratings . But if Apple does emphasize trust and accuracy using visitation and other signals , it could put meaningful pressure on other platforms to do more to clean up review spam on their sites . This would be a welcome development across the board . <p> Local SEOs ( and reputation management vendors ) would now appear to have another review platform to address .

"<p> Led by Brutes baring sharp teeth and wielding gravity hammers , the Banished are one of the Halo universe 's most imposing factions . Introduced in 2017 as the antagonists of Halo Wars 2 , they 're a splinter group of ex-Covenant warriors dedicated to clawing out a mercenary criminal empire . And that mission seems to continue in Halo Infinite . <p> "" The hour approaches . Our forces occupy the ring . Within hours , it 'll be under our control . Humanity will burn . Their brazen defiance will be all but a memory . No more prophets , no more lies . We stand together . Brothers to the end . We are his will , we are his legacy , we are the Banished , "" said the ominous voice in a recording that 's likely an in-universe transmission . <p> Not much is known yet about Halo Infinite . A trailer released at E3 2019 showed the Master Chief waking up to fight in yet another galactic crisis , this one seemingly set on a high-definition forested world not unlike the very first Halo ring . But what role will the Banished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Banished ? <p> The first three games in the Halo series centered on the fight between humanity and the Covenant , a violent religious faction of aliens who , unfortunately , happened to be humanity 's first contact with the rest of the galaxy 's species . By Halo 4 , the Covenant had been defeated , and while the story moved in another direction , the aliens kept making military and political shifts in the background . It was in the chaos that Atriox , a powerful former Covenant warrior who left in disgrace to become a mercenary , rose to power . <p> After the Covenant fell in Halo 3 , the Banished took advantage of the power vacuum and became a stronger military force . The group is mostly made up of Atriox 's Jiralhanae species , known by humanity ( and labeled in the game ) as Brutes . Anyone can join the Banished if they prove their use as a mercenary , though , so Elites , other ex-Covenant species , and even humans make up some of their ranks . Thirsty for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes on the most dangerous weapons in the Halo galaxy , including the parasitic Flood . <p> The Banished have attacked both what 's left of the Covenant and humanity , and threaten , destroy , or enslave others . To that end , the aforementioned transmission for Halo Infinite teases that they have now taken control of a Halo ring , a superweapon capable of wiping out organic life across the galaxy as well as unleashing the parasitic Flood , a scourge that assimilates any lifeform it can . <p> The ring in question may be Installation 09 , a newly-minted weaponized ringworld , created in Halo Wars 2 by the crew of the stranded UNSC ship Spirit of Fire as a way to relay a message back to humanity . At the end of the game , the new Halo ring enters slipspace and is heading towards the location of the original Halo ring , Installation 04 ( or Alpha Halo ) , when it 's intercepted by one of the giant Guardians introduced in Halo 5 : Guardians . Did Atriox and the rest of his Banished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another possibility is that Atriox used the Ark , the massive mechanical breeding ground for Halo rings where Halo Wars 2 is set , to create yet another superweapon with which to dispose of his enemies . The one thing we do know is that the Halo Infinite announcement trailer confirmed that the next game would take place ( at least in part ) on a new ring . <p> Ad -- content continues below <h> Why Use the Banished ? <p> After the Covenant fell , the Halo universe needed new villains for new stories . Several new factions have cropped up to fill the void left behind by the Covenant , including the ancient Prometheans , which in Halo 5 were taken over by the Created , a wild card artificial intelligence liberation faction run by Master Chief 's closest companion turned villain , Cortana . Since the end of Halo Wars 2 teased one of the Created 's Guardians intercepting the new Halo ring , it 's possible that Cortana and her robot army will play a major role in the new game . But if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Created , the game might work out better in the long run . <p> Placing the Banished in the main villain role would give the Master Chief plenty of aliens to fight , freeing up the Created to be either the emotional heart of the story or a threat in the background . Many long-time fans were disappointed by the ending of Halo 5 , which sees a "" rampant "" Cortana launch a campaign to take over the galaxy . Criticisms included the poor portrayal of mental illness ( Cortana 's story was coded to look like a mental breakdown ) , the vilification of a beloved hero character , and the new enemies simply not being much fun to fight .

"<p> &gt;With vehicle connectivity becoming the next hot topic in the world of technology and innovation , NASSCOM Centre of Excellence partnered with Telematics Wire and organised the fifth edition of India 's biggest summit of connected vehicles in Bengaluru -- The Connected Vehicles 2020 . <p> With more than ten connected vehicles on display , and over 1200 delegates from different domains , the summit aimed to bring the real essence of connected vehicles in the country . <p> On a three day session , numerous speakers driving the automobile and technology industry extensively shared their views on spearheading an Intelligent Transportation System in the country which , in recent years has seen massive growth in the connected vehicles space along with the development of telematics at a rapid pace . With the presence of high-speed internet connectivity and smartphone integration via applications , the adoption of telematics among users has been on the rise . <p> In the summit , one of the most talked subjects remained the adoption of AIS-140 which has been made mandatory by the government , i.e. , the capability of tracking vehicles and the availability of emergency buttons in the vehicle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moving forward , the summit also focused on the government 's mandatory plan to adopt the advanced driver assistance system ( ADAS ) in every vehicle by the year 2022 . It encouraged manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers ( OEM ) to step up and come in full support . <h> Connected , Clean &amp; Smart -- The Backbone Of Future Mobility <p> Diego Graffi , CEO &amp; MD of Piaggio Vehicles Private Limited said , "" There are several benefits related to connected vehicles , such as helping authorities to understand traffic flow , to help understand drivers the traffic build-ups , and the breakdowns of accidents . The problems to these solutions can be only brought by an ecosystem which is fully connected . "" <p> Graffi further demonstrated the latest app interference which is capable of hosting information to keep a driver connected to the vehicle such as state of charge , distance to empty , vehicle balance , number of batteries available at the nearest station with a strong emphasis on moving to electric vehicles with swapping battery system . <p> On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the logistics business through the use of advanced telematics in the trucks manufactured by Eicher .

In short , ensuring that long hauls vehicles reach their destinations in the shortest possible time frame . <h> V2X &amp; IoT solutions <p> Amongst many innovative ideas , V2X earned limelight by enabling a vehicle connecting to another process and taking the next necessary steps . Maneesh Prasad , CEO of Telematics Wire , explained , "" It is not like every vehicle will talk to every vehicle . The vehicles will talk with another vehicle that is in the proximity of 300 meters which is a fairly good distance . For example , if there is a crossing without traffic signals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "" To make V2X turn into a reality , DSRC or dedicated short-range communication along with 5G is likely to bring down the latency to a satisfactory extent and allow the vehicle to communicate within the needed time frame . <p> Moving forward , a lot is riding on M2M and IoT devices as several system designs , and software development services are coming into picture for IoT Node and gateways . IoT clouds are being designed to collect data from POS , wearable devices , connected conventional as well as electric cars , IoT gateways and sensors to provide analytics and insights along with management of devices . <h> Threat Protect &amp; Smart Security <p> The amount of data that connected vehicles are likely to generate , the security of vehicles was a concern on everyone 's mind from the industry . However , smart and intelligent analytics platforms are being developed that will monitor a vehicle 's ecosystem to keep continuous surveillance along with risk management and vulnerability assessment . The systems will keep a check on different kinds of threats such as CAN attack , network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , DB injection and keyfob attack in various sections of a vehicle such as telematics ECU , battery management system , gateway ECU and RKE . <p> Not just four-wheelers but AI-powered two-wheelers such as the Revolt RV400 can also receive a number of attacks in the form of electromagnetic fault injections , GPS spoofing and immobiliser attack to point a few . Adding to the concern , Prasad says , "" The industry is working continuously keeping the kind of threats in the picture . On the government 's front , TED or transport engineering division is working on various standards related to automotive cybersecurity . <p> Data ownership is another bottleneck that needs to be overcome since a big data is supposed to be generated and who should hold that data remains a debate . Not to mention , who is likely to respond or should be made responsible in case of a data breach is another segment to look at .

In modern business practices , the software serves as a platform where huge workloads can be easily be managed by organisations . The recent meetup hosted by Qubole , together with co-hosts Twitter and Astronomer , was held at their Bangalore office on Feb 8th , 2020 -- it represented the first Apache Airflow meetup , where the speakers shed light into a few important topics and updates on the popular software , Apache Airflow . <p> From understanding platform insights on achieving high scale using Airflow to how Qubole is utilising its data using Airflow , this meet up went beyond and above . The meetup was overflowed with more than 100 attendees and witnessed a considerable amount audience from the Airflow community . <p> Due to several benefits such as modular architecture , extensibility , being dynamic in nature , etc. , several popular organisations like Twitter and Netflix , have started adopting this software into their platforms . Qubole have been working on Airflow for a few years now . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startup , Astronomer has raised $5.7 million in seed funding to deliver enterprise-grade Apache Airflow . <p> There were a total of four talks where the discussions mainly centred on how Apache Airflow portrays a vital role in organisations when it comes to monitoring workflows . The talks were delivered by industry data experts that included , Kaxil Naik , an Apache Airflow PMC Member &amp; Core Committer , and a Senior Data Engineer at Astronomer ; Raman Gupta , a Senior Computer Scientist at Adobe ; Devjyoti Patra of Qubole ; and Sumit Maheshwari , Apache Airflow PMC &amp; Tech Lead at Twitter . <h> Talk 1 : Airflow Best Practices &amp; Roadmap to 2.0 <p> This talk was delivered by Kaxil Naik from Astronomer . In this talk , Naik spoke about various intuitive features of Airflow version 1.10.8 which have been updated along with some bug fixes , a few interesting tips for writing Directed Acyclic Graphs ( DAGs ) as well as the upcoming upgrades in Airflow 2.0 . <p> Some of the new features discussed are mentioned below <p> Addition of tags to DAGs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add DAG Run view <p> Allowing externally triggered DAGs to run for future exec dates <p> Updating documentation . <p> Center DAG on graph view load . <p> Next , Naik shared some of the tips and tricks for writing DAGs in order to reduce the redundancies and improve the way to write DAGs . Some of them are mentioned below . <p> DAGs as Context Manager : DAGs can be used as context managers to assign new operators to DAG automatically . <p> Default Arguments : In Airflow 1.10.8 , one can use defaultargs to avoid repeating arguments . For instance , If a dictionary of defaultargs is passed to a DAG , it will apply them to any of its operators . This makes it easy to apply a common parameter to many operators without having to type it many times . <p> Using the list to task dependencies . <p> Restrict the number of Airflow variables in the DAG . <p> Avoid code outside of an operator in DAG files <p> Use Flask-App builder based UI . <p> Set configs using environment variables . <p> Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "" <p> Lastly , Naik also discussed some of the enhancements and the roadmap to 2.0 ; some of them are mentioned below . <p> This talk was delivered by Raman Gupta , who is the Senior Computer Scientist at Adobe . In this talk , Gupta discussed how the Platform Orchestration Service at Adobe is utilising AirFlow to fulfil the need of workflow management system . He also discussed the APIs exposed to its users to manage workflows as well as the challenges faced by them and steps to overcome them . <p> Some of the key challenges faced are mentioned below : <p> To run 1000 tasks concurrently . <p> To keep scheduling latency within some predefined threshold . <p> To improve service usage or debugging experience . <p> Then , Gupta talked about some of the steps which are being taken to achieve high-scale with latency , as mentioned below : <p> Support for multiple Airflow cluster behind Orchestration service . This will also restrict the number of workflows per cluster to control . <p> Scalability such as support for multi-cluster in Orchestration service , Airflow setup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reschedule mode to achieve high concurrency . <h> Talk 3 : How Qubole Dog Food Its Own Data Using Airflow ? <p> The speaker of this talk was Devjyoti Patra from Qubole . In this talk , Patra gave an overview of the Qubole unified data platform , and he showed how to create an Airflow cluster easily just by using the console . He then discussed the ETL workflow orchestration and some of the use-cases at Qubole where Airflow is being used . For instance , Qubole has BiFrost Pipeline for sharing data with clients , run multiple pipelines for billing , insights , alerts and reports , validating the output data from upstream pipelines , among others . <h> Talk 4 : WTF is PEX &amp; How Twitter Uses it to Deploy Airflow <p> This was the last talk for the event which was initiated by Sumit Maheshwari , Apache Airflow PMC &amp; Tech Lead at Twitter . In this talk , Sumit discussed what PEX or Python executables are , and how it is similar to . exe files . He also discussed Python ANTS or PANTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to use it to build Airflow.pex file . Lastly , The speaker discussed a few points on how to deploy Airflow on Kubernetes . Some of the points mentioned are as follows <p> Bundle airflow.pex file into docker image on top of a python-based image . <p> Supply Airflow configs via Kubernetes Config map <p> Write/Read task logs from GCS . <p> Outlook <p> With the conclusion of the meetup , the audience learnt a lot about the Apache Airflow as well as a few tips and tricks on how to use this software with ease . Some of the key takeaways are mentioned below . <p> &gt;Third Edition Of MachineCon Announced , India 's Most Powerful Gathering Of Analytics Leadershttps : **32;4852;TOOLONG ...

A lot of friends that I know are already here and its great to interact with them and a lot of the young women professionals . It 's been a great experience and I am looking forward to next year . <p> I think it 's an excellent idea to have this conference because data science is the area where we need more women . Data science is the upcoming field right and the future is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to have this initiative and there are so many women already who are successful in the other sites and I hope we can have more women . So , we really need the women to also embrace this new technology . <p> Vikram VijSr . Vice President atSamsung R&amp;D Institute <p> I think it 's amazing it 's great to see so many women leaders coming especially in analytics area .

So , I think Rising has provided a very good platform for women to come and develop the network of women analytics leaders . So , kudos to the team of Rising for building this platform and I 'm sure that there is a long way to go . <p> I have never had been to the occasion like this and on women 's day especially . I actually avoid going to an event because its is very stereotyped and I really hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an endangered species or something , so I really do nt like it , but this is a different gathering . I think people working in this industry coming will give a lot of new perspectives . I think it 's a great event <p> Sohini MehtaHead -- Global Delivery and Competency development for Data , Analytics and AI at Wipro Ltd . <p> I really wanted to come to rising because of Analytics India Magazine . You featured us not because we were women but based on our product and that 's what we 've always Bank towards . I do think you should have many more of these conference on very specialized topics .

"<h> AI predicts Oscar winners -- but betting sites do it better <h> Story by <p> You do n't normally need to be a fortune teller to predict the Oscar winners , but the Academy has sprung a few surprises in recent years . Last night , a team of data scientists tested whether their machine learning model could outsmart the bookmakers -- with mixed results . <p> The boffins behind the BigML machine learning platform made their predictions with a Deepnets model , an optimised implementation of the Deep Neural Networks supervised learning technique . <p> They first identified the factors that were the best predictors of a winner . In the best picture category , for example , these included the film 's synopsis ; its nominations for BAFTA , Critic 's Choice , Online Film TV Association , Golden Globes , and LA Film Critics Association awards ; and any prizes it received at the Online Film Critics Society . The model then analyzed these data points to calculate a final probability score of each nominee winning <p> The results suggest the BigML crystal ball might need a polish before it can claim clairvoyance -- although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight award-winners . <p> Its biggest miss was in the hotly-contested best picture category . The model correctly rejected the bookie 's favourite , 1917 , to pick an outsider . But it ultimately went for the wrong one , plumping for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood ahead of surprise winner Parasite . <p> The South Korean genre-bender is the latest in a string of underdogs to have pipped the frontrunners to the prize , from Moonlight 's 2016 upset to The Shape of Water the next year and Green Book in 2018 . Prior to this run of upsets , the bookmakers ' favorite had won the award six years in a row . The BigML team can therefore take some solace from recognizing that the trend for outsiders scooping the top prize would continue , even though the prediction was wrong . It also missed the second big surprise of the night : Bong Joon-ho winning the best director Oscar for Parasite . <p> Its final failure was predicting that The Irishman would win best adapted screenplay -- the only time that the bookmakers ' odds proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parasite 's best original screenplay nod , after calculating that the other nominees would make historically weak selections for the award . <p> It also correctly picked all the winners of the four acting awards -- but as Joaquin Phoenix , Renee Zellweger , Brad Pitt and Laura Dern had all already won the prizes at Oscar precursor shows including the Golden Globes , SAG , and Critics ' Choice , they were rather obvious choices . <p> For now , fortune tellers can breathe a sigh of relief that theirs is one job that wo n't be replaced by AI just yet . But with a little bit of fine-tuning before next year 's Oscars , they might not feel so secure ."
"<h> It 's time to take care of our clogged data plumbing <p> I 've been researching big data and analytics for well over a decade , and my focus has generally been on the business opportunities provided by this amazing resource . How can big data and analytics transform marketing , finance , human resources , product development , and so forth ? How can companies compete more effectively with these tools ? <p> This focus on opportunity is tantalizing , but every so often you have to look under the covers at what makes these stirring accomplishments possible . That 's the situation we are in today with big data . <p> The difficulty of extracting and integrating data from a variety of big data sources has become an issue that organizations can not ignore . <p> It 's the dirty little secret of business analytics -- that it often takes more energy to extract , clean , and integrate the data ( what a recent New York Times article called the "" janitor work , "" a fine analogy , but I prefer "" plumbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was n't that easy to pull together the necessary data environment even for small data . But with big data -- which involves data from multiple sources , each of which has problematic attributes -- that problem has become the elephant in the room . <p> In fact , I think that all this data preparation plumbing activity is a leading cause of the lack of sophisticated analytics on big data , the "" big data = small math "" phenomenon that I and others have observed . There often is n't enough time or energy left to analyze the data with advanced analytics after doing all the janitorial work . <p> At times like this , organizations need to devote energy not only to big data opportunity , but also to improving the plumbing . Our data pipes are clogged , and they 're preventing the water of business opportunity from flowing . Data scientists could be helping to cure cancer , or at least traffic jams , and they are spending all of their time removing outliers , matching up keys , and dealing with missing data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing number of new tools to speed up the productivity and effectiveness of data plumbing . Powerful methods such as machine learning that speed up analytics can also speed up data preparation and curation . Like any plumber , you would n't want to bring a single tool to the jobsite . Instead a data scientist should have access to a variety of tools and be prepared to use the right one for the task at hand . <p> I 'll be discussing both the need for solutions and some of the available tools in a VentureBeat webinar on Oct. 1 , 12:30 p.m . EST . The webinar is sponsored by Tamr , a big data "" plumbers helper "" that I advise .

"<h> Hey Jude -- ' My son has become isolated over the past year ' <p> I am worried about my 17-year-old son . He has become gradually more isolated over the past year or so , and wo n't open up to me at all . I try to ask him what 's wrong but he says nothing is wrong . He has a group of close friends and although I would like him to be doing better , he is getting on alright in school also . As far as I can tell his form is ok most of the time , but I just wish he would spend more time with the rest of us in the house , instead of being stuck in his room all the time . I 'm worried it 's not healthy for him especially with all the talk of young men being vulnerable to suicide these days . <p> Advertisement <p> Thank you , Vera . <p> Hi Vera , <p> Thank you for your email , I understand this is really worrying you at the moment . It is hard sometimes being a mother , and particularly being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their own independent adult life . I can empathise with your worry in regards to his isolation and the awareness of how vulnerable young men can be in relation to their mental health . <p> It can be a cause of alarm to become aware of how isolated your son is , and then to link this to a possible susceptibility to suicide , however take some time to look at the reality of the situation . It can be easy to let fear take over and make links that are not actually there . <p> I sense from your email that what you are struggling most with , is the amount of time your son is choosing to spend away from the family , and the distance which is growing between you both . While I can understand your concerns about him isolating himself , it would be quite normal for a 17-year-old to begin to pull away from their family and spend more time alone , and with their peers . This is part of healthy development . It is important for a teenager to be given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop their identity , autonomous from their family . To do this , being alone is important . And at his age , his peer group are the most influential , in comparison to years earlier , when his parents would have had a more central role in terms of role modelling . I am not suggesting for a minute that your parenting role is over , but it is going through an adjustment period at present . <p> Although I have said that your son being alone is important for his development , I do understand that it is concerning for you . You have said that when you ask him what is wrong , that his reply is that nothing is wrong . Maybe that is true ? It is possible that there is actually nothing wrong but your teenage son trying to find his identity in the world . Instead of asking him what is wrong , I would encourage you to tell him that if is there is anything at all bothering him , that you are there to listen . You are letting him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of assuming something is wrong already . This way , if he needs help , he knows you are there to listen . Voice your concerns about him isolating himself , and allow him to tell you what life is like for him right now . <p> Do n't be afraid to tell him how you feel , keep the focus on your feelings , instead of focusing on what he is doing right or wrong . And most importantly ; listen to what he has to say . Open up the lines of communication , without judgement or assumptions , and listen to him . Apart from that , there is not much you can , or need to do . If you are concerned about suicide , ask him directly if he has had any suicidal thoughts . All you can do is ask , and again , by asking , you are letting him know you are there when he needs you . If he says yes , then seek further help , and if he says no , then at least he knows you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Either way , you are better off asking the question , rather than worrying about the unknown .

"<p> New Trend Report reveals the latest industry trajectory and innovations , introduces a world where everyone , everything , everywhere is connected <p> A recent industry survey by DHL reveals 60% of logistics professionals have inadequate supply chain visibility . 75% plan to implement at least one Next-Generation Wireless technology in the near future as part of their visibility strategy <p> Next-Generation Wireless continues to fuel digital transformation and launches logistics sector into the future of full visibility , wide-scale automation , and predictability . <p> DHL has released "" Next-Generation Wireless in Logistics "" , a new Trend Report that offers a comprehensive look at the evolution of wireless networks and the future of the Internet of Things ( IoT ) in logistics . The report summarizes the logistics industry perspective and recent numbers , paving the way to a common understanding of different wireless technologies by showcasing examples and envisioning future possibilities for next-generation wireless . <p> Connecting Everyone , Everything , Everywhere <p> Even before the current COVID-19 crisis , wireless communication technology was making headlines . Much of the recent interest has focused on 5G mobile data networks that are being rolled out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end-users , businesses , and telecommunications systems operators alike , including higher speeds , greater capacity , and tailored services for a new generation of smart connected devices . <p> - Advertisement - <p> Beyond 5G , progress across a wide range of different wireless communication technologies is now creating new opportunities for logistics to improve visibility , enhance operational efficiency , and accelerate automation . Well-known technologies like WiFi and Bluetooth and lesser-known technologies like Low Power Wide Area Networks ( LPWAN ) and Low Earth Orbit ( LEO ) Satellites have been enhanced for industrial use . These next-generation wireless technologies will enable the next step in the communication revolution , moving towards a new world in which everyone and everything can be connected everywhere . <p> Building a fully connected future for logistics <p> In a recent survey of 800 supply chain leaders conducted by DHL , 60% of respondents stated that visibility of their supply chain is currently inadequate . The top three key challenges among the respondents are achieving true end-to-end visibility , lack of a single centralized platform to drive IoT initiatives , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The top three priorities identified shaping visibility strategies are end-to-end transportation visibility , inventory visibility , and the implementation of supply chain data analytics. 75% of respondents reported they intend to implement at least one next-generation wireless technology in the near future to achieve their visibility goals . <p> - Advertisement - <p> "" After having transformed asset-light industries , the digital revolution is now rapidly changing more asset-heavy industries , from automotive and manufacturing companies to healthcare providers , "" says Markus K ? ckelhaus , Vice President Innovation &amp; Trend Research , DHL Customer Solutions &amp; Innovation . "" Our own sector , logistics , will be both a major beneficiary of the IoT-enabled digital revolution and an enabler of it . Although some parts of the logistics industry are already smart and connected , next generation-wireless is set to usher in the next wave of IoT in logistics . "" In a future where everyone and everything is online everywhere , three key things will become possible for the logistics industry : <p> Total Visibility : Every shipment , logistics asset , infrastructure , and facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-performance sensors . This will enable highly efficient automation , process improvement , swifter and more transparent incident resolution , and -- ultimately -- the best service quality for both B2B and B2C customers . <p> Wide-Scale Autonomy : All autonomous vehicles , whether indoor robots or logistics vehicles on public roads , rely on ultra-fast , reliable wireless communication to navigate and traverse their worlds effectively . While these solutions are on the rise today , next-generation wireless will be one key enabler driving their widespread use and moving the world to autonomous supply chains . <p> Perfecting Prediction : With so many things online , the volume , velocity , and variety of data that we collect will triple the big data already being generated today . The continued progress of machine learning systems and artificial intelligence paired with the ultra-low latency of next generation-wireless means that data-driven prediction systems for forecasting , delivery timing and routing may no longer be constrained by latency and performance of wireless networks . <p> While much of the forecast growth will be achieved using technologies that are already familiar to many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can offer new capabilities , including higher capacity , greater reach , faster speeds , better energy efficiency , and lower costs . <p> "" Large-scale connectivity is an extraordinary technological and social success story . While IoT is not new in logistics , with 20 billion connected devices already in use globally , this story is still only just beginning . A myriad of technologies is simultaneously advancing at a rapid rate , which is also cost-effective and increasingly ubiquitous . They are now becoming more accessible which suddenly opens up vast opportunities for the development of applications and use cases at an unprecedented rate , "" explains Matthias Heutger , SVP , Global Head of Innovation &amp; Commercial Development , DHL . "" Our Trend Report illustrates each of these next-gen wireless technologies , and outlines and compares them , their limitations as well as practical application . Furthermore , we highlight how the potential associated with these technologies is fast becoming a fundamental part of the supply chain of tomorrow . "" <p> Next-generation wireless is a broad portfolio of technologies that promise to deliver against those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trend Report includes a specialized section on how the latest wireless technology works , highlights some innovative projects underway in the industry and provides implementation guidelines for supply chain organizations . <h> Related <p> - Advertisement - <h> Subscribe to BrandSpur Ng <p> Subscribe for latest updates .

"<p> There 's never been a better time to be in marketing , but there has never been a worse time to identify the talent that marketing will need in the future . <p> Share this article <p> All of my research and experience suggests that marketing will thrive and prosper as a valuable and purposeful career in the Fourth Industrial Revolution -- an era of emergent and disruptive new technologies . <p> Marketing may have been perceived as a less prestigious or credible career compared to law , accountancy or engineering because it is not locked into a regulated , rigid structure of training and certification . <p> But that perceived weakness has become its greatest strength . Marketers are not trained to a universal standard -- instead they come from diverse backgrounds and bring multi-faceted skills to the table . They are also the owners of the organisation 's largest intangible asset , it 's brand . <p> Marketers ' ability to adapt , learn and share will be invaluable to organisations , not least because adaptability and lifelong learning have become indispensable traits . <p> As companies and markets become more complex , and as technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expertise required by marketing will expand each year . <p> New roles , old roles <p> I first became a CMO in the late ' 90s , a period when the internet was first commercialised and in the midst of the dot.com bubble . Google was in its infancy , Amazon was growing rapidly , Apple was yet to launch the iPod or iPhone and there was no such thing as ' social media ' . <p> The intervening years have been transformative , not just for consumers but also for marketers as a host of new jobs were created : digital marketing , social media marketing , social listening , influencer marketing , SEO , marketing automation , branded content , cloud marketing , big data analysis , data mining , programmatics , user experience , and so much more . <p> We now see job titles such as ' data wrangler ' , ' SEO ninja ' and ' chief storyteller ' . <p> At the same time , some roles in marketing , communications and sales have seen their influence decrease . <p> Some of these roles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under threat of extinction : press officers working with print media , direct salesmen , telemarketers , offline market researchers and staff who prepare physical marketing collateral or pitch documents . <p> Even advertising executives must evolve -- Google , for example , is the world 's largest ad agency and it does n't have any advertising executives . <p> Nevertheless , the core skills of marketing ( creativity , message development and management , market segmentation , intelligence gathering ) are more in demand than ever before . They are simply using different formats and different tools . <p> What can we learn from this period of unprecedented change ? Firstly , that more jobs will be created than will be destroyed or diminished . Secondly , that traditional marketing skills will be necessary , but will be implemented using new tools , formats and methods . <p> From this short review of marketing roles over the last 20 years , we have some clues as to the future of marketing roles . <p> It may be tempting to predict that roles will be subsumed by artificial intelligence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could and offering decisive actions based on that analysis . <p> It is often predicted that routine and repetitive roles will be automated by software , leaving marketers to focus on human skills that robots are yet to master , such as visual creativity , building relationships , generating insight from disparate data sources and storytelling with emotional impact . <p> However , I do not believe that the future of marketing will be that simple -- because of the way in which marketing will evolve . Druker 's famous maxim , "" marketing is too important to be left to the marketing department "" , will become a reality as marketing moves from the periphery to the core of the extended enterprise . Everyone will become a marketer , but with different specialisms . <p> Marketing as an enabler of transformation <p> Moving away from its outdated role as sales support , marketing will sit at the epicentre of transformational and strategic change -- either as a driver or an enabler of change . Rather than managing robots and analysing data , marketing becomes the strategic centre of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries , where marketing has risen in terms of its contribution to corporate strategy , its role as an enabler of digital transformation , as an owner of client relationship development and as a manager of intangible assets . <p> As a CMO , I have always told my teams one thing : always take the high ground , or else you 'll be condemned to work the low ground forever . I always pushed for marketing to be at the strategic centre and always tried to get a seat at the top table . <p> It is n't always an easy route , especially in the B2B sector . People accuse you of not wanting to get your hands dirty , or they do not see strategy as marketing 's main role . <p> I may have been premature in my aspirations back then , because now is the best time for marketing to take centre stage through digital transformation and enabling a more client-centric organisation . <p> ITSMA , the association for technology , communications and professional services providers , has been tracking this progress in a recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are taking full ownership of vital programmes such as positioning and new offerings , targeting new markets , client insight and profiling , customer journey , digital marketing infrastructure , research and development . <p> However , there is still a gap between perception and reality . This research also shows that the board 's acknowledgement of marketing 's influence on revenue generation is not backed up by allowing marketing to fully contribute to overall business strategy . <p> VIM Group 's Brand Performance Study shows that businesses perform better when their brand is a strategic starting point . Despite that , only 7% of organisations use brand as a starting point for business decisions -- while marketing as a whole remains confined to strategic matters within its own marketing bubble . <p> This perception gap is shared by the younger generation , who still have a limited definition of the range and potential of marketing disciplines . They tend to equate marketing with advertising and the pernicious manipulation that they see as characteristic of advertising . This perception must evolve to unlock the strategic potential of marketing . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are several key areas where marketing can take strategic ownership -- while also evolving its own perception among both employers and employees : <p> Owning the client agenda <p> The role of client ownership can become an all-encompassing responsibility for marketing . The great divide between Sales and Marketing is already converging . Sales will undergo its own transformation , with a reduced need for middlemen and direct sales teams . <p> The concept of ' my client ' , individual ownership of a client relationship , will become outdated or even dangerous . Instead , prospecting will be automated and sales qualification will be done by intelligent agents using predictive analysis . <p> Marketing will become the owner of three key intangible assets : brand , content and causes . <p> These assets span the complete lifetime of the client relationship , both online and offline , enabling marketers to measure and manage total client lifetime value to the company . <p> In terms of brand , marketing will continue to own this but with much wider responsibilities , encompassing the management and measurement of brand perception among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To own the measurement of brand value , marketers must be expert on the financial techniques of brand valuation and how that value can be grown over time . <p> In terms of content , marketing will be involved in the management of content and its rights , covering research , selection , creation , editorial and distribution . This will include responsibility for legal protections of content such as copyright , plus rights to re-use , replicate , upgrade or sunset content . <p> This means that editors , journalists , film makers , broadcasters and even dramatists can all be members of the marketing team of the future . This content must be personalised and personal -- both qualities which are easier said than done . <p> Brand portals play a key role in the management of this content and should be considered as part of the infrastructure of any successful brand management activity . <p> Finally , cause will be a key area of judgement for companies . Marketing will promote specific causes for the sake of their impact on society and the environment , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital for talent attraction , as millennials increasingly prioritise employers with strong credentials in this area . And in that sense , future marketing must work both on the supply side ( i.e. attracting talent ) and on the demand side ( i.e. attracting clients ) . <p> Storytelling <p> To pull all of this together , marketing will need a range of creative writers and storytellers who can master all new media . <p> Storytelling may be an ancient form of marketing , but as tools and platforms proliferate it is now confronted with a period of omni-channel storytelling . There are exciting opportunities to engage target audiences with compelling content in a format that they are already accustomed to . <p> During my time at JLL , for example , we set up a range of new online publications that we dubbed ' brand journalism ' . In-house we recruited editors , journalists , cinematographers , studio managers and broadcasters -- all functions that would normally be sourced from an agency . <p> This team created relevant and influential ( but not necessarily promotional ) content such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the client 's language , or trends analysis that made complex topics simple and easy to understand . <p> To illustrate this , ITSMA identified the most in-demand roles cover thought leadership and content development , marketing technology and performance analytics . These roles all blend the art of storytelling with the science of marketing . <p> Structure , culture and change <p> Future marketing will also play a key role in the internal cohesion within a company or organisation , helping to overcome silos , making key messages coherent and to give that culture a voice . <p> To achieve this , marketing requires a collaborative culture . The old-fashioned marketing department , made up of independent skillsets , is dying out . Silos of expertise , of global versus local , internal versus external and old school versus new school must be broken up and re-shaped . <p> You might compare this new structure to a film studio , where a thin layer of management has the ability to coalesce as an expert team , led by a director , in order see a project through to completion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have to do this productively , efficiently , quickly and within budget . <p> The overarching culture of future marketing must be as a value generator for clients , the wider enterprise , the brand , its causes , the employees and all stakeholders . <p> Charles Doyle is Executive Advisor to brand management and implementation specialist VIM Group . He is currently a non-executive director , strategic advisor , author and consultant on all aspects of marketing and communications . <p> Over the last 35 years , Charles has built a successful track record working for international companies in the USA , Europe and Asia , specialising in professional services marketing , global brand and image development , digital marketing and communications . <p> A published writer and conference speaker , he is author of the widely acclaimed Oxford Dictionary of Marketing ."
"<h> Singapore FinTech Festival 2018 <h> Fintech advances add up to a bright new financial future , says MAS chief <p> Monetary Authority of Singapore managing director Ravi Menon envisages a world where a person can get an instant and complete picture of where they stand with regards to cash , tax and other money-related matters.PHOTO : BLOOMBERG <p> SINGAPORE - The vision of a financial sector where a person can get an instant and complete picture of where they stand with regards to cash , tax and other money-related matters was outlined by the managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore ( MAS ) on Monday ( Nov 12 ) . <p> Mr Ravi Menon said such a new world would mean a person would have a personal financial dashboard that pulls data from their banks , insurers and brokers . <p> It would also contain tax liabilities and mortgages and provide advice based on milestones in that person 's life . <p> "" This is the financial sector we want to create , customised ( to ) our needs , invisible to our eyes , and an absolute delight , "" said Mr Menon . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future meant marshalling necessary ingredients like common standards , inclusive collaboration and a free flow of ideas , knowledge and people . <p> "" Innovation and technology are key to realising this future , but they are not enough , "" Mr Menon added . What is necessary is to grow a fintech , or financial technology , ecosystem that includes platforms for innovation and good data governance standards . <p> One initiative involved the MAS working with the Infocomm Media Development Authority to roll out a global services marketplace for small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) . <p> Business Sans Borders , as it is called , aims to connect SMEs on a platform where they can explore collaborative ways to digitise their business processes and lower costs , said Mr Menon . <p> "" It will ( also ) allow solution providers to more effectively reach out to SMEs ( that ) tend to be highly dispersed and sometimes hard to reach , "" he added . <p> The initiative will start with a proof-of-concept in 2019 with features such as a sandbox where start-ups and established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also have an app store where SMEs can access services , including finance , logistics and human resources . <p> Another feature is an artificial intelligence engine that matches suppliers with buyers for products and services across the region . <p> The MAS has also been trying to reap the benefits of technology by working with the industry to develop principles to guide data usage in financial services . These were released on Monday . <p> Mr Menon said : "" Data must be used in a responsible , transparent and ethical manner . We must be able to explain the results of data-driven algorithms . We can not hide behind the black box . "" <p> Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat told media at the festival that fintech should lower the costs of engaging customers and will allow for greater financial inclusion as banks can reach out to the unbanked population . <p> Mr Heng noted : "" Fintech ... has opened up many new possibilities .

"<h> How new data technologies are being used to combat the global pandemic <p> Daily routine has been disrupted and business realities have changed overnight <p> Shares <p> ( Image credit : Shutterstock ) <p> We are all glued to our screens tracking the progress of the ongoing pandemic . Our daily routine has been disrupted , and business realities have changed overnight . Factories are converted to produce respirators , restaurants are limited to take away , retailers to online sites , and supermarkets are running out of supplies due to panic buying and broken supply chains . <p> Many countries are still struggling to find the best way to combat the virus . But on the bright side , there have been new innovations that collect and leverage data to protect citizens from the pandemic . New solutions powered by data including electronic surveillance solutions and machine learning models are now in place to prevent the spread of the disease . <p> Since test kits are in short supply and test results can take several days , new methods have been developed for faster diagnosis . China has developed cameras and goggles armed with thermal imaging to identify people with fevers in a crowd . San Francisco-based Kinsa Health has sold or given away more than one million smart thermometers to record fevers in near real-time , both for home use and in medical facilities . Having millions of data points allows Kinsa to produce daily maps showing which counties are seeing spiking fevers . <p> Track movement <p> Governments are accessing CCTV footage , GPS tracking data from phones and cars , credit card transactions , immigration entry information , and other personal details of citizens to track movements of infected people . In South Korea , legislation gave the government authority to collect mobile phone , credit card , and other data from infected individuals and share this information on social media to warn people that they may have been exposed . It was recently reported that the US government is in "" active talks "" with tech companies including Facebook and Google about using location data to track movements of people infected by the virus . <p> Enforce quarantine <p> Governments have taken steps to monitor people in quarantine , including forcing them to wear devices that track their movements , and notify them in the event that they wander beyond their restricted areas . Starting March 19th , The Hong Kong government required arriving passengers to wear an electronic wristband with instructions to walk around the house so that technology can precisely track the boundaries of their living space . The South Korean Ministry of the Interior rolled out the "" Self-Quarantine Safety Protection "" app , used to monitor roughly 30,000 people who were told to stay at home for two weeks . If a person takes their phone out of a restricted area , an alert will go off and a case officer will be notified . <p> Record contacts <p> Singapore has made available an app , Trace Together that exchanges short-distance Bluetooth signals when users are near one another . Records of those encounters , including the duration , are stored in their respective phones for 21 days and used to identify people who were in close proximity and may have been potentially infected including family members , colleagues , and fellow travelers . <p> Despite the fast development of these solutions , there are still technical limitations . Data scientists are challenged with accessing , preparing and analysing their massive and growing volumes of data . Insights that are highly time sensitive , for example sensing when a quarantine has been breached , can take hours instead of minutes . In order to feed different types of data into a model , including CCTV images and credit card transactions , data preparation may take too long , slowing down the processing . Especially now when rapid analysis of data has the potential to save lives , data scientists should consider GPU-based data management solutions and other highly efficient access and storage methods to analyse very large data stores for time-sensitive insights . <p> The coronavirus has triggered a chain of innovation , powered by huge volumes of data . All this data needs to be rolled up , ingested , analysed , and shared in a timely way so we can take action to help prevent the spread of the disease . By using data to track the disease and model its behaviour , we can hopefully make the coronavirus pandemic an inconceivable event of the past ."

"<h> Strategy 17 of the 20 least competitive economies in the world are in Africa . Here is why it 's not a surprise <p> African countries rank the worst in the latest Global Competitiveness Report published by the World Economic Forum . <p> play A worker picks tea at a plantation in Githunguri near Kenya 's capital Nairobi ( REUTERS/Thomas Mukoya/File Photo ) <p> news <h> In the latest Global Competitiveness Report - a review of indicators responsible for productivity and long-term growth of selected countries - published by the World Economic Forum , African countries ranked the worst . <p> Out of the 140 countries studied , the highest placed African economy was Mauritius at 49 with the closest being South Africa in 67 . Majority of the ranked countries from the continent languish in the bottom third with the only non-African countries in that category being Venezuela , Haiti and Yemen . <p> This abysmal performance in one of the key reports on measuring economic progress reiterates the deplorable state Africa 's economy finds itself , at least for a while now . And below is a breakdown of the four primary factors responsible . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is difficult for African countries to break into the top half of this index is market monopoly . The concerned economies have varying degrees of unhealthy relationships between politics and business , which leaves the control of the means of production with a few . <p> The best situation ought to be an open space for interested entrepreneurs or corporations to compete at an individual pace . Rather , key sectors including transportation , petroleum and energy , usually have the government as a sole provider of services . <p> In the few cases where there is private participation , prices and supply are dictated by big corporations in liaison with corrupt politicians . This effectively eliminates the required competition needed to improve the ability of the market to meet demand at the least cost to African consumers , who have the lowest income earnings globally . <p> It also translates to the loss of modifications necessary to increase consumer choice and satisfaction . With the consumer having little to no option of rejecting a commodity , the traditional channel of communication in the market is eliminated , hence the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be considered the closest factor to market competitiveness is innovation - the process of idea generation geared towards maximising gains from investments . <p> While the rest of the world is frequently updating to the latest inventions in robotics and artificial intelligence , none of the lowly ranked African countries has successfully embraced science and technology in their educational systems to start with . Not to make mention of the different sectors of the economy . <h> Unfavourable business environment <p> The Business Enabling Environment ( BEE ) in most parts of the continent is a far cry from what should be a tolerable minimum . This means that factors that determine the BEE of an economy , specifically regulatory policies and business laws , can not generally be considered tolerable in Africa . As such , it constitutes a lot of challenges for businesses to thrive . <p> For example , starting a business or registering a property in most places in sub-Saharan Africa usually takes longer than normal , an effort that ordinarily should not exceed 1 to 3 work days . In Nigeria for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Same as Cameroon , while in places like DR Congo , Niger and Burundi , it may take longer . <p> It is one reason sub-Saharan Africa is recognised as the worst place for entrepreneurs and , consequently , these bureaucratic delays are a red flag when studying the competitiveness of an economy . One might even consider the low degree of competition among state-owned enterprises , bigger corporations and micro-and small enterprises ( MSEs ) as telling signs of why Africa will find it hard to score high in the study . <p> These red tapes coupled with the weak protection of private properties complicates the decision-making process for value chain actors , like farmers , local merchants and the consumer . In the end , it makes the amount of value they add to the economy as a function of market competition to be quite low . <p> But these challenges can be avoided if African governments could simply stop imposing unnecessary regulations . However , with that unlikely to happen any time soon , the business environment will remain hostile . <h> Weak human capital <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GDP of their countries - a considerably low quota due to the deplorable state of education and quality of life . <p> The ability of an average African worker to significantly contribute to the market process has remained relatively stagnant for decades while the youth population continues to grow without an increase in job availability or skills . <p> This puts the market value of the skill set of an average African worker among the lowest in the world - according to the recent Human Capital Index of the World Bank Group ( WBG ) . <p> It has created a wide gap between the availability of required skills and modern industrial demand for labour . It is also the same reason why 70 per cent of the continent 's labour force finds itself in the Agricultural sector . <p> Meanwhile , education is the key to driving human productivity . In fact , the more countries invest in technical education nowadays , the farther their economies are likely to improve in areas of science and technology . <p> For the concerned African countries , the next step in improving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other needs like health , security and nutrition can always follow ."
"<h> James Cameron pessimistic about artificial intelligence <p> James Cameron , who is all set to reboot the ' Terminator ' franchise , believes artificial intelligence will probably be bad for the human race . <p> PTI Updated : Sep 30 , 2017 , 17:43 IST <p> James Cameron , who is all set to reboot the ' Terminator ' franchise , believes artificial intelligence will probably be bad for the human race . In an interview Cameron reflected upon ' Terminator ' and the advances in artificial intelligence . <p> ' Terminator ' revolves around a cyborg assassin who is sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 to kill the woman whose son will one day become a Saviour against machines in a post- apocalyptic future . Cameron has collaborated with ' Deadpool ' director Tim Miller to carry forward the franchise . The director said he is often asked the question about man versus machines , a theme that is recurrent in his films . <p> "" Technology has always scared me , and it 's always seduced me . People ask me , ' Will the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Look at people on their phones . The machines have already won ' . It 's just ( that ) they 've won in a different way , "" the director , best known for blockbusters such as ' Titanic ' and ' Avatar ' , said . <p> The filmmaker said while technology and humans were co- evolving , there might come a time when artificial intelligence will become too advanced for the human race . "" One of the scientists we met with recently , she said : ' I used to be really , really optimistic , but now I 'm just scared . ' Her position on it is probably that we ca n't control this . It has more to do with human nature . "" <p> "" ... At the very least , they will reflect our best and worst nature because we make them and we programme them . But it 's going to take a lot of money . So who 's got the money to do it and the will to do it ? It could be business , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . <p> Cameron said that like other previous inventions , artificial intelligence could be weaponised . <p> "" And if you 're doing it for business , you 're doing it to improve your market share or whatever your business goals are . So you 're essentially taking a machine smarter than a human and teaching it greed . Or it 's for defense , in which case you 're taking a machine smarter than a human and teaching it to kill .

"<h> Scientists one step closer to understanding of the world 's oceans <p> An artificial intelligence ( AI ) programme that can automatically provide species-level identification of microscopic marine organisms has been developed by researchers , including one from India . <p> The next step is to incorporate the AI into a robotic system that will help advance our understanding of the world 's oceans , both now and in our prehistoric past , said researchers , including Ritayan Mitra , a former postdoctoral researcher at North Carolina State University in the US , who is now at IIT Bombay . <p> Specifically , the AI programme has proven capable of identifying six species of foraminifera , or forams -- organisms that have been prevalent in Earth 's oceans for over 100 million years , according to the study published in the journal Marine Micropaleontology . <p> Forams are protists , neither plant nor animal . When they die , they leave behind their tiny shells , most less than a millimetre wide . These shells give scientists insights into the characteristics of the oceans as they existed when the forams were alive . <p> For example , different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environments , and chemical measurements can tell scientists about everything from the ocean 's chemistry to its temperature when the shell was being formed . <p> However , evaluating those foram shells and fossils is both tedious and time consuming . <p> "" At this point , the AI correctly identifies the forams about 80 per cent of the time , which is better than most trained humans , "" said Edgar Lobaton , an associate professor at North Carolina State University . <p> "" But this is only the proof of concept . We expect the system to improve over time , because machine learning means the programme will get more accurate and more consistent with every iteration . <p> "" We also plan to expand the AI 's purview , so that it can identify at least 35 species of forams , rather than the current six , "" Lobaton said . <p> The current system works by placing a foram under a microscope capable of taking photographs . An LED ring shines light onto the foram from 16 directions -- one at a time -- while taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> These 16 images are combined to provide as much geometric information as possible about the foram 's shape . The AI then uses this information to identify the foram 's species . <p> The scanning and identification takes only seconds , and is already as fast -- or faster -- than the fastest human experts . <p> "" Plus , the AI does n't get tired or bored . This work demonstrates the successful first step toward building a robotic platform that will be able to identify , pick and sort forams automatically , "" Lobaton said . <p> The researchers have received a grant from the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , to build the fully-functional robotic system . <p> "" This work is important because oceans cover about 70 per cent of Earth 's surface and play an enormous role in its climate , "" said Tom Marchitto , an associate professor at the University of Colorado , Boulder . <h> Read more <p> "" Forams are ubiquitous in our oceans , and the chemistry of their shells records the physical and chemical characteristics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> "" These tiny organisms bear witness to past properties like temperature , salinity , acidity and nutrient concentrations . In turn we can use those properties to reconstruct ocean circulation and heat transport during past climate events . <p> "" This matters because humanity is in the midst of an unintentional , global-scale climate ' experiment ' due to our emission of greenhouse gases , "" Marchitto said . q! q! q! q! q! q!"

"<h> #IMCConf 2017 : The artificially intelligent business of big data <p> Matthew Barclay of Meltwater , Brett St Clair of Barclay Africa and Justin Spratt of Uber SSA kicked off IMC Conference 2017 at the White Space in Red &amp; Yellow School Cape Town with a session focused on big data , how AI will fundamentally change the world of work and its specific business implications . <p> Integrated Marketing Communications or IMC Conference MC Di Charton welcomed a full room of the country 's brightest marketing minds on 1 June 2017 , speaking of Red &amp; Yellow as her ' new home for the last five years ' , while the IMC conference has been going since 2010 . <p> Barclay , Spratt and St Clair . <p> Charton explained that sponsors for the conference were carefully selected , with IBM emerging as a cognitive thought leader and Meltwater encouraging all to follow in their footsteps by benchmarking , listening and engaging in real-time . The day 's topics were then split into themes with speakers involved in panel discussions as well as live Q&amp;A sessions based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendees engaged . <p> The first speaker of the day was the red-sneakered Matthew Barclay , area director for Africa at Meltwater , on ' the tools of tomorrow 's marketer : Automated anomaly detection in big data ' . We all want to understand data and talk about it all the time , but Barclay said it 's more than a collection of buzzwords - though the three main ones are : Big data , AI and anomaly detection . In revealing previously unknown connections , we can better understand why a customer purchases from a specific location or at a certain time of year , therefore making connections between data points we would n't have understood before and smarter marketing decisions . <p> Barclay mentioned using the four Vs of volume , velocity , variety and value as qualifying criteria , then played a brief video by PWC director Ken Kryst on big data projects and how to better target your advertising to reach your consumers more effectively . Barclay concluded that we simply do n't have the human resources to effectively make sense of big data in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This led into a discussion of the second buzzword Barclay identified - artificial intelligence or AI . Noting your perceptions vs the reality are important here as many in the industry fear their marketing jobs will be taken over by robots in the next few years -- Barclay reassures us this is n't true . That said , there is amazing technological development focused on the most effective advertising solutions . Take M&amp;C Saatchi London , for example , which created the world 's first poster that evolves and generates new , unique adverts based on how much attention it attracts - this involves customising aspects such as text size , image types and colours and length of copy as the billboard understands what you are looking at , feeds that into the system and changes what it shows you . <p> Barclay says this brings up interesting questions on creativity and whether it can create unique advertising based on the data it picks up down the line . From the context of SEO , when creating content he says to think of Google 's new RankBrain AI algorithm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it thinks you will be interested in looking at when entering a specific search term . <p> Looking at AI in CX , Barclay says this will become a major brand differentiator . Think of the rise and use of chatbots , which create a scenario where an SA online store or interactive website can chat to someone in any country logging on in a different time zone . They do n't need to wait for your open hours , they can chat to your business and even complete transactions when suits them best to do so . <p> Even more jaw-dropping is the fact that the following video from Cornell University of two chatbots conversing with each other is already five-years-old , showing that human-like traits like memory and crafting responses around what is being said are possible in technology : <p> For AI in targeting then , Barclay says this will be based on prediction rather than on purely historical data or cookies . Technology surrounds us , delights and surprises us , such as when our phones prompt us to leave home early to skip traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what we 've been watching . <p> He concluded that anomaly detection takes this a step further by only notifying you of a change in the pattern of that data for business insights - that 's why it 's the way of the future . <h> The milliseconds of micro moments <p> Brett St Clair , ex-Google now head of digital product at Barclay Africa , next at the podium on the topic of using just one click to sell anything , without ever needing to physically interact with consumers . <p> He said that disrupting digitally means literally changing how we work by focusing on the customer . We think of ' digital ' as websites and mobile , but that 's the old digital . Now , ' digital ' lies in the fact that the internet comes with you , so you can share your story from a device that 's becoming ubiquitous as the world changes , and that change is based on the era of the selfie . <p> The world has been flipped on its head , with St Clair pointing out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of himself with the attendees -- we are understanding the context of the consumer , what they are doing and what their world looks like as we enter these micro moments . They are happening by the billions across your audience , so you need to be there when they are ready to purchase your product . That 's why he says your customer is always just a click away , and that we need to use real-time analytics to best understand how they consume our content . <p> It 's a process where you never need to even see the customer in real-life . On scaling moments with AI , it 's an industry that 's been going for 50 years , in understanding how humans communicate with machines , developing consciousness and learning at scale as they progress . St Clair says this is selling of the future . On straight-through processing , it 's a one-click experience based on building delightful experiences . Airlines all sell seats , and whatever your industry , it 's a commodity once you scrape away the glitter , so how do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available through the cloud . <p> St Clair left us with three tips for getting this right : <p> Shopify everything . Algorithms are freely available , there 's no need to start from scratch . <p> Hire him or her -- seriously . UX designers are the future of business . <p> Try this -- you need to be on the bleeding edge of technology , using Snapchat , and Instagram and everything else that comes along . It 's changing the way we communicate and collaborate so we need to "" get uncomfortably excited "" . <h> Redesigning the customer experience <p> Australian Justin Spratt , headhunted by Uber to become their head of business for the sub-Saharan Africa region , rounded out the first session of the day by speaking of tech trends and Africa : seeing around corners as well as how software is ' eating the world ' , with Amazon as the poster child for this . Spratt kicked off with a reminder that Africa is mobile-first , with 90% mobile penetration at this stage and 50% smartphone penetration expected by 2018 . Interestingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data is turned off on the smart phones and internet is only accessed in Wi-Fi zones . "" Nothing is impossible here ; you need to stretch your imagination to reach the masses , "" says Spratt . <p> Linked to this , brands need to reset how they brand themselves , especially when it comes to consumer trust . It 's a real challenge as brands are being disintermediated over time and it 's no longer about brute-force balance sheets , it 's now about the bits . <p> Inspired by the imagination of children , Net#work BBDO and visual effects and animation agency Sinister Studio applied technology to advertising to create a virtual reality ( VR ) campaign for Mercedes-Benz South Africa ... <p> Spratt adds that VR is immersive and that progress happens at the edges , so while VR quite literally just looks like a toy for now , it has the potential , for example , to change education in Africa in the next decade . He says a well-designed product and communication can get you anywhere , but you 'll probably need to redesign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spratt ended with the assertion that media , as the new opium of the masses , needs to insert itself in the process and drive trust in products . <p> In a panel discussion with all three speakers , Spratt said direct , highly relevant marketing will continue apace , with St Clair explaining that branding is currently fairly static . The culmination of machine learning and big data for relevance thus needs to be balanced with personal data that helps you better respond to consumers and tweak your messaging on the fly . Barclay chipped in that the ' creativity element ' is still relevant but marketers need to now push the opportunity to see , putting the budget behind promoting the amazing content they create through that advertising clutter . <p> On digital disruption , St Clair said it 's easy to say your company ' fails fast ' , but not so easy to iterate as it requires constant change and effort in AB testing . Any business has the capacity to do so , provided you put in the effort and passion required to continuously disrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> About Leigh Andrews <p> Leigh Andrews ( @leighandrews ) is Editor-in-Chief : Marketing &amp; Media at Bizcommunity.com and one of our Lifestyle contributors .

"<h> Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz talks inequality , power and profits <p> He 's a big fan of New Zealand 's "" well-being budget "" , but Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz believes much more needs to be done to tackle tax avoidance , inequality and the widespread sense that "" something 's wrong "" . <p> They call economics the dismal science , but there 's little that 's dull about Joseph Stiglitz , the Nobel-prize winning economist and bestselling author . He seems positively beaming when we meet , having worked up a deep tan on holiday in Spain . But more than his complexion , it 's his mind that dazzles . <p> A former chief economist at the World Bank , Stiglitz , 76 , is based at New York 's Columbia University , but he also gives classes at the Paris Institute of Political Studies and travels widely , including several visits to New Zealand , where he has a cousin in Auckland . For an outspoken critic of the management of globalisation , he has a global reach , sitting on panels and advising governments around the world . As recently as last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Macro alias : ModuleRenderer <h> Blood in the water <p> His latest book , People , Power and Profits , is another impassioned warning of the dangers of unfettered markets and the corruption of the political process by big business . At our previous encounter in 2015 , he was promoting The Great Divide , which raised a flag about the widening gap between rich and poor . Back then it struck me that he bore a resemblance to the actor Richard Dreyfuss . Not just his looks , but also in his slightly disdainful assessment of the political elites , which was analogous to Dreyfuss ' attitude towards the insular authorities in Jaws . And , as in the film , no one listened . That great white shark Donald Trump still swam up and became US President . Then there was Brexit , the rise of populism and a kind of full-blown identity crisis in the West . But Stiglitz has n't walked away in despair . Rather , he sees these developments as a form of protest . <p> "" I 'd call them signs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not articulated as inequality upheaval . It 's ' something 's wrong ' upheaval . People think the system is rigged , that it is n't working for them . So , in a sense , it is about inequality . "" <h> Kudos for Kiwis <p> If the global picture is n't too promising at this particular juncture in history , then Stiglitz does see reasons for optimism in New Zealand . In particular , he 's pleased that it 's adopted well-being indicators as part of its performance analysis , rather than , as with most countries , relying on the crude figure of gross domestic product ( GDP ) . The problem with GDP , says Stiglitz , is that it conceals issues such as childhood deprivation . <p> "" New Zealand is leading the way by building these ideas into its budgetary process , and the interesting thing that 's so distinctive about New Zealand is how early it got on to this . "" <p> Last year , he talked to Ardern about the well-being budget that was unveiled in May . The plan had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a long-standing concern of his , on which he consulted New Zealand civil servants and Treasury some years ago . <p> "" I was chairman of the International Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress , "" he says , "" and we emphasised the fact that GDP was not a good indicator . If you want a society that performs well , in a way that most of us think that society ought to be , it wo n't happen by the market itself . "" <p> Stiglitz has advised various politicians , including former US President Bill Clinton , though often his advice has n't been taken and relations have deteriorated . At which point , he 's not been shy about voicing his criticisms . This approach has led to the suggestion that he is not best suited to practical politics . <p> I once asked a leading macroeconomist in New York what he thought of him . "" He 's absolutely brilliant , "" the macroeconomist said , "" but he 's increasingly inclined to pontificate beyond his knowledge or experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inequality is respected , but he 's not someone you 'd ever go to for policy advice . "" <h> Taming Silicon Valley <p> What 's striking about Stiglitz is that he sees solutions to problems everywhere . At the moment , no one seems sure what to do about multinationals such as the tech giants that avoid tax with elaborate offshore methods . If it 's difficult for major nations to go up against them , what does that mean for smaller nations such as New Zealand ? For Stiglitz , it 's straightforward . <p> "" Tax avoidance could be shut down . The US could easily have a global minimum corporate income tax . Anybody who wants to do business in the US pays 15-20% of their corporate income in taxes . If you do n't want to pay tax , you 're not welcome in the United States . If Europe does the same , nobody is going to opt out of operating in the US and Europe , and once you have a global minimum , why should n't New Zealand tax 20% ? "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have so much of a monopoly that they determine the online business models across the globe ? <p> "" Google is good , "" he says , "" but the difference between its search engine and what New Zealand could do on its own is not significant . You have some really good people doing artificial intelligence in New Zealand . So , the ability of competitors to succeed if they were given space for competition is quite great . "" <p> In the short term , he says , the anticompetitive practices of Google , Amazon and Facebook can be easily restricted . He ca n't see why Facebook was ever allowed to buy WhatsApp and Instagram , and believes they should be separated as soon as possible . In his book , he goes into greater detail on longer-term answers to Silicon Valley 's domination . <h> Lessons from Gary <p> One of the reasons he sees viable alternatives to the present arrangement of economic affairs is that he has witnessed great change in the course of his life . As he explains in People , Power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden age of capitalism "" in the steel town of Gary , Indiana . <p> His mother was a schoolteacher and his father an insurance salesman , two examples of an upwardly mobile middle class that Stiglitz believes is under grave threat . Even in this apparent golden age , he writes , he witnessed "" massive racial discrimination and segregation , great inequality , labour strife and episodic recession "" . <p> As with much of the American Midwest , Gary 's industrial base collapsed in the 1980s and 90s and now the city has half the population it had when Stiglitz was a child . Its hollowed-out centre is often used as a Hollywood location for post-apocalyptic films . His desire to understand what was happening in his hometown is what led the young Stiglitz to switch his subject of study from theoretical physics to economics . <p> Although they sound worlds apart , the two disciplines share a fundamental intention : both seek to explain complex systems by mathematical assessment of the different forces that act within them . Stiglitz did his degree at Amherst College , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he was immersed in the Keynesian economics that remain the basis of his outlook -- to Yale , Princeton and Stanford . He gained his Nobel Prize in Economics in 2001 "" for laying the foundations for the theory of markets with asymmetric information "" . <p> That sounds complex , and almost certainly is , but it refers to how transactions work in which one party has more information than the other . For all the seeming abstraction of his theoretical work , Stiglitz is chiefly concerned with the real world . His motivation for understanding macroeconomic systems is so he can try to change them . <p> Reading his books , you soon start to wonder why the world is n't in better shape if the answers are so readily available . You come swiftly to the reassuring conclusion that all it requires is rational action . Unfortunately , we are not rational beings , as much as we may pretend to be . <h> Progressive capitalism <p> Just look at the issue of inequality . At its economic height in the 1950s and 60s , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers on the shop floor . Now , it 's in the region of 300 times . And yet , in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis , when irresponsible bankers were bailed out and the low-paid disproportionately suffered the consequences , what did US voters do about this state of affairs ? They elected a billionaire who boasts of his tax avoidance and gives tax breaks to the super rich . <p> "" I share a little of your mystification , "" says Stiglitz , noting that many Americans , particularly , but not exclusively , Democrats , are outraged by what 's happened . In fact , he seems to think of Trump as someone who has indirectly forged a consensus among US progressives . <p> I 'm not sure that this is true . Since Bernie Sanders ' almost-successful campaign to become the Democratic presidential candidate in the last election , the Democratic Party seems increasingly split between old-style centrists and a new generation of socialists , such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez . Does Stiglitz think of himself as being on their side ? <p> "" AOC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the word ' socialism ' is totally different from the meaning 40 years ago , which was the ownership of the means of production . No one is advocating that in the US . I prefer the term ' progressive capitalism ' for two reasons . "" One is the negative association of socialism with Cold War politics , and the other is that Stiglitz believes in a decentralised market economy -- it 's just that he wants it to serve society as a whole . <h> Trickle-down tosh <p> In many ways , Stiglitz 's argument is quite simple . Capitalism is a wonderful thing but , left to its own devices , it does n't deliver what it promises . The market has a great track record in producing goods , but is clueless about what constitutes the general good . And as we 've lost confidence in our abilities to shape society , we have increasingly and mistakenly subcontracted that job to the whims of private enterprise . <p> This is a lesson that seems to need to be repeatedly learnt , though Stiglitz believes New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labour Government 's Rogernomics , is making efforts to redress some of the inequalities it spawned . <p> "" New Zealand did n't think as much about the distribution consequences as it should have and it overestimated the way that markets on their own would adjust , and underestimated the need for industrial policies . It may have been one of the first countries to adopt a lot of neo-liberal policies , but it 's also been one of the first to leave them . "" <p> Still , we live in a globalised world now and many social and lifestyle changes are global trends that even large , authoritarian nations -- China being one example -- struggle to combat . Though critical of many of the consequences of globalisation , Stiglitz acknowledges that it was an inevitable development and it has delivered extraordinary results for countries such as China and Vietnam . <p> What he takes exception to is the belief in trickle-down economics , which has accompanied globalisation like an evangelical religion . The idea was widely promulgated that if the rich got richer , then everyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . This , he says , was what led to conflict when he was chair of President Clinton 's Council of Economic Advisers . <p> "" I used to have these arguments in the Clinton Administration and basically say , ' Economic theory is so clear that this is not true . How do you believe it 's going to be true ? ' And there was never an answer . "" <p> He thinks no one fully grasped just how much globalisation was going to weaken workers ' bargaining power . The result is that unskilled workers have seen their wages driven down . His answer is to increase workers ' bargaining power , though I 'm not sure how this can be done , especially when it will leave lower-paid foreign workers as an even more attractive source of labour . <p> He implicitly accepts this point , without going so far as to agree , by noting that developed nations should have made much greater efforts to train their unskilled workforces . <h> Radical redistribution <p> Of course , some analysts predict that , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't just be unskilled workers whose jobs will be on the line . Therefore , is talk about full employment a realistic approach to what the future holds , or should we be thinking in terms of how to organise a leisured society ? <p> Stiglitz thinks the effects of automation have been exaggerated . "" The people who are easy to replace are in things such as manufacturing , some kinds of transportation , but the largest sector is the service sector today : teachers , healthcare providers , people who care for the aged . Lots of those services are not going to be quickly replaced . "" <p> At the same time , he 's not a technology optimist . Although in the past technology has created more jobs than it has destroyed , he says there is no reason to believe this trend will continue . His solution is to tax those who become wealthier as a consequence of innovation and redistribute that money to teachers and carers , and spend more money on beautifying cites and retrofitting the economy for climate change . That will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind of radical redistribution was conventional politics . <p> "" For the next 30 years , I see a shortage of labour , not a surplus , "" he says . "" I see so many things that need to be done that the idea that we 'll have a surplus of labour is a little bit of a fantasy . "" <p> That 's exactly it with Stiglitz . He does see so many things that need to be done . And should any of us doubt that they will be done , it 's worth remembering that in Jaws , Dreyfuss and his friends get the shark in the end "" Google is good , but the difference between its search engine and what New Zealand could do on its own is not significant . <p> This article was first published in the July 20 , 2019 issue of the New Zealand Listener ."

"<h> How can the UK Ministry of Defence collaborate with wider Government on innovation ? <p> To help them in their pursuit , the MOD asked PA to study Whitehall 's wider innovation landscape , identify its common themes and highlight where the MOD and Central Government could more closely align . So , how can the MOD collaborate more effectively across Government on innovation , and what are the broader opportunities for Government as a whole ? <p> Collaboration is key to innovation <p> We found the MOD 's approach to innovation to be relatively mature , which is n't a surprise given the operational imperative of the work it does . However , 38 per cent of the people we spoke to around Government said the MOD was n't easy to work with on innovation . <p> Enhanced MOD and Central Government collaboration would generate collective value through rationalised resource investment . This would create an environment for innovation to flourish . As Figure 1 ( below ) shows , there 's a broad , fragmented innovation landscape in Government that would benefit from greater alignment . The expertise exists -- it 's a case of using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government for working with defence on future technology innovation . While the specific technology needs of defence limited collaboration in the past , there are areas of technological overlap available to explore . Central Government 's focus on autonomous vehicles , for example , overlaps with MOD work -- the market might be different , but the technology is similar . The same is true of artificial intelligence ( AI ) and additive manufacturing . <p> Austerity has also driven technology innovation as departments look to reduce costs and meet service delivery requirements . Many are exploring Robotic Process Automation , for example , but a lack of collaboration limits the effectiveness of such initiatives . <p> Few Central Government departments deliver services directly to the public , so they focus on stimulating and facilitating industry innovation . With its engaged military audience , the MOD offers a competitive route to market for these new innovations . <p> Industry innovations around artificial intelligence , cyber security and 5G could all take advantage of this market route . And as the MOD is free from fragmented commissioning arrangements , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Crime Commissioners , it could deliver results efficiently . <p> By aligning the MOD 's innovation challenges with Central Government activities , we could increase exploitation of the industry innovation that other departments are stimulating . Aligning the MOD 's current data analysis and autonomous systems priorities with the Government 's AI Sector Deal is a perfect example . Together , they can work towards an economy that harnesses the power of both AI and big data . <p> 3 . Establish innovation as a function <p> Innovation adoption within Government is a recent development . Of the 33 teams interviewed for this study , most were less than three-years-old . And while many were achieving some success , they were also finding it difficult to create meaningful success metrics and were contending with levels of bureaucracy that stifle innovative behaviours . <p> Elsewhere , traditional processes hinder progress . Finance and commercial operations in the Civil Service are a prime example , with the insistence on in-year budgeting a key challenge to the flexible financing of successful innovation projects . While individual teams are already ' super-charging ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scalable or sustainable . <p> For real change to take root , new approaches need to be embedded . Adopting the ' Lean Start-up ' approach is one antidote to the existing culture -- by installing tools and techniques alongside a think big , start small , scale fast mentality , some have experienced success . These teams are now providing training elsewhere . <p> The importance of senior leadership in this process ca n't be understated . By getting support from senior Civil Service sponsors , the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs succeeded in gaining cross-department engagement when developing Earth observation technology for Copernicus . It 's vital other departments follow suit for success to stick . <p> By encouraging and adopting innovation skills , processes and behaviours into a common innovation approach , Government departments will have the best chance of nurturing an innovation culture . <p> The MOD can facilitate innovation <p> The key to these three solutions lies in one word -- collaboration . Many examples are already scattered across Government , yet Government-wide innovation can only happen through the breaking of silos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can take a key role in enabling this . Through its existing resources and by shedding its non-collaborative image , it can assist in embedding innovation at the very heart of Government . <p> We are over 2,600 specialists in consumer , defence and security , energy and utilities , financial services , government , healthcare , life sciences , manufacturing , and transport , travel and logistics . And we operate globally from offices across the Americas , Europe , the Nordics and the Gulf . <p> Public Sector : Smart Working will give you the chance to hear first hand how public sector organisations have achieved their Smart Working objectives , you 'll get to hear practical examples and learn about the transferable elements that could be replicated in your organisation . <p> Join your colleagues and peers at The Public Sector Customer Experience Conference and discover new and innovative strategies , state-of-the-art tools , techniques and technologies , all designed to assist you in successfully delivering an outstanding customer experience on a"
"<h> New app developed to detect Twitter bots -- in any language <p> South Africa has experienced an upsurge of Twitter bots in recent years , aimed at influencing political discourse and public opinion with seemingly no way to recognise them when they tweet in a language other than English . However , a new tool will allow the detection of these bots , regardless of what language is used . <p> A Twitter bot is a type of software that controls a Twitter account and can autonomously perform actions such as tweeting , re-tweeting , liking , following , unfollowing , and direct messaging . <p> A new application , developed by researchers at the University of Eastern Finland and Linnaeus University in Sweden , is able to detect auto-generated tweets independent of the language used relying on machine learning . <p> Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that uses methods of data analysis to perform a task without using explicit instructions but patterns and inference instead . <p> According to a statement by University of Eastern Finland professor Mikko Laitinen , an estimated 5-10% of Twitter users are bots which account for about 20-25% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instrument in public debate has led to a situation in which it has become an ideal target of spammers and automated scripts , "" Laitinen said in a statement . <p> Laitinen notes that bots are relatively harmless but can also be harmful if they are used to spread fake news .

For instance , we linguists are working together with machine learning specialists . This type of work also calls for determination and investments in research infrastructures that serve as a platform for researchers from different fields to collaborate on , "" Laitinen said . <p> In developing the app , a team of researchers captured 15 000 tweets in Finnish , Swedish and English for analysis . The Finnish and Swedish tweets were mainly used for training of the application , whereas the English tweets were used to evaluate the language independence of the app . <p> According to the statement , the app is able to process "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> An example closer to home of the role of Twitter bots can be seen with the controversial Gupta-Bell Pottinger saga where social media was used to manipulate Twitter users . <p> South African readers will be very familiar with the firm , given its role in pushing a hate-filled propaganda campaign on behalf of the controversial family -- a campaign which would ultimately lead to the firm 's collapse . <p> From January 2016 , Oakbay Investments , a South African company owned by the Guptas , hired the PR firm to manage its reputation and corporate communications . <p> The company -- which once bragged about its ability to "" drown out negative content "" -- created a media campaign focused on reducing criticism of the Gupta family and their alleged connection to former president Jacob Zuma .

South African born Musk has quite a few accolades to his name in his early years as an entrepreneur . He developed the web 's first yellow pages called Zip2 and online financial company X.com that was later renamed to PayPal . Now Musk is popularly known as the man behind Space X , Tesla Motors , Open AI , SolarCity , Hyperloop and the latest ' Boring Company ' . Here are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are looking at technology in this word : <h> Space X <p> Elon Musk founded Space X ( Space Exploration Technologies ) , a company that develops and manufactures outer-space launch vehicles and focuses on advancing the state of rocket technology . <p> Musk 's agenda was to make space travel more affordable and Space X pulled it off by signing a $1.6 billion contract with NASA for resupplying the International Space Station ( ISS ) , becoming one of the first private companies to replace the space-shuttle . According to Inc . Space X has been able to reduce the cost of reaching the ISS by 90% , from $1 billion to $60 million . <p> Space X has also launched and re-landed several orbital rockets since 2015 and last year it re-landed an autonomous spaceport drone ship marking it as one the first by a private company . The company 's Dragon spacecraft is also one of the first commercial vehicle to attach to the ISS and also the first to ever recover a spacecraft from Earth 's orbit . Going forward , Musk plans to launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next 10-20 years . <h> Tesla Motors <p> Musk heavily invested in Tesla Motors and joined as the Chairman in 2004 after leading the Series A funding round for the company . The company was dedicated to building affordable , mass-market electric cars and in 2008 , unveiled the Roadster , the first electric sports car that was able to travel 250 miles on a single charge . <p> Musk became the CEO of the company after the 2008 recession and has held the position till date . The company has also produced an electric luxury sedan Model S , which ranks as the world 's all-time second best-selling electric plug-in vehicle , Model X , which is a crossover SUV and Model 3 which Tesla Unveiled last year and will release in 2017 with a price tag of $35,000 .

Evidence of police witnesses can not be discarded merely on the ground that they belong to police force and interested in the investigation and their desire to see the success of the case .

Mere fact that they are police officials does not by itself give rise to any doubt about their creditworthiness . "" <p> The bench , in this case ( Kripal Singh vs . State of Rajasthan ) , observed : "" The submission of the learned senior counsel for the appellant that recovery has not been proved by any independent witness is of no substance for the reason that in the absence of independent witness to support the recovery in substance can not be ignored unless proved to the contrary .

"<p> Big data . It 's one of the tech cliches of the age . The idea that the torrent of data now being created can be processed in all sorts of clever ways with life-changing implications . <p> On my Tech Tent podcast this week , we look at the promise and perils of data and ask whether we are ready to share more of it with companies that say they will use it for our benefit . <h> Google : Good for your health ? <p> This week , we heard of a massive data partnership between a technology company and the Britain 's National Health Service . The idea is that London 's Royal Free Hospital will share data from two and a half million patients with DeepMind - Google 's artificial intelligence business . <p> It will use the data to develop an app , which will help doctors and nurses monitor the condition of patients more quickly . The hospital says this could save lives . <p> But not everybody is happy about this deal . Some have questioned the circumstances under which this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology company . Among them is Julia Powles , who works on technology law and policy at Cambridge University . She 's concerned that the health service has struck a deal with Google , which has no experience in healthcare , and asks whether we would be comfortable if a similar arrangement was made with a drugs company . <p> DeepMind 's co-founder Mustafa Suleyman tells us that the company has showed unprecedented levels of transparency in publishing the contracts it has with hospitals . He insists that doctors and nurses approached DeepMind with the idea for the app - and that the data can not be used for any other purpose than improving the care of patients . <h> Driverless cars : Who 's in charge ? <p> Here 's another data dilemma - do you want your car to hand over information to your insurance company if you have an accident ? As we move towards driverless vehicles , the insurance industry has a big concern : what happens when something goes wrong ?

Dave Lee has been to Green Bank in the middle of the US Radio Quiet Zone , a special area where tight restrictions are placed on technology . <p> That means no mobile phones and no wi-fi - both would disrupt the operation of the Green Bank Telescope . This colossal instrument listens out for sounds deep in our universe . If aliens are out there , this thing will hear them first . Because it is so disconnected from modern communications , the town has become a hub for people convinced they have an adverse reaction to cellular transmissions and other interference . <p> Now though , there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the US government decided it could no longer afford to maintain the telescope ."
"<p> Technology has changed the way people learn . From massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) to virtual classrooms such as Blackboard and on-demand video tutors , education technology ( edtech ) has emerged as a rapidly growing sector , especially in Asia . It has also attracted a lot of investor interest . <p> "" The promise of edtech has been there for a long time . But I think in the last two years , the sector has been getting attention and it is turning into real opportunities , "" says GV Ravishankar , managing director of Sequoia Capital in India , who has several investments in edtech firms in Asia . <p> Edtech refers to technology that is used to develop tools for the education sector . For example , it could be in the form of classroom management software that enables virtual classrooms , interactive apps that educate users on various topics or platforms that connect tutors and students virtually . <p> The recent boom in Asia is driven by factors such as the growing mobile penetration rate , affordable internet access , willingness by parents to pay for education and a strong demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investee companies is BYJU 'S , an Indian edtech that is attempting to fill the gap left by a lack of good teachers . It offers students a personalised learning journey into subjects such as maths and science via online videos , animations and illustrations in a mobile app . <p> Sequoia also has an investment in Edusys , which provides professional certification and test preparation courses in online , classroom and hybrid formats . "" We are quite bullish on the trend because we are seeing consumers adapt to online learning models quickly . The younger generation is very comfortable learning online . So , from our perspective , we think the market is ripe for investments , "" says Ravishankar . <p> Jeffrey Paine , managing partner of Golden Gate Ventures ( GGV ) , sees the edtech sector as a relatively new segment . Investors must choose carefully , depending on the country and target market , whose needs may differ widely . GGV is invested in KooBits , a Singapore-based edtech firm that teaches math online . <p> "" China is leading the way with edtech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universities , whereas India tends to have a bit more video-based learning and a lot of focus on K-12 kindergarten to 12th grade maths and science , "" says Paine . <p> "" In Southeast Asia , Vietnam is growing fast , from K-12 content and corporate training on how to use Microsoft Excel to online video-based English tutoring . In Malaysia , one example is a company called EduAdvisor , which helps inform people who are going overseas to apply for schools . "" <p> EduAdvisor has received venture capital funding from 500 Startups and the KK Fund , according to Pitchbook , a US-based data provider in the areas of venture capital , private equity and mergers and acquisitions . <p> According to a 2016 report by UK-based consultancy IBIS Capital , the edtech market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 17% to US$252 billion in 2020 globally . While the US previously led the pack , Asia is currently experiencing the fastest growth in investments in the sector , going from 46% of the global market to 54% . <p> This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Pitchbook , the biggest edtech venture capital deals had been found in Greater China in the past five years . Three of the top five edtech investments since 2012 have also been in the country . <p> This has led to the birth of several edtech unicorns , including VIPKid and Yuanfudao . The former is an online English learning platform while the latter is a homework assistance app . Users can take a picture of their arithmetic homework , for instance , and the app will use artificial intelligence to check the answers . <p> India has an edtech unicorn in BYJU 'S , which received Chan Zuckerberg Initiative 's first investment outside of the US . Some of the big players in Indonesia and Vietnam are Ruangguru , a marketplace for private tutoring , and Topica Edtech Group , whose offerings include live English tutoring and bachelor 's degree programmes online . <p> Ravishankar believes that the edtech trend is being driven by the prevalence of computing and smartphones in the hands of end-consumers . "" For example , a huge population in India began to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the first time they are experiencing the internet . That has allowed many companies to reach out to hundreds of millions of people and it enables consumers to experience the power of education through technology , "" he says . <p> The other major factor driving edtech investments in Asia is the high value that parents attach to education . This results in a greater willingness to pay for education in markets such as China , India and Southeast Asia . <p> "" Perhaps this goes back to the market structure some of these countries have . In the US , most people go to public schools , which have delivered reasonably good quality education . That is why people there are not as used to paying for education . But in China and India , people are willing to pay so their children can find jobs . In India , education is seen as a way of getting out of poverty and getting a well-paying job , "" says Ravishankar . <p> This means the kinds of edtech companies serving Asian and Western countries are different . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school districts whereas in Asia , they may target parents . <p> "" We have seen an example in China in the form of VIPKid . It has a very interesting model of teaching English to Chinese students through teachers who are in the US . It leverages the language advantage that English-speaking countries have to teach students in China , where there is a huge demand to learn English . That is possible because high-quality internet access is widely available , "" says Ravishankar . <p> Opportunities in edtech <p> Edtech companies with the most potential for growth tend to be those that serve consumers directly or provide content that supplements the school curriculum . "" That is because there are so many students in that age group and younger people are more comfortable with technology , "" says Ravishankar . <p> This is especially true for subjects such as English and maths , the mastery of which can boost the chances of a child getting a good job in the future . There are many popular edtech companies in the region targeting those who want to learn English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Academia in Thailand . <p> "" In Singapore and Malaysia , students learn from courses provided by edtech companies just like they would by going for offline tuition classes . You have to take your SPM , so you need to go for tuition classes where they teach you how to pass your exam , "" says Paine . <p> "" The services provided by these companies may be homework-driven . It could be that I am stuck doing my homework and I need a social network to teach me how to solve problems . It could be a live video tutoring session or online curriculum . "" <p> GGV invested in KooBits because of its track record over the years . The latter is now used by students in countries such as the Philippines and Indonesia . The reputation of the Singaporean maths curriculum -- which has been ranked the best in the world by some international agencies -- has increased the attractiveness of the company in the eyes of its potential customers . <p> There are also opportunities in the working adults segment , a group that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for these services . Sequoia invested in India-based Eruditus , which partners Ivy League Schools in the US and top universities in the UK to offer online courses for professionals . <p> "" It Eruditus puts some of its undergraduate education programmes online . This is for professionals who want to learn things such as data science or the new generation of technology tools that are impacting management today , "" says Ravishankar . <p> While this idea is not new -- it was popularised through MOOCs run by those like Coursera and Khan Academy -- a new set of players , such as Eruditus , have changed the game for this sub-segment of providers , says Ravishankar . Users learn online together in a virtual class , listening to the same teacher in the same time period . They have projects , group work and online discussion sessions . <p> "" It is an online application of the offline student environment . I think they have created models that allow for substantially higher completion rates compared with MOOCs because this creates familiarity among the cohort . These companies came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimistic about what that means for edtech and higher education , "" says Ravishankar . <p> Edtech companies in Asia face a few common challenges . One of them is gaining the trust of users . Second , the cost of acquiring customers can be quite high because of the online competition for users . <p> The business-to-consumer market is where the future of edtech is , in Ravishankar 's view . That is because business-to-business edtech companies face challenges in selling their solutions . "" That model has been traditionally hard to scale because you have school networks that are highly disorganised . Selling to them and collecting money from them have been tough , "" he says . <p> Impact investing in edtech companies <p> There is an impact investing story in education technology ( edtech ) . There are edtech companies that address specific social issues or problems , such as student loans or lack of access to quality education among certain populations . <p> For instance , P Ming Wong , co-founder of Giinseng , an impact investing membership-based community in Hong Kong , was personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The company has created gaming technology solutions aimed at helping children with **31;177;TOOLONG disorder ( ADHD ) . <p> "" It was an opportunity to invest in a company that is helping children who have difficulty concentrating overcome that issue , so they can become better learners . It was doing this in an innovative manner , "" says Wong . <p> "" At the time , the usual treatment for children with these issues was either a visit to a doctor who puts you through a tedious process of learning , where you have to stare at different charts , or take medication that has side effects . "" <p> As an impact investor , Wong likes the technology angle in the education sector because it can bring scale to solutions . "" Khan Academy was successful because for the first time , it made learning available through the use of videos . The teaching itself is not innovative , but the ability to watch a video over and over again on a free platform made it easily accessible . The technology platform allows it to be used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest lies in edtech companies that are addressing a particular underserved segment . "" In most cases , it is to overcome the shortage of well-qualified teachers , particularly in developing countries and rural areas , "" he says . <p> Wong cites US-based Enuma Inc as an example of an edtech company he finds interesting . It was founded by a couple whose son was born with special needs . They began designing games and applications that could help all children -- including those with special needs or who lack access to education -- to learn independently . <p> "" A lot of companies come up with different ways to teach English and maths on the internet and via mobile devices . But Enuma was the first to develop it under an open source situation , where it makes the code freely available to anyone who wants it . All people need to do is modify it for local consumption , "" says Wong . <p> Enuma also participated in the Global Learning XPrize competition , where it had to conduct a pilot and demonstrate its effectiveness . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes that for edtech to really improve the lives of many , the founders must work with the public sector , whether through schools or civil society , to understand the crux of the problem faced by the underserved community . "" They must be willing to invest the time and energy to design solutions for the underserved communities -- that is the Holy Grail . There are many school teachers and non-profit organisations out there trying to solve the education problem . So , seek to collaborate , "" he says ."
"<p> Buildings more likely to be targeted by terrorists could be required by law to ramp up security measures - a move that has been described as "" timely "" but which has led to concerns about funding . <p> The Infrastructure Protection Bill , if enacted , will allow the Ministry of Home Affairs ( MHA ) to designate new buildings as "" special developments "" and existing buildings as "" special infrastructures "" . <p> The proposed law was introduced in Parliament on Monday by Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo and will be debated at the next sitting . <p> New buildings have to integrate security measures as part of their design before they are constructed .

"<h> Companies Will Spend $50 Billion On Artificial Intelligence This Year With Little To Show For It <p> After spending $2.5 billion over five years , Uber is still far from delivering its self-driving vehicles . <p> AFP via Getty Images <p> As corporate spending on artificial intelligence systems is set to pass $50 billion this year , the vast majority of companies may not be seeing much return on that record investment . <p> In a survey of more than 3,000 company managers about their AI spend , only 10% reported significant financial benefits from their investment so far , the new report from MIT Sloan Management Review and Boston Consulting Group found . <p> Gains from the tech have n't kept pace with increased adoption , says Shervin Khodabandeh , who led the study and is co-head of BCG 's AI business in North America .

By 2024 , investment is expected to reach $110 billion , IDC forecasts . <p> But despite the billions invested , failed AI projects have become an increasing factor . IBM has deprioritized its Watson technology after drawing scorn for ventures like one $62 million oncology project that made inaccurate suggestions on cancer treatments .

"<h> China steps up pace in new nuclear arms race with US and Russia as experts warn of rising risk of conflict <p> China steps up pace in new nuclear arms race with US and Russia as experts warn of rising risk of conflict <p> China is aggressively developing its next generation of nuclear weapons , conducting an average of five tests a month to simulate nuclear blasts , according to a major Chinese weapons research institute . <p> Its number of simulated tests has in recent years outpaced that of the United States , which conducts them less than once a month on average . <p> Between September 2014 and last December , China carried out around 200 laboratory experiments to simulate the extreme physics of a nuclear blast , the China Academy of Engineering Physics reported in a document released by the government earlier this year and reviewed by the South China Morning Post this month . <p> In comparison , the US carried out only 50 such tests between 2012 and 2017 -- or about 10 a year -- according to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory . <p> As China joins the US and Russia in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threats , the looming arms race would in fact serve the opposite purpose by increasing the risk of a nuclear conflict , experts warn . <p> Pentagon officials have said the US wants its enemies to believe it might actually use its new-generation weapons , such as smaller , smarter tactical warheads designed to limit damage by destroying only specific targets . <p> View photos <p> But with these relatively safer and less destructive weapons in hand , governments may end up losing the inhibition to use them . <p> "" The use of small warheads will lead to the use of bigger ones , "" Beijing-based naval expert Li Jie told the Post . <p> Still , despite China being highly unlikely to actually deploy its nuclear weapons , it remained necessary to develop them , he said . <p> "" If other countries use nuclear weapons on us , we have to retaliate .

Earlier this year , the Pentagon announced it would develop new low-yield nuclear weapons that could be mounted on conventional cruise missiles and launched by submarines . <p> These developments were a response to Russia 's actions , according to Lewis . <p> View photos <p> The Russian government under Vladimir Putin has in recent years revealed a series of new nuclear weapon programmes , including smaller weapons , as well as a super torpedo capable of wiping out coastal cities . <p> "" It 's not clear to me how successful the Russian programme will be , but it has stirred everyone up on the subject , "" Lewis said . <p> US officials have said they want America 's nuclear arsenal to be a "" credible "" deterrent to the use of tactical nuclear weapons . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrations to discuss the possibility of using nuclear weapons -- most notoriously in the president 's own rhetoric such as the threat to unleash "" fire and fury "" on North Korea . <p> "" After some debate , the US decided it needed to think about warheads , without the need for actual tests , "" Lewis said . "" It would n't surprise me if China saw all this and decided that it had better get in the game .

"<h> Chip giants pelt embedded AI platforms with wads of cash <h> Shift from supercomputer to mobile continues <p> Analysis Artificial intelligence and machine learning engines are underpinning many emerging applications and services , from making sense of big data for enterprises , to supporting hyper-personalized consumer content , or virtual reality gaming . <p> The current challenge is to move AI from the supercomputer to the mobile device , supporting technologies like computer vision locally on the handset , car , camera or VR headset . <p> Qualcomm has been a leader here , but the past weeks have seen Intel and its Chinese partner Rockchip invest in chip-level computer vision and AI capabilities , while Apple has acquired machine learning startup Turi , presumably to enhance its AI-driven personal assistant Siri . <h> Rockchip licenses CEVA XM4 <p> Rockchip has licensed the XM4 imaging and vision DSP ( digital signal processor ) design from IP provider CEVA , to enhance these aspects of its system-on-chip ( SoC ) products . It says it will enable advanced vision features at the low power levels required for mobile devices , supporting digital video stabilization , object detection and tracking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockchip 's CMO , Feng Chen , said in a statement that the firm wanted to "" embrace the potential of computational photography , computer vision and machine learning in our product designs , seamlessly handling even the most complex use cases and algorithms "" . <p> This is not just about vision -- the XM4 also targets augmented reality , advanced driver assistance systems ( ADAS ) and other applications , offloading these computationally intensive tasks from the CPU or GPU ; and it will enable Rockchip to use the machine learning capabilities of CEVA 's Deep Neural Network ( CDNN2 ) framework . <h> Intel buys Nervana <p> Intel , which is an investor in Rockchip , has AI ambitions of its own , many focused on the massive cloud platforms which will boost its core server chip business , but it is also investing heavily in client-side capabilities such as intelligent assistants ( increasingly a key interface to the smart home and car ) and virtual reality . <p> It is spending $400m to acquire AI start-up Nervana , which should be particularly valuable for its work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new partnership with BMW and Mobileye focused on driverless vehicles , with Mobileye providing the detection capabilities . Nervana could add a far greater level of intelligence or "" brainpower "" to the car platform . <p> But Intel 's bigger agenda , as EETimes points out , is likely to be to sideline the GPU ( graphics processor unit ) as the workhorse of ma-chine learning platforms . Nvidia has stolen a march on Intel in high end GPUs , threatening the larger firm 's incumbency in supercomputers . If the move away from GPUs and towards specialized processors , for AI , accelerates , it will benefit Intel . <p> Nervana has already mounted a credible challenge to Nvidia 's CUDA software , which powers its GPUs , with its own Neon cloud service ( which is CUDA-compatible ) . And it has its own deep learning accelerator chip on the drawing board , and set to launch next year . <p> Both these offerings could gain far greater power with Intel behind them , and could enable the US giant to offer AI accelerate boards to challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CUDA too . Intel will incorporate Nervana 's algorithms into its Math Kernel Library for integration with its industry standard frameworks , and it can add Nvidia-compatible deep learning to its portfolio of cloud services . <p> The upcoming Nervana chip , called Engine , promises an 8Tbps multichip module with terabytes of 3D memory surrounding a 3D fabric of connected neurons , each using low precision floating point units ( FPUs ) . This design enables it to conduct far more deep learning calculations-per-second on a smaller chip than general purpose GPUs , says the firm . <p> Karl Freund , senior analyst for at Moor Insights &amp; Strategy , told EETimes : "" GPUs are the prominent way to train deep learning neural networks and Nvidia is the leader . Intel has its multicore Xeons and Xeon Phi and with the acquisition of Altera , its FPGAs , but it does n't have GPUs . Acquiring Nervana is a way of getting into the deep learning market not by copying the general purpose GPU strategy , but by offering a specialized coprocessor specifically designed for neural networks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chips being deployed from supercomputers to cars to handsets , the competition will only heat up , and Nvidia may respond with its own offering . At the mobile end , Qualcomm has been highly active in this area with its Zeroth machine learning platform , which can be embedded in the Snapdragon SoC . <p> Initially , Qualcomm 's Zeroth/Snapdragon work focused on bringing AI algorithms and vision processing to cars , but many other applications are in its sights , as highlighted by its recently announced deep learning software developers ' kit ( SDK ) for the Snapdragon 820 SoC . <p> Called the Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine , the SDK is an attempt by Qualcomm to expand beyond its core smartphone markets -- by enticing automotive , industrial , and IoT developers to its Snapdragon platform . It also sees the chip supplier looking for broader market reach , and accelerated uptake , by enabling a great deal of its brain-like functionality in software . <p> Back in May 2014 , when Qualcomm first introduced the Zeroth project , the goal was to build a neural processing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its advanced SoCs . But dedicated hardware not only adds to cost and power consumption for mobile devices , but raises barriers to developer support . <p> So the new SDK for the neuromorphic Zeroth Machine Intelligence Platform -- Qualcomm 's equivalent of IBM 's TrueNorth chip -- aims to bring the hardware-specific functions of these brain chips to a more general purpose Snapdragon platform . This will help mobile devices to leverage the potential of silicon that acts in a manner somewhat akin to the human brain . <p> While IBM is planning on shipping its brain chips to end-customers , who will put them to use in servers , the Qualcomm approach relies on software to bring those capabilities to a far more adaptable chipset -- one that can be used in mobile devices , industrial IoT endpoints and vehicles . <h> Apple makes latest AI-related acquisition <p> The makers of those endpoints and devices will also be taking a keen interest . Apple has made its latest AI-related acquisition , paying $200m for machine learning startup Turi . <p> Turi offers tools for developers to embed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Use cases for the technology include product recommendations , sentiment analysis and churn prediction . <p> It is not yet clear whether these capabilities will be used for in-house developments or made available to iOS developers , but Apple CEO Tim Cook has identified AI as a key way to improve the customer experience of the firm 's devices and software -- and of course , it is vital for Apple to continue to lead in user experience and keep customers as addicted to its home , auto and IoT offerings as they are to its phones . It seems likely that Turi 's ability to analyse sentiment could be harnessed to improve Siri 's intelligence and responsiveness , extending it beyond the startup 's current fairly basic applications . <p> On the company 's most recent earnings call , Cook said : "" These experiences become more powerful and intuitive as we continue our long history of enriching our products through advanced artificial intelligence . We have focused our AI efforts on the features that best enhance the customer experience . "" <p> During the briefing , Cook highlighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the user , but also identify the sentiment .

"<h> Police departments want to link this to Aadhaar to widen the dragnet . <p> Google Play/ PAISThe PAIS app uses AI to identify people . As a security measure , it can only be used with an OTP delivered to a pre-registered phone number . <p> DEHRADUN , Uttarakhand -- When the Punjab Police 's Organised Crime Control Unit ( OCCU ) stormed a hotel room in Tarn Taran district last year to bust a drug deal , one suspect got away . <p> But a photograph from a phone recovered from the scene was enough to track him down . <p> "" We looked at their phones , we saw a photo -- a group selfie they had clicked , "" said Nilabh Kishore , Deputy Inspector General of the Indo Tibetan Border Police ( ITBP ) , who was formerly in charge of OCCU . <p> Kishore 's team cropped out the image of the missing man and ran it through the Punjab Artificial Intelligence System ( PAIS ) , which uses an artificial-intelligence assisted face-recognition algorithm to match any photograph against an ever-expanding database of over 100,000 criminal records maintained by the state police . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kishore said , helped the police track down Vicky Gounder , an alleged gangster who was shot dead by the police earlier this year . <p> "" The criminals are shaken up now , "" Kishore said .

PAIS , for instance , was created by Gurgaon-based Staqu , a software company which began as an AI image recognition service for e-commerce companies , before branching out into law enforcement . <p> Resource-strapped investigators say these tools have made it easier to track dangerous suspects , make connections between gang members and control crime .

In July this year , the Union cabinet also proposed a bill that allows for the creation of a national DNA database . <p> Yet , much like the controversial Aadhaar programme , so-called "" smart policing "" is on the rise with little public scrutiny of what this means for the rights and liberties of citizens . Experts worry that policing technology such as face recognition , which has serious implications for the privacy and freedom of citizens , remains largely untested . <p> "" As these tools are proprietary , we can never have access to the source code . There are no impact assessment studies , "" said Mishi Choudhary , managing partner , Mishi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . "" We or the police have no way to assess the risks of biased data or faulty prediction systems that these may be . I see a feedback loop where police keeps going back to the same people . "" <p> The consequences of handing such technology to India 's notoriously poorly trained policemen could be devastating , analysts say . <p> "" Databasing is a very potent and dangerous exercise because without context , quantitative data can mean anything and everything , "" said Noopur Raval , a PhD candidate in Informatics at the University of California , Irvine , and formerly an affiliate at the Berkman-Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University . "" Datafication , or these dashboard fantasies , can draw a very wrong picture .

We purchased just about 30 phones and used them to snap pictures of all new people coming in , and also from the people who were already in jail , "" he explained . "" So when they would take the photos , they would also enter the data on the phone right there , and most of it is menus and lists so you can quickly fill up the information without having to sit on a computer and type for a long time .

Then you have to do investigation to figure out who the person really is , but in my experience , the correct person has always been one of the top four suggestions in the app , "" said Kishore . <p> The ambiguity of face-recognition technology , and its outsized claims , has prompted questions from civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberties Union compared photographs of members of the US Congress with 25,000 mug shots of criminals using Rekognition , a face recognition software Amazon is pitching to law enforcement agencies in the US .

"" People of colour are already disproportionately harmed by police practices , and it 's easy to see how Rekognition could exacerbate that . "" <p> ACLU <p> The bias in AI systems comes from the training data . In the case of Staqu 's software , the company used publicly available images to ' teach ' the AI what a human face looks like .

"<p> Following a challenging 2017 , the South African insurance industry must adopt technology and collaborate with local governments , if it is to effectively tap into new markets to stimulate growth for the foreseeable future . <p> Many sectors have been very quick in adopting new technology , like the financial services industry , who have been at the forefront of technological innovation . It is time the insurance sector does the same . <p> Luckily , we have seen certain pockets in the insurance industry follow suit , such as Lemonade , who launched an AI claims bot . It has the potential to investigate and approve a personal lines claim in a record , yes wait for it , 3 seconds ! This is a giant leap for the insurance industry . Proper use of technology will vastly improve customer experience . It will also allow insurers to properly assess a client 's exposure , underwrite and price it appropriately . <p> To stay relevant , insurers must adopt technology and redefine their market .

Our industry needs a concerted effort to provide every single South African access to affordable insurance . <p> This wo n't be easy . The industry faces many challenges in 2018 which needs to be attended to . They are : <p> Changes in regulation <p> There are many expected changes to local regulation that will have significant effects on the insurance industry . These include the Retail Distribution Review ( RDR ) , Policy Protection Rules ( PPR ) , Protection of Personal Information ( PoPI ) and Treating Customers Fairly ( TCF ) . <p> Much has been said about these changes , suffice to say Insurers need to properly understand the impact of these changes and ensure they have systems and processes in place to properly manage these changes . <p> The effects of Climate Change <p> Insurers need to prepare for more frequent and more severe weather incidents . This could be as varied as more severe hailstorms in certain regions and more droughts in other . Insurers need to properly understand the impact of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed firefighting systems may not work properly anymore . <p> Staying ahead of technological innovation <p> Technology is a key enabler for insurers . Robotics could reduce time spend on mundane tasks and artificial intelligence could enhance decision making , but at the same time , cybercrime is on the rise . Insurers struggle to come to grips with technology that is developing faster than they can cope ; drones , cybercrime and driverless cars are just a few developments insurers need to internalise and understand . <p> Attracting millennials <p> There are indications that millennials now outnumber other working generations . However , there are very few insurance products that actually cater to their needs . The way insurance is sold , is also not fully aligned with their needs . <p> The retention of technical skills <p> The insurance industry has been losing its technical skills at a rapid pace .

"<p> JOHANNESBURG ? ? "" This week South Africa and Africa are hosting world leaders in the information and communication technologies sector in partnership with the UN ? ? ? s International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) and the private sector at the 2018 ITU Telecoms World in Durban . <p> We have embraced this opportunity because it ensures that Africa ? ? ? s voice is heard in the important technology discussions , which include preparations for 5G networks , impact and ownership of artificial intelligence , cybersecurity and the risks and opportunities of a smarter world . <p> These are important discussions because Africa can not afford to be left behind in the global economy . We also need to ensure that small businesses can give the continent a great lever in the development of local solutions to our challenges , thereby localising the digital economy . <p> ITU Telecoms World was addressed by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday , bringing hope of a new digital dawn for the country , Africa and the world . He emphasised once more that we should take advantage of the rapid technological developments to help our countries achieve the UN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all humanity . <p> ITU Telecoms World has invited about 50 African and South African small businesses to partner with other entrepreneurs and seek potential investment . They are showcasing their ICT capabilities this week while forging deeper partnerships and staying abreast with global ICT best practices . It is clear we need collaboration to achieve our goals much faster . This collaboration in the digital sphere has to be with governments , regulators , private sector , labour and academia . As South Africa , we are hosting this conference with the sponsorship of the private sector . <p> Collaboration will also help us to define Africa ? ? ? s strategy in relation to data , which is evidently the fuel that propels the digital economy . Our collective decisions and actions will determine if we are to become slaves or masters of our own destiny in the digital economy . Decisions we make about data should support localisation of the digital economy . <p> In South Africa , we have the e-government strategy , which is our guide for digital transformation and modernising our public service departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable the government to offer more online services . <p> Another area of focus should be collaboration in connecting the people who remain off-line . The Smart Africa Initiative has resolved to launch the One Africa Network , which is aligned to modern thinking in the rollout of infrastructure as the continent strives to connect her unconnected citizens . <p> Training people in digital skills is as important as rolling out infrastructure to cover everyone . In this regard , African countries are rolling out the Internet-for-All programme which focuses on the provision of digital skills , localisation of the internet content and manufacturing and the rollout of infrastructure . Some private sector companies are partnering with African countries to scale-up digital skills training . <p> The ITU conference is coming to South Africa as we are preparing to host the Investment Summit in October . It therefore offers an excellent opportunity to attract investment from ICT investors . South Africa is indeed open for business . <p> Dr Siyabonga Cwele is Minister of Telecommunications and Postal Services . <p> The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent @ @ @ @ How will my divorce affect my kids ? <p> Most children adjust well to parental separation and divorce , at least in the long term . <p> A minority of children of separated parents have long-term problems , which can affect them through their childhood and into adult life . But it ? ? ? s conflict between separated parents , and not the separation itself , which accounts for many of the problems children of separated parents experience . <p> Immediately before and after parental separation , children are often upset . But for most children , their adjustment improves across the next year or two . Studies show most children adjust reasonably well in the longer term . <p> On average , children of separated parents do just a little bit worse than children of parents in intact families . This effect is evident across multiple outcomes . For example , children of divorce do a little bit worse on educational attainment , have slightly more behaviour problems , and are slightly more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression . <p> While the average effect of parental separation is small , children of separated parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substance abuse , and are twice as likely to attempt suicide , as children of parents in intact families . These statistics reflect that a minority of children from separated parents have very poor adjustment . <h> Witnessing conflict <p> The strongest predictor of poor child adjustment after separation is conflict between the separated parents . Poor long-term outcomes for children occur when parental conflict is severe ( such as verbal abuse or physical violence ) , is frequent , and occurs in front of the child . <p> Children are particularly affected when the conflict is about them , or issues around parenting . Many children blame themselves for parental conflict , particularly when the conflict is about parenting or child behaviour . If the child believes they have caused the conflict , or should be able to stop the conflict , then they are particularly likely to suffer adjustment problems . <p> Severe parental conflict in front of the children is also associated with child adjustment problems in intact families . In high conflict parental relationships , separation sometimes reduces children ? ? ? s exposure to parental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect children from parental conflict . <p> As well as parental conflict , poor child adjustment is predicted by mental health or substance abuse problems in a parent . Many separated parents re-partner and these new relationships sometimes end . Frequent changes in the child ? ? ? s living arrangements , and changes in who cares for the children , are also associated with poor child adjustment . <h> Co-parenting after divorce <p> When parents separate there has to be an agreement about how the children will be cared for . Agreements have to address issues such as where the child will live , how much time each parent will spend with the child , and how and where the parents will communicate about parenting decisions . <p> About 30% of separating parents reach a co-parenting agreement without assistance . Another 30% seek advice from professionals such as family lawyers , psychologists , or family counsellors , and then negotiate an agreement acceptable to both parents . But about 40% of separated parents have disagreement about parenting arrangements they ? ? ? re unable to resolve . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to undertake mediation . If mediation does not produce an agreement , then the parents can apply to the Family Court to make a decision . In some circumstances , the parents can go straight to court without having to attempt mediation . Examples of such circumstances are if there is family violence , or if one of the parents has a mental health problem that is seen to make mediation inappropriate . <p> Family mediation usually involves four or five hours of sessions with a professional mediator . Typically the mediator conducts a separate individual interview with each parent to assess the family background , and identify the current issues of dispute around parenting . There might also be a session talking with the child or children asking them their views . Then there would be a conjoint session between the mediator and the two parents . <p> Of separated parents who undertake mediation , about two-thirds reach a co-parenting agreement . The remaining third usually go to the Family Court to have a judge or magistrate determine what the parenting arrangements will be ."

"<p> In . NET 5 Preview 7 , Microsoft has now introduced another floating-point datatype alongside the standard Float and Double . Dubbed Half , the new datatype is equivalent to binary16 , which is specified in the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic . <p> Unlike Float and Double in C# , which occupy 32 bits and 64 bits respectively , Half will be based on 16 bits . These bits will be split as follows : one sign bit , five exponent bits , and 10 mantissa bits . Taken together , Half can represent and store values in the range ? 65504 . This decrease in precision is where the datatype gets its name from in the first place . One rather strange implication of this format is that a Half can store both positive zero and negative zero : <p> 1 00000 0000000000 = -0 <p> 0 00000 0000000000 = +0 <p> Computations in machine learning take advantage of the decreased precision to speed up calculations and cut down on storage space . So , this would probably be the primary use case for a Half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Half using a Float or Double , but the inverse wo n't be true without a loss of precision since you will be transitioning to lesser bits . Moreover , it is to be noted that : <p> In . NET 5.0 , the Half type is primarily an interchange type with no arithmetic operators defined on it . It only supports parsing , formatting and comparison operators . All arithmetic operations will need an explicit conversion to a float/double . Future versions will consider adding arithmetic operators directly on Half . <p> It is expected that the Half will find its way into many codebases and will soon be supported in C# as a half datatype as it promises faster computation and efficiency in ML workflows .

"<p> Employers in Singapore may tighten their salary budgets this year , only possibly offering new hires a 5% to 10% salary increment . <p> At the same time , despite a more optimistic labour outlook for Asian markets as compared to the European and American markets , candidates in Singapore are expected to have a much lower risk appetite this year . <p> According to Randstad 's 2020 Market Outlook -- Singapore , while employees are still interested in factors such as growth opportunities and better compensation packages , they are likely to be more concerned about job security and an organisation 's financial stability , given current economic uncertainties . <p> Apart from the above , any hiring of replacement headcount due to attrition is likely to slow down this year , with certain roles and functions being absorbed into existing teams . This would help keep manpower costs low , while driving higher efficiencies . <p> That said , companies will reserve any large-scale investments for critical roles and digital transformation initiatives , particularly for projects that can account for immediate costs savings and revenue generation . <p> Overall , the report presented the most in-demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , manufacturing &amp; supply chain , and FMCG &amp; retail . <h> Most in-demand skills and job roles in fintech <p> In 2020 , mid-level professionals in banking are more likely to switch over to fintech , especially those who do not see any lateral opportunities or career growth in the next 12 months . <p> When hiring such talent , fintech firms are seen to prefer those with at least five years of working experience , as they would have a deeper understanding of the Monetary Authority of Singapore ( MAS ) ' s regulations and fail-proof workflows , which can help firms drive commercial expansion . <p> More importantly , with rising competition in the areas of payments , deposits , investments , e-wallets and SME lending , fintech firms will increasingly look for talent in product sales and relationship management . As firms expand their operations to other ASEAN markets , candidates whohave experience working in a regional remit will be highly sought-after . <p> Given the above , there is still a lack of talent with the skills to work in an industry such as fintech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more on their transferable skills and culture fit , instead of focusing solely on past working experience . <p> Further down the journey , fintech firms are encouraged to meet this shortfall of skills and high talent demand with a solid onboarding plan , and training &amp; development programmes to help their new hires better integrate into the new environment . <h> A more "" progressive "" approach to compensation packages in fintechs <p> Fintechs are gradually moving away from the traditional method of remuneration -- which is typically a pay hike that is calculated based on a percentage from their last drawn salary . Instead , they are taking on a more progressive approach when designing their compensation packages , the report found . <p> For instance , larger and more established players are able to offer benefits that match market standards , while start-ups , on the other hand , might take a more radical approach -- by offering unlimited leave , for example . <p> This , however , does not mean a less competitive pay package in the industry . Employers are still willing to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the company . <p> On the banking and financial services front , there is still a traditional take on salaries . While it is highly dependent on the responsibilities of the role , the salary increase usually ranges between 10% and 20% -- consistent with what banks are offering . This would typically be split between the commission and base salary for revenue-generating roles . <p> Some senior-level professionals may also receive equity as part of their remuneration packages , especially if they are highly pursued by young start-ups . <h> Most in-demand skills and job roles in manufacturing &amp; supply chain <p> As a result of a relatively muted supply and demand market observed in 2019 , companies are likely to be risk-averse in 2020 . <p> Following this , hiring activities have slowed down in 2019 , and is expected to continue through to the end of 2020 if the market does not pick up . Further , there will be fewer newly-created roles within the industry , with companies only hiring for replacement or contract roles , instead of new headcounts . <p> In line with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R&amp;D this year , either to enhance their existing products or create new developments in the next year . Industries which will see more R&amp;D attention are medical and aerospace , while it will remain low in semiconductor and electronic manufacturing . <p> Looking at roles -- those that will be in high demand this year will be mainly manufacturing engineers and process development engineers within the R&amp;D departments . These roles require talent to have relevant experience in similar background and specialised skills , as they are usually the ones driving innovation in the company . <p> Similar to the fintech industry , the manufacturing &amp; supply chain also faces a lack of skilled talent , with a widening skills gap . To address this , companies in Singapore are increasingly looking to technology and advanced manufacturing , and to prepare themselves for expansion when the market picks up . As such , companies should be creating new jobs in the digital economy , with a talent pool equipped with experience in these disciplines . <p> With that , as part of Industry 4.0 , roles related to next-generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine learning and artificial intelligence will be created -- likely improving the quality of the labour pool . <p> Salary expectations of job candidates in manufacturing &amp; supply chain <p> An organisation 's financial remuneration package has been highlighted as a key factor in a candidate 's job consideration , and this includes the base salary , incentives , allowances , and employee benefits . In 2020 , employees who are switching companies can expect an average salary increase of between 5% to 10% . <h> Most in-demand skills and job roles in FMCG &amp; retail <p> According to the report , firms in the fast-moving consumer goods ( FMCG ) service are actively trying to build an internal talent pipeline that consists of professionals who are skilled in both new digital media and traditional marketing . <p> In fact , as consumers ' behaviours and purchasing patterns constantly evolve , sales and marketing professionals need to be able to accurately anticipate upcoming market trends and build sales strategies and workflows around them . As a result , many employers are increasingly particular about who they hire . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process to be slightly longer in 2020 , as employers may want candidates to meet with more people from the company before they make a decision . Companies also tend to hire professionals for the role that the employers want to groom them into . For example , when a company opens a job position for a brand manager today , they are actually looking for someone who they can promote to become a brand marketing director in the next few years . <p> Additionally , candidates who demonstrate learning potential and professional maturity , as well as strong leadership qualities such as people management and effective communication skills , will be highly sought-after . <p> Employees ' salary and job-switch expectations <p> As compared to other sectors , the tendency of employees to change employers in 2020 is not as high in the FMCG space , with many holding back on changing jobs . Instead , there will be a higher focus on job security until the market recovers . <p> On the job search front , candidates will more likely apply to employers that are seen to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When changing employers , candidates can expect an average 15% salary increase in 2020."

This depends on the receptiveness of destination countries , many of which are currently restricting immigration , criminalizing asylum seekers and using emergent technologies to tighten borders . Should these trends persist , migration to higher-income countries will decline , trapping people in deteriorating situations and reducing adaptive capacity in low-income countries . The United Nations Global Compact for Safe , Orderly and Regular Migration provides an alternative pathway for international migration that builds capacity and sustainability for a climate-disrupted future . The implications of current trends for migrants , policymakers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The number of people seeking to migrate for reasons directly and indirectly related to climate is expected to rise in coming decades due to climate hazards already known to stimulate both voluntary migration and involuntary displacements , and rapid population growth in areas highly exposed to migration-inducing climate hazards1,2 . The specific nature of future climate-related migration flows will depend upon the adaptive capacity of people living in highly exposed regions and on the intervening variable of migration and border policies of potential destination countries3,4 . These links between climate change , migration and adaptation are addressed explicitly in the 2018 United Nations ( UN ) Global Compact for Safe , Orderly and Regular Migration5 , a non-binding international agreement that seeks to improve outcomes for migrants and displaced people . The Compact emphasizes the need to reduce involuntary climate-related migration and displacement , increase the adaptive capacity and resilience of vulnerable populations through greater international cooperation , and develop strategies for managing climate-related migration in ways that respect human rights and address humanitarian needs . If fully implemented , the Compact would help ensure that future climate-related migration occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is beneficial to migrants , to their families , and to sending and receiving communities . It would be particularly helpful in building adaptive capacity in low-income countries that are highly exposed to climate risks , and in creating regularized channels for international migration in situations where internal migration is not a viable or desirable option . <p> Unfortunately , the good intentions expressed in the Compact are not being matched in practice . Few nations show any interest in giving legal recognition to people who move for climate-related reasons , or in providing greater opportunities for international mobility for any reason -- climate-related or otherwise . Wealthy nations that were until recently important destinations for international migrants ( Australia , the United States and European countries in particular ) are implementing policies that restrict entry , discourage asylum claimants from approaching their borders , criminalize undocumented migration and pressure other countries to act similarly . Surveillance and detection technologies developed for military and anti-terrorism purposes are increasingly being used to enforce restrictive border policies and prevent the unauthorized approach of civilians . As legal pathways for international movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed into expensive and physically dangerous attempts to reach their destinations , often requiring the assistance of criminal networks . In such circumstances , future migrants will have little choice but to seek to actively evade authorities in destination countries , and to misrepresent themselves as political refugees . This places the well-being of migrants and their families in jeopardy , and is not beneficial to the sending or receiving communities . <p> Should such trends persist and strengthen , there is little prospect of meeting the goals of the Compact or , for that matter , the Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) or the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) . There is still the opportunity , however , to avoid such outcomes . The Compact , SDGs and UNFCCC collectively provide all of the policy-making tools necessary for responding successfully to the risks posed by climate change ; the challenge now is to implement them fully and rapidly . <p> The remainder of this Perspective details the implications of border and migration policy trends for future climate-related migration specifically , and for climate adaptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and future flows of climate-related migration and linkages with adaptation ; next , I describe current trends in border enforcement and the securitization of international migration ; finally , I describe the implications for migrants , for future socio-economic pathways and for research on climate-related migration . I conclude with a call to the climate change research community to increase its engagement with the general public and to use its influence to press policymakers for greater , faster uptake of the Compact . <h> Climate migrants within larger global migration flows <p> The current global stock of migrants consists of approximately 760 million internal migrants ( based on figures from 2005 ) and 258 million international migrants6,7 . These estimates are conservative , and may not , for example , accurately account for return flows of migrants from destinations back to their places of origin ( not all migration is indefinite in nature8 ) . An estimated 67.5 million of these migrants are involuntarily displaced for reasons primarily related to conflict and natural hazards , because of political violence or persecution , or seek asylum in other countries for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change quickly , international migration flows tend to change more slowly10 . International migration varies by region , especially migration originating in low- and middle-income countries . For example , most international migration by Africans is between countries within Africa ; international migration from Latin America tends to flow towards destinations in North America ( especially the United States ) ; and most international migration out of South and Southeast Asia flows to destinations in North America and the Middle East10 . Migration out of higher-income countries , by contrast , is more heterogeneous , flowing in a variety of directions . <p> Of these current migrant stocks and flows , it is difficult to estimate the number that move for reasons directly or indirectly attributable to climate events , due to uneven availability of statistical data on migration motivations , lack of a standard definition of what constitutes climate-related migration and the inherent multi-causality of migration11 . Climatic events and conditions typically interact with cultural , economic , political , social and other non-climatic processes to influence migration decision-making , and the climatic stimulus may be so tightly interwoven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolate4,12,13 . Even in the case of extreme , sudden onset events where the climatic phenomenon is an obvious driver , the resulting migration and displacements vary considerably by socio-economic group , creating multiple patterns of temporary and permanent migration into and out of the affected area , described by some authors as a migration ' churn ' 14 . In other words , any measure of current climate-related migration , or forecast for the future , will inevitably lack precision and contain numerous caveats . <p> Statistics from the International Displacement Monitoring Centre ( IDMC ) on the number of people directly displaced by climate-related hazards provide a rough indication of the relative influence of specific climate hazards on global migrant stocks ( but underestimate the absolute numbers because involuntary displacement is only one form of climate-related migration ) . In 2018 , approximately 16 million people , primarily in Asia , sub-Saharan Africa and the United States , were displaced by floods ( 5.4 million people ) , extreme storms ( 9.3 million people ) , droughts ( 764,000 people ) and wildfires ( 424,000 people ) 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next , but the 2018 figures are generally reflective of average patterns of the past decade . <p> Climate change will influence future flows migration flows in three ways . First , the severity and frequency of climate hazards will increase in many regions3,16 . For example , flood frequency and magnitude will grow in East Africa , South and Southeast Asia , parts of South America and at high latitudes in Asia and North America , affecting up to 70% of the global human population depending on the climate scenarios used17,18,19,20 . Climate models project an increased intensity of extreme tropical storms ( especially in Pacific waters off east Asia ) , with mean sea-level rise ( MSLR ) exacerbating storm surge risks in most coastal regions21,22,23 . The frequency of drought is expected to increase in many regions , particularly in west and southern Africa and the Mediterranean region , and affect up to two-thirds of the global population19,24,25 . <p> Second , population numbers are increasing rapidly in areas highly exposed to these hazards . The global population is projected to plateau somewhere between 9 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this increase occurring in less-developed countries26 . Populations in dry-land and water-scarce regions are growing particularly quickly , especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia27,28 , as are populations in low-elevation coastal zones exposed to coastal hazards , storm surges , and other risks associated with rising sea levels29 . The combined effects of MSLR and high rates of in-migration make deltaic areas of Asia and Africa likely hotspots for future climate-related migration30,31 . Although small in absolute population numbers , many low-lying Pacific island states have birth rates higher than the global average32 , and their overall population growth rates are moderated only by correspondingly high rates of out-migration33 . Coastal populations are growing swiftly not only in less-developed regions ; in south Florida , for example , the number of people exposed to MSLR of 0.9 m would increase from 385,000 to more than 1 million before the end of this century , should current rates of population growth persist34 . In summary , future decades will see more people living in locations that are increasingly exposed to the types of climatic hazards that regularly stimulate large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A third factor influencing future climate-related migration flows is the future adaptive capacity of people living in areas exposed to increasing or intensifying climatic risks35,36,37 . Populations with strong adaptive capacity at the household and institutional levels are better able to cope with and adjust to climate hazards with minimal amounts of displacement and migration16,38 . Consequently , climate-related migration is less common in industrialized , urbanized countries than it is in low-income countries with large rural populations . Where migrants are able to access labour markets at the destination and remit money home , migration can be a successful form of adaptation39 . Recent research from rural China suggests that not only are individuals and households that practise short-term labour migration more resilient to climatic hazards , but even those households that could migrate and choose not to do so are generally more resilient than households that lack the option40 . Mobility is an important component of household adaptability and well-being , even if it is not exercised . Take migration options away from people and their adaptive capacity may decline . It is worth noting that the link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context of climate ; migration has long been identified as a strategy to reduce household exposure to short-term economic risks and take advantage of emergent opportunities41 . <p> The vulnerability of a given population to climate hazards and the specific range of available adaptation options are shaped by cultural , economic , political and social processes operating at local to global scales4,42,43 . As a result , different types of climate hazards generate diverse migration outcomes in different places , and a single climate event may generate a variety of migration responses within the affected population44,45 . <p> For example , tropical cyclones -- a rapid-onset hazard -- cause tremendous damage each year to homes , livelihood assets and infrastructure , and displace large numbers of people ( 7.9 million people worldwide in 2018 ) 15 . In the year following Hurricane Mitch , which destroyed tens of thousands of homes in Central America in 1998 , labour migration increased from Guatemala , Honduras and Nicaragua to neighbouring countries and the United States46,47,48 . Similarly , the year after Hurricane Maria , 130,000 people left Puerto Rico for the mainland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coastal Louisiana after hurricanes Katrina and Rita , mobility being a key means of finding housing , employment and social stability50 . <p> By contrast , droughts and prolonged high heat events -- hazards that leave housing undamaged but undermine household incomes and food security , especially in rural populations -- typically do not generate immediate , large-scale displacement or migration . The slower , more cumulative impacts of the hazard allow further opportunities for adaptation through other means , such as water conservation measures , adjusting household food consumption , utilizing household savings , accessing insurance or government assistance ( where available ) and so forth51,52 . When heat and/or drought conditions persist and in situ ( that is , non-migration ) adaptation measures falter , rural out-migration may grow , especially internal , labour-seeking migration to established destinations44,53,54,55 . International migration outcomes in the wake of droughts are multidirectional , with out-migration from low-income countries tending to decline temporarily , while out-migration from middle-income countries temporarily increases56 . <h> Future international migration flows in a changing climate <p> The ratio of future internal versus international flows is difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of larger migration networks -- aggregations of socially and economically interconnected individuals , households and communities , present in both sending and receiving areas , and engaging both those who move and their relatives who do not57 . Once established , a migration network affects the propensity to migrate and migration destination selection by providing information to would-be migrants , shaping attitudes and norms about migration , and creating a common pool of resources for members to draw on58 . These networks are continuously evolving as individuals and groups within the networks proactively and reactively adjust to changing conditions . As new risks arise , the morphology of migration networks changes in terms of the destinations , duration of movement , participation rates and demographic characteristics of migrants59 . In this sense , there are three potential outcomes of climate change : <p> ( 1 ) <p> Larger flows of people along established migration routes , because the destinations become safer or more attractive , sending areas become less safe or less viable , and migration network effects continue to facilitate movement . <p> ( 2 ) <p> Unchanged or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either because the destination become less attractive or less viable relative to the sending area , or because migrant networks are not able to facilitate greater levels of migration . <p> ( 3 ) <p> New flows of migrants between sending and destination areas that have not historically been connected , leading to the creation of new migration networks . <p> These outcomes are not mutually exclusive , and any combination might occur in any given region . The first type is most likely to occur in regions with high rates of population growth , high levels of exposure to climatic hazards and well-established migration networks . The World Bank 's 2018 Groundswell report on future climate migration focused on such examples , offering projections of between 30 and 143 million additional internal migrants by mid-century in Africa , Asia and Latin America , depending on the climate and development scenarios used2 . The second type emerges as a result of a climate-driven reversal in the attractiveness of a destination , or a change in migration network effects . For example , Florida , which is currently a main destination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less desirable due to MSLR , leading to a reduction in migration flows and wider-scale changes in internal migration patterns60 . Migration flows might also decline due to changes in non-climatic factors such as labour markets , socio-economic changes in sending and receiving areas , border controls , visa regimes and immigration regulations . For example , well-documented connections between drought and migration from Mexico to the United States may weaken in the long term due to urbanization and economic changes in Mexico53 . <p> The third type of outcome -- new flows of migration -- requires a deeper dive into the question of how migration flows are initiated more generally . The root causes are related to social , economic , environmental and political conditions ( or drivers ) that provide the contextual back-drop for migration decision-making and shape whether , where , when and how people migrate61 . Climate change has the potential to influence predisposing drivers that make people more likely to migrate by exacerbating food and water insecurity , or generating wealth differentials between and within countries ; to generate new precipitating drivers that force people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase the number of proximate drivers by elevating the frequency , extent or duration of climate hazards in given regions , or by stimulating biodiversity loss that erodes livelihoods . Political , social and economic factors that facilitate or constrain migration -- often described as mediating drivers -- include those that act independently of climate change , as well as regulations and policies made in contemplation of climate-related migration ( such as those envisaged under the Compact ) . Mediating drivers are thus a key variable in determining whether climate change stimulates new flows of future migration , and whether migration along existing routes increases , declines or remains steady . It is in this respect that current trends in border enforcement and anti-immigration policies clash directly with the potential for building greater global adaptive capacity through safe and managed migration . <h> International recognition of climate-related migration <p> A key mediating factor for international migration is the receptiveness of governments in potential destination countries . At present , there is no formal legal protection or recognition for people who migrate for climate-related reasons . The process of creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept climate change as a valid reason for migrants to seek entry , although few express any willingness to do so . New Zealand has in recent years rejected several asylum claims from residents of Tuvalu and Kiribati requesting refugee protection on the grounds that their island homes have been damaged by climate change62 . After one such case reached the New Zealand Appeal Court in 2015 , the government proposed the creation of a special humanitarian visa programme for climate-displaced Pacific islanders , but the idea has since been quietly dropped63 . One reason is that the governments of Pacific Island nations are averse to the idea of being labelled as refugee source areas , preferring that developed nations instead make better efforts to mitigate GHG emissions , and allow for greater labour migration from Pacific Islands to expand economic development and remittance-earning opportunities64 . The government of Kiribati has for many years called for a ' migration with dignity ' programme that would allow its young people to train and work abroad , and remit money to help build adaptation at home ; should the time come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have already acquired the skills , financial resources and social capital to relocate successfully65 . Despite the great logic in such a proposal , there has been no uptake by potential destination countries . <p> Other options for creating legal protections that might result in a multilateral agreement addressing climate migration are progressing along two paths . One is through the UNFCCC process and the Paris Agreement , which focus on how to potentially prevent involuntary displacements from climate hazards , but do not address international mobility more broadly . The other path is the Compact , through which countries agree to cooperate in addressing factors that compel people to leave their country of origin , including natural hazards , climate change and environmental degradation . Among the Compact 's numerous objectives , a notable one is to "" enhance the availability and flexibility of pathways for regular migration "" ( Objective 5 ) 5 . Given the positive links between migration options , adaptive capacity and household resilience , this provision of the Compact could lay the groundwork for global , regional , or bilateral arrangements that facilitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a viable or desirable option . <p> The Compact is a recent instrument ( its final text was settled in 2018 ) and a non-binding one . Signatory states endorse its principles but are not legally required to implement them , unlike , for example , the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees , which is legally binding , but does not apply to people fleeing the impacts of climate change . Despite the Compact creating no legal obligations , the United States , Australia and a number of European states that are important destination or transit countries for migrants have explicitly stated they will not ratify it , out of concerns that it would erode national sovereignty and prevent them from implementing strict immigration regulations and border controls66 . <p> In the absence of widespread adoption of the provisions proposed by the Compact , any person who seeks to move internationally for climate-related reasons has only a few options : <p> ( 1 ) <p> Move to a neighbouring country that allows unrestricted entry ( if this is permitted ; many states do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal international migration programme that facilitates entry to high-income countries , such as a skilled worker visa programme . <p> ( 3 ) <p> Travel clandestinely to another country and hope the authorities do not notice or take no enforcement action if caught . <p> ( 4 ) <p> Travel to another country and misrepresent oneself to authorities as a political refugee . <h> The hardening of borders <p> Rising anti-immigrant sentiments in many countries67,68 and prevailing trends in migration and border enforcement suggest that international migration will become more restricted in the future . Undocumented migration is increasingly described by governments and popular media as being illegal or criminal , even in the case of people legitimately seeking protection under the UN Refugee Convention69 . Various theories exist to explain the origins of anti-immigrant sentiments , such as those that suggest that immigrants are often perceived as adversely affecting the labour market in destination countries , as being criminals , or as increasing in number too rapidly68,70,71,72 . Others argue that anti-immigrant sentiments are not necessarily becoming more widely held , but are intensifying within particular groups73,74 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear : governments of many traditional destination countries are placing greater restrictions on immigration and strengthening border enforcement75 . Considerable media attention is given to US President Trump 's pursuit of a more strongly fortified southern border and a policy of immigration ' deterrence ' 76 that features post-apprehension detention of unauthorized migrants and their children . But there are many other examples elsewhere . The Australian government has for years had a mandatory detention policy for unauthorized migrants , with those who attempt to arrive by boat transported to offshore , prison-like detention centres to await their asylum claim hearings77 . A few short years after allowing the entry of over a million asylum-seeking migrants , EU countries have fenced off the southern border of the contiguous Schengen region , are refusing migrant rescue boats permission to dock at Mediterranean ports , are paying transit countries to intercept and repatriate Europe-bound migrants , and are helping Sahelian nations to enhance control of their own borders78 . <p> It is not only wealthy countries that are tightening their borders . Venezuela 's neighbours have implemented stricter border controls in response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is deporting tens of thousands of Haitian migrants and Dominican-born people of Haitian origin80 , Kenya is constructing a border fence with Somalia81 , Mexico has reinforced patrols along its southern border82 , and 2019 elections in South Africa and India featured extensive discussions about taking stronger action against unauthorized migrants83,84 . <p> Recent technological advancements are making immigration and border enforcement more effective . Barricades , fences and checkpoints are being supplemented by ' virtual border ' technologies -- unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) , unattended motion detection sensors , radar , lidar , infrared cameras , facial recognition software and biometric tracers -- that feed into integrated data management systems that link records kept by police , border patrols , customs officials , airports , visa and immigration offices , and intelligence agencies85 . In the United States , officials speak openly of ' layering ' multiple technologies to reduce unauthorized crossings of the country 's southern border86 . The process began in the late 1990s , when US border patrol agencies started flying military grade Predator and Reaper UAVs , and installing in-ground motion detection sensors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now experimenting with smaller , more versatile drones that fly at low elevations and are cheaper and easier to operate89 . Drones and motion detection sensors are being supplemented by towers bearing radar , lidar and infrared cameras that can identify and verify the source of any movement , many using facial recognition software87,88 . <p> The EU has implemented biometric visas for third-country nationals and records their entries and exits electronically90 , deliberately channels asylum seekers and other unauthorized arrivals to a small number of ' hotspots ' 91 and in 2016 created an agency called Frontex to coordinate members ' border patrol activities and facilitate information sharing . Frontex participants use a range of technologies , including fixed , mobile and UAV-mounted infrared cameras and other sensors92 . The use of UAVs expanded after the 2015 migrant ' crisis ' , with an emphasis on deploying military drones to patrol large areas of the Mediterranean coastline , allowing for the early detection of unauthorized migrant-ferrying boats93 . Australia , China , India and Pakistan have also begun experimenting with UAVs for border surveillance94,95 , and as the technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to follow suit . <p> An important consequence of turning these technologies with military origins against civilians is that it securitizes the act of migration . It blurs the distinction between surveillance actions to detect and deter the approach of armed enemy agents -- something that every state has a sovereign right to do -- and monitoring borders to prevent the approach of unarmed civilians seeking entry : something every person has a right to do under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Refugee Convention . In this collision , the rights of the individual are lost . <p> Technology also makes for the easier detection and surveillance of migrants who make it past the border . Governments increasingly track migrants through the locational services of cellular phones and social media applications96 , with several European countries instituting laws that authorize officials to seize phones from migrants and asylum seekers , and search their metadata97 . The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement branch of the Department of Homeland Security maintains an electronic surveillance system that collects electronic data on target individuals or target devices when criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding its data collection methods , but an Immigration and Customs Enforcement search warrant application obtained by the Detroit News in 2017 shows that one method is through the use of Stingray cellphone tower simulators -- laptop-sized devices that trick cellphones in their vicinity into revealing their International Mobile Subscriber Number and Electronic Serial Number99 . The United Kingdom electronically tags asylum seekers , an action ordinarily reserved for people awaiting criminal trial and for convicted criminals who are released on parole100 . Next will be applications and systems that use artificial intelligence in the real-time and retrospective analysis of data to locate , track and apprehend migrants . <p> Unsurprisingly , the fear of electronic surveillance causes migrants to change their behaviour . For example , migrants in transit to the United States avoid calling friends or relatives from cellular phones , and constantly erase call records on their phones , in case the devices are seized by the authorities101 . Recent immigrants to New York City regularly turn off locational features on their phones and the social media sites they use , while Syrian asylum claimants in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their movements102,103 . Even with such precautions , migrants remain particularly vulnerable to electronic surveillance . Governments collect , store and share biometric data about third-party nationals that they would , for legal or political reasons , have difficulty gathering on their own citizens90,104 . Surveillance activities , enforcement actions , detentions and expedited administrative procedures used against migrants by the US , Australian and European governments are often inconsistent with domestic and international legal and humanitarian obligations , and with basic legal principles of habeas corpus and **26;977;TOOLONG . Also worrisome are reports that humanitarian organizations are often pressured to share data about their beneficiaries with donor states and operational partners , creating another channel for the collection of personal data about refugees , displaced people and migrants in poorer countries108 . <h> International climate migration is dangerous and costly <p> Vigorous , technologically sophisticated border enforcement makes unauthorized migration less successful , more expensive and more dangerous , and pushes migrants to seek assistance from criminal organizations . The US -- Mexico border provides one example . In the 1990s , millions of undocumented workers moved back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most crossings took place near San Diego and El Paso ; the consequences of being caught were modest ( for example , few were placed in detention , most were simply returned to Mexico ) and many who were caught often tried crossing again110 . Border enforcement has become much stricter . Since 2006 , interdiction rates have increased by 50% , the number of successful unauthorized entry attempts dropped from 1.6 million annually to less than 200,000 and the fees charged by migrant smugglers in Mexico have quadrupled111 . The location of clandestine border crossings has shifted to the margins of the Sonoran Desert , where there ar"

Microsoft has announced another event for the end of this month in China and it 's believed this is where the Surface product line will be discussed -- perhaps with a new Surface Pro housing faster Intel processors and better battery life on the agenda . <p> At Build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this front ."
"<h> Brian Howey : Taking measure of Vlad The Strongman <p> NASHVILLE , Ind . ( WTHR ) - In the autumn of 2015 , Indiana Republican National Committeeman John Hammond III was the first to broach the idea that Americans were open to electing a "" strongman "" as president , the observation coming as Donald Trump was rising in the polls . Voters were yearning for an American version of Vladimir Putin . <p> Why ? America is becoming browner , older , while the workforce with a huge emphasis of "" shareholder profits "" is moving toward an era that will not sustain the middle class as we know it . A 2013 Oxford University study shows that some 47 percent of American jobs could be lost due to artificial intelligence and automation . Say goodbye to the branch bank and the grocery checkout clerk . A 2016 study from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that 9 percent of jobs would be completely displaced in the next two decades . <p> These are seeds for political unrest on a scale far , far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump into the White House on Nov. 8 . One of Trump 's first excursions outside of Trump Tower came at the Carrier plant in Indianapolis , where he and Gov . Mike Pence triumphantly "" saved "" 800 jobs , heralding a coming $16 million company investment . But in a CNBC interview , United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes acknowledged , "" We 're going to ... automate to drive the cost down so that we can continue to be competitive . We will make that plant competitive just because we 'll make the capital investments there . But what that ultimately means is there will be fewer jobs . "" <p> We 've learned over the past few weeks is that the other "" strongman "" on the global stage , Russian President Putin , personally directed encroachments into the U.S. presidential election . That is the assessment of the CIA , FBI and 15 other U.S. intelligence agencies . It came after Trump during his last press conference on July 27 said , "" Russia , if you 're listening , I hope you 're able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , do I think Russia impacted the election , swinging it for Trump ? No . Frightened and alarmed American middle class voters elected Trump . <p> What is alarming is that not only has Trump carried on a bromance with President Putin , he flat out rejected the U.S. intelligence assessments . "" These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction , "" Trump tweeted . "" They have no idea . "" Actually , the intel agencies have a "" high degree of confidence . "" <p> For years , Trump has lauded Putin . In 2007 , he said , "" Look at Putin . He 's doing a great job in rebuilding the image of Russia and also rebuilding Russia period . "" Last December , Trump told MSNBC 's Morning Joe , "" He 's running his country and at least he 's a leader , unlike what we have in this country . "" Reminded that Putin and his government is complicit in the murders of dozens of journalists and political rivals , Trump responded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "" <p> This past week , an Economist/YouGov Poll showed that 37 percent of Republican voters have a "" favorable "" opinion of Putin , up from 24 percent in September . <p> Is Putin a strong leader ? Annexing the Crimea , propagating civil war in the Ukraine and propping up a genocidal regime in Syria are classic ways to take measure of a strongman . <p> Celebrity Net Worth puts Putin 's wealth at $70 billion , while the CIA put it at $40 billion in 2014 . <p> Former Russian oil executive Mikhail Khodorkovsky , an original post-Soviet oligarch until Putin wrested control of his Yukos oil company and imprisoned him , observed , "" At first , he thought he could build sort of a democratic model that he could control . A model like this does not exist , so he started to slide towards at first mild totalitarianism , and then an increasingly harsh totalitarianism . If the situation develops further , he will reach a full totalitarian model . In reality , every authoritarian system is a kleptocracy . "" <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertility rate has plummeted to 1.7 births per woman . The Moscow girls that made us sing and shout are not leaving the West behind . The Russian male life expectancy is 64 years , compared to 76 in the U.S. and 75 in Indiana . <p> The Russian economy has contracted by 3.7 percent since 2014 , according to The Diplomat , while the value of the ruble has fallen 127 percent . <p> Credit Suisse puts the median Russian income at $871 annually , compared to $1,000 in India , $52,000 in Indiana and $56,000 in the U.S. Frontline reports that 110 individuals , many Putin cronies , own 35 percent of the wealth , the most unequal nation on the planet . YaleGlobal 's estimated number of Russians living below the subsistence poverty line was 20 million last year , up from 2 million in 2014 . <p> According to IHS Jane 's Defense Budgets Annual Report , military spending in Russia rose by 21 percent in 2015 . <p> Edward Lucas , a senior editor at The Economist , notes , "" Putin was trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp eye for human weakness . He 's good at persuading people and intimidating them , and he 's been doing this with Western leaders , sometimes with charm , sometimes with threats . But boy , does he do it .

"<h> mic Listen to the podcast : <p> During the past decade , the distribution of content over the Internet and its consumption on computers and mobile devices has disrupted several industries -- newspapers , book publishing , music and films , among others . Now education joins that list , thanks to the emergence of massive open online courses , or MOOCs . These courses , which are offered for free to tens of thousands of students , cover topics ranging from artificial intelligence and computer science to music and poetry appreciation . As millions of students around the world flock to participate in MOOCs , universities are being compelled to rethink what it means to teach and to learn in a networked , globally connected world . During the past 18 months , many educational institutions have initiated or joined ventures that can help them explore , experiment in and gradually understand this phenomenon . <p> Among the most active MOOC providers today is Coursera , a start-up that offers some 200 online courses to 1.5 million students . It does so by providing a technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania . Other MOOC initiatives include Udacity , which originated at Stanford , and edX , a venture of Harvard and MIT . How do MOOCs deal with the challenge of scale posed by the massive numbers of students they attract ? How do they retain and evaluate their students ? How can they monetize their free content ? Knowledge@Wharton posed these questions and more to Daphne Koller , co-founder of Coursera , during her recent campus visit . <p> An edited version of the conversation appears below . <p> Knowledge@Wharton : How does a massive open online course ( MOOC ) , like the ones taught through Coursera , differ from the traditional educational experience ? What are the pros and cons ? <p> Daphne Koller : The experience differs from the traditional face-to-face educational experience , but it varies based on which audience you 're talking about . MOOCs have been offered to the general public , but they are also a way of transforming the educational experience of on-campus students . <p> Students in the general public have a tremendous opportunity to be exposed to knowledge that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sliver of the world 's population . These students do n't get the same experience necessarily as the on-campus students , because they do n't get that one-on-one connection with the instructor . But on the other hand , the availability of this content is a tremendously enabling experience for those students . It is still a hugely interactive experience in terms of working with the material , which is not just video . There are a lot of exercises and assessments . Furthermore , an educational community is created based on students interacting with each other . <p> At the same time , students on campus can benefit from that same content and have the experience of going and watching the content outside the classroom and then coming into class and having more time for active learning and an interactive experience with their instructor . <p> Knowledge@Wharton : How does Coursera fit into the higher education landscape ? Does a MOOC supplement traditional learning as you just described it , or do you see it as a substitute as well ? <p> Koller : I think it depends on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be enrolled in an academic institution such as Wharton , Princeton or Stanford , there is a tremendous opportunity to supplement standard instruction and repurpose classroom time for a much more meaningful and interactive experience . <p> However , many students will never have access to this quality of education . So you can view this as a substitute for the education that they would have wanted . Many students taking our courses are , in fact , already educated professionals . They have a degree or sometimes have an advanced degree . They want to expand their minds and learn new things . They will never go back to school in a formal setting , whether for financial or geographical constraints , but this provides a tremendous learning opportunity . <p> Knowledge@Wharton : I understand 33 institutions offer MOOCs through Coursera . How many students have they served ? <p> Koller : That 's right . We currently have more than 1.5 million students enrolled on our platform . And there are five million distinct course enrollments because students often enroll for more than one class . However , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of our nearly 200 classes have not yet started to run . I think we 've served hundreds of thousands of students so far , but not the full 1.5 million that have been enrolled . <p> Knowledge@Wharton : What have you learned so far about the participation , completion and dropout rates of this online population ? <p> Koller : This is what we see : Enrolling is easy . It 's a matter of just clicking a button , and it 's free . A lot of students do that . Then when it comes time for the course to actually begin , about 70% of students show up , possibly because those who do not attend have found their life has moved on , and they 're now busy doing something else . <p> Of the ones who show up , we see a bifurcation of the population . There are students who come in and they are primarily there to watch the videos . Of those who start watching videos , about 30% to 40% watch the course to its completion , with a fairly constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then there is the second population : These are students who really do intend to take the course for real . We gauge that by seeing who submits the first assignment . If you submit the first assignment , you probably intend to take the class for real . The retention rate for this population is comparable : About 30% who start the first assignment will complete the last one . <p> In terms of what you might traditionally call "" retention "" -- that would be the number of students who submit the final assignment relative to the population who initially enrolled for the course . In those terms , we have a retention rate of 7% to 9% , depending on the course . But that 's really the wrong way of looking at it because many of these students never really intended to seriously take the class in the first place . <h> Sponsored Content : <p> Knowledge@Wharton : I understand that the gamification course that was offered through Wharton had 70,000 people who initially enrolled , and about 9,000 completed it . That 's quite a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of courses where you have seen greater success than others ? <p> Koller : We do n't have a sufficiently large sample size right now to gauge what makes for a successful class and what does n't . In fact , we 're currently researching what factors increase retention and what factors increase engagement . <p> We 're now running a test where students are sent encouraging e-mails once a week saying , "" You did so well on the last couple of assignments , and the next one is due tomorrow . Do n't you think it would be good if you log in and try to complete the next one ? You do n't want to break your winning streak . "" We are trying to test whether that actually increases student engagement . <p> One of the really beautiful things about having such a large population of participants is that you can run these experiments and get statistically significant results that will help you improve the learning experience for students . <p> Knowledge@Wharton : Some of the institutions that offer these courses offer credit , and some do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Currently only one institution , the University of Washington , offers credit . They 're offering credit for an enhanced version of a course where students have interaction with the instructor and some additional homework besides what 's available on Coursera . <p> I think that granting credit is a very sensitive issue for institutions ; they need to think carefully about what makes a credit-bearing class and what does n't . The transformational change we 're seeing right now is so new . It was only a year ago when the first real MOOCs launched . The educational community is still trying to assimilate the change and figure out where to take this . I believe that over time more institutions will move into the credit arena , but it 's still early days . <p> Knowledge@Wharton : Do any institutions offer certification ? <p> Koller : Most of the institutions we 're working with have agreed to offer some kind of unofficial certification . But most of our current population are people who already have a degree , so the question of whether the course carries credit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they can present to an employer to demonstrate competence in a particular topic . I 'm very pleased that most institutions have decided to offer that benefit to students , which allows them to gain something substantial for their work . <p> Knowledge@Wharton : Is it Coursera that offers the certification or the institution ? And is there any charge for it ? <p> Koller : So far we 've been able to offer a statement of accomplishment or something comparable : It 's an unofficial letter from the instructor with the instructor 's signature that does not carry university authorization . For some courses in the coming months , we plan to offer university-branded certificates explaining that the certificate was awarded for an online , non-credit bearing course . This will be different from what the university offers its own enrolled students , and will also carry the Coursera brand . When we begin to offer those certificates we believe there will be a small charge because this has substantial value for students . <p> Knowledge@Wharton : When you have certification , the question of assessment becomes very critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would imagine that would be a challenge . How have you dealt with that ? <p> Koller : We have devoted extensive attention to assessment and feedback . We believe that exercises where students receive meaningful feedback are a critical part of the learning experience . If you do n't get feedback , you may not complete the work or learn the material properly . <p> We 've developed an extensive set of exercises that can be graded automatically by the computer . There 's the fairly mundane multiple choice , fill-in-the-blank or numerical answers . There are also in-depth assessments to grade -- for example , programming assignments and Excel spreadsheets with financial models . <p> We 've also recently introduced peer grading to roughly a dozen classes , where students critically assess one another 's work and provide both a quantitative grade as well as qualitative feedback . By combining ideas from the peer review process that 's used in academia , with the crowd sourcing ideas that are used on websites like Wikipedia , we believe we can provide students with meaningful feedback for the open-ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in business . <p> Knowledge@Wharton : I understand that peer-reviewed assessments help to address the scale question . But is n't the absence of feedback from a qualified instructor a limitation ? <p> Koller : In certain disciplines and contexts , it is a limitation . For example , I would not use peer review to grade 10,000-word essays where an instructor would be able to provide an in-depth assessment and give substantial , expert feedback . This is not going to be an experience that is comparable to the experience that a student attending the University of Pennsylvania will receive . There will be differences . <p> The question we should ask ourselves is n't whether we 're going to achieve equality between students at the University of Pennsylvania and students in the general public . Instead we should ask if , through the use of technology , we have improved the quality of the experience for each of these students separately . We want all students to be better off than they were before . <p> Knowledge@Wharton : You said that a lot of the people who take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there may be some young people who are trying to become professionals . How do you address issues related to verifying a student 's identity or plagiarism ? How have you dealt with these issues ? <p> Koller : As the mix of courses that we 're offering changes to include more introductory classes , we 're seeing an increase in the population of 18- to 25-year-olds , and often even younger students from high schools . I think that 's a really exciting direction because it is an important segment of the population to which you want to offer high quality education . <p> There is a range of technological solutions that one can adopt to address issues of plagiarism , cheating and identity verification . But keep in mind that you will never be able to stop cheating entirely , even in the most controlled environments . It 's always going to be an arms race . If you prevent some forms of cheating , others will emerge to replace them . You have to set realistic expectations . <p> Meanwhile , I believe discussions about cheating on online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheating that takes place . For example , in the online Princeton sociology class , the teaching assistants graded every single one of the 2,500 midterms . They estimated the proportion of plagiarism was around 5% . Even if that 's a low estimate and the actual rate is closer to 10% , is that really so much higher than what we see in on-campus classes ? Not clear to me . <p> Knowledge@Wharton : I have some questions about the business model . Coursera is not the only MOOC initiative . I wonder how you compare your approach to that of edX or Udacity . <p> Koller : Let 's start with the Udacity comparison : We are a technology platform that enables the best institutions to offer their education to the rest of the world . We 're not intending to become an educational institution in our own right . We do not produce our own content . We rely on some of the world 's best instructors to provide content and set academic standards . We distribute amazing content by having relationships with some of the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edX initiative , in some respects , is more similar to what we 're doing because it 's also an institutional-level effort . It 's a small consortium of some of the world 's outstanding institutions . I think that it 's wonderful for students around the world to have access to content from those universities as well . This arrangement between institutions provides economies of scale , since a single platform is an expensive and complicated thing to develop . We also believe it 's beneficial to have a single place where people can find a very large amount of content . We have almost 200 courses right now and more coming up on this hub . That 's why we have 1.5 million students , and the population is growing . <p> Finally , I think an advantage that may not be apparent from the outside is having collaboration across institutions , which allows institutions to learn a tremendous amount from one another . Online learning is a completely new paradigm in teaching . This is not your standard class being videotaped and placed online ; this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of learning together . Having peer institutions that are all communicating with each other helps to develop sound pedagogy and good ways of exploiting this new paradigm and this new medium so much faster . <p> Knowledge@Wharton : Since Knowledge@Wharton has been giving away free content and free knowledge for the past 14 years , this is a question that is very dear to my heart . There is clearly a cost to producing the content . How do you plan to monetize your service ? <p> Koller : Yes . There is not only a cost to produce the content , there is also a cost to host and disseminate the content . There is also a cost to develop the platform . We can not simply count on some miraculous influx of funds from philanthropic foundations to keep us going indefinitely . We have to make this venture sustainable . <p> We have several ideas on revenue models , all of which remain to be tested because we 're still in our early days . But one strategy , discussed earlier , is the potential to charge for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content free for everyone , if you get a certificate at the end that allows you to go and apply for a job and gives you some kind of tangible benefit , then it 's reasonable to charge for that . <p> We also believe employers will put in money to be granted access to the records of students who have taken some of our courses . Employers would receive much more quantitative and detailed information about these students than just their resume , which is what they say about themselves . This way , employers can learn if the students did well , both in hard skills , like on the exercises , and in soft skills , like helping others in the discussion forum and in study groups . That 's really important information in a 21st century workplace , and I believe employers would be willing to pay for this . We have already had some interest from employers about this . <p> Knowledge@Wharton : Will the institutions that are part of Coursera also monetize their content in some way ? <p> Koller : When we bring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share the revenue with the institutions , specifically to support content production . <p> Knowledge@Wharton : What 's next for Coursera over the next five to 10 years ? <p> Koller : I think that in five years we will be able to offer most curricula in most disciplines . Eight months after starting , we 're now able to offer 200 courses . A typical institution has something like 3,000 courses . I think in five years we will have 3,000 courses , so that if you want to be educated as a mechanical engineer or as a businessperson or as a lawyer , you will be able to access some of the world 's best courses for your field . <p> I also think that in five to 10 years , from the perspective of the higher education ecosystem , people will look back on the 20th century and say , "" I ca n't believe that we spent so much of our students ' time shoveling them into auditoria and having them sit there for 75 minutes while somebody lectured at them . "" We will all clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to learn material and use it effectively . I think our notion of what makes for a good education will shift drastically . <h> For Educational/Business use : <h> Additional Reading <h> Innovation <p> Former Westfield CMO Beth Ann Kaminkow discussed different facets of digital transformation and the changing role of the CMO with Knowledge@Wharton , during the recent "" Fast Forward : Executive Strategies for Personal Digital Transformation "" conference , sponsored by Mphasis."

"<---- to happen in the talent management space in 2017 ? Sylvia Vorhauser-Smith , global head of research at PageUp , provides her predictions <p> The redefinition of work will continue to evolve <p> 2017 will see the redefinition of work become more pronounced . The rise of the millennial generation is spurring a shift towards flexible work arrangements , whilst retiring baby boomers and Mums returning to work increasingly opt for freelancing and contingent ( part-time ) work opportunities . The gig economy , in which temporary positions are common and organisations contract with independent workers for short-term engagements , crowdsourcing , and the rise of the on-demand economy -- synonymous with Uber and Airbnb - are also increasingly changing the landscape of business . <p> The redefinition of work has huge implications for the way organisations recruit as no longer can they afford to have a linear relationship with a candidate . Rather , recruiters will need to increasingly maintain internal and external networks of talent , tipping traditional sourcing strategies on their head . <p> These new models of working also promote workforce agility in that they allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either from outside , or inside the business , or both . This also creates challenges for human resources ( HR ) when it comes to recruitment , performance and compliance . It 's going to be more important than ever for HR to have their finger on the pulse when it comes to looking both internally and externally for talent with the right skills and appetite for various projects . Organisations that have clear visibility into their total talent network will be able to mobilise the right people , for the right roles , with the right skills , at the right time . <p> An acceleration in personalising the employee experience <p> 2017 will also see the acceleration of personalised talent management practices driven by a focus on employee experience and made possible by technology , thus resulting in a shift away from standardised best practices . HR departments will increasingly adopt consumer marketing tactics , such as segmentation in an effort to drive engagement and enrich the employee experience as employees essentially become the ' new customer ' . <p> The success of this within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technologies which can help support and scale it across their workforce . ' Smart ' learning opportunities tailored for individuals which are employee-centred and goal-oriented are already a reality for some organisations . Machine learning , using algorithms in talent management are already helping to tailor learning content and help HR customise the employee experience . Similarly , an effective talent mobility strategy will also be important for keeping employees engaged and providing visibility of internal job opportunities and projects aligned to their interests and skills . <p> An explosion of real-time , continuous feedback <p> Creating a culture of continuous feedback will be top priority for organisations and is being driven by millennials ' expectations for regular , ongoing feedback and the increasingly fast-paced business environment . Adopting tools that enable people to receive regular feedback from different sources , such as peers , customers or multiple managers for instance , will therefore become more and more important for boosting engagement among the growing millennial workforce and improving overall productivity . In doing so , organisations can develop a stronger workforce which positively impacts their overall company goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have reached a new level of maturity making it possible for managers to easily capture and provide ongoing feedback to their teams , at any time . Tools are becoming smarter and embedding activity streams , pulse surveys and other techniques for feedback . The rise of Performance Management Apps , which continued to surface in 2016 , are helping to make regular feedback a formalised process that can be provided and captured from any mobile device . This type of technology will continue to see rapid adoption in 2017 as more and more organisations look to reinvent or complement the traditional annual performance review with ongoing , everyday feedback . <p> The rise of people analytics and digital HR taking data to new heights <p> The maturity of people analytics will empower HR to play a greater role in influencing executive-level decision-making , with the ability to provide richer insights on people productivity metrics than has previously been possible . The sophistication of people analytics refers to reporting beyond typical HR data such as recruitment and retention metrics , to providing the business with a holistic view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent data . <p> Like most HR innovations today , technology is driving this shift and leading the sector further down the path of data-driven decision-making with the ability to correlate people data to business performance , and in some cases predict business performance , as well as plan future workforce needs . Over the coming year , what will matter most is how quickly and easily HR can access a multitude of people data and explore it alongside other types of data to improve business outcomes . <p> Along the same vein is the rise of digital HR . A plethora of new HR technology is transforming the industry as we know it today and forcing organisations to undergo a degree of digital transformation . The emergence of machine learning and artificial intelligence which mimics human decision-making processes whereby algorithms can learn from and make predictions based on patterns of behaviour , will foster smarter recruiting and talent management practices . Whether helping HR tailor the employee experience or analysing the traits of star performers in order to guide future recruiting decisions , the rise of digital HR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry increasingly data-driven . <p> A focus on wellbeing as a driver of performance &amp; engagement <p> With factors such as new models of work , a fast-paced society , the need for continuous feedback all challenging the way we do things , organisations are having to work harder than ever before to keep people engaged , and are realising the importance of promoting healthy , happy employees . <p> Wellness with respect to driving performance and productivity will become a major focus in 2017 . Formalising wellness to improve productivity outcomes is fast-becoming a corporate responsibility which is fuelled by the expectations of a growing millennial workforce , and their appetite for flexibility . <p> A focus on wellbeing means implementing true flexible work arrangements such as compulsory flexible working that 's not frowned upon , more emphasis on ensuring people are fit to work and even putting a cap on leave accrual so that people take regular breaks . It may also be about organising wellness workshops or setting wellness goals/KPIs and ensuring they are just as important as professional goals/KPIs . Fitbit technology is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team challenges can be set and encouraged by managers . <p> In order to be productive employees need to feel that their wellbeing is in the organisations ' best interests , presenting HR with a very ripe opportunity to step up their efforts in this area in 2017 . <p> What 's certain is that digital technology underpins all of these trends - driving some , supporting others and creating irreversible momentum for transformational change in HR."
"<p> Humans have relegated insects to the lower levels of the cognitive totem pole , but scientists are increasingly showing it 's a mistake to underestimate invertebrate intelligence . As a case in point , new research by French and Australian researchers suggests honey bees understand the concept of zero -- a rare and complex capacity shared by an exclusive group of animals . <p> "" Zero is a difficult concept to understand and a mathematical skill that does n't come easily -- it takes children a few years to learn , "" Adrian Dyer , a co-author of the new study and a researcher at RMIT University in Melbourne , Australia , said in a statement . "" We 've long believed only humans had the intelligence to get the concept , but recent research has shown monkeys and birds have the brains for it as well . What we have n't known -- until now -- is whether insects can also understand zero . "" <p> Dyer , with the help of his colleagues at the University of Toulouse in France , recently concluded a series of experiments suggesting the answer is yes , at least among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of zero , or nothing , means these animals are smarter and more adaptable than we realized , and that big , bulbous brains are n't necessarily required to comprehend some seemingly complex or abstract ideas . The new study , published today in Science , should also serve as inspiration to researchers involved in AI and robotics ; there are simple and efficient ways to get small brains to perform powerful tricks . <p> A honey bee during the experiment.Photo : RMIT University <p> Bee brains have fewer than a million neurons , compared to the 86 billion neurons packed inside the human skull . But studies have shown that honey bees are capable of some extraordinary cognitive feats , such as understanding "" same "" and "" different , "" learning intricate skills from other bees , and the capacity to count ( a trait known as numerosity ) and to discriminate up to four objects . For the new study , Dyer and his team wanted to know if honey bees understand the concepts of "" greater than "" and "" less than , "" and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way down to zero . <p> Advertisement <p> For the experiment , the researchers lured honey bees to white sheets pasted on a wall , each of which contained between one and six dark shapes . Using a food reward in the form of a sugar solution , the bees were trained on "" greater than "" and "" less than "" tasks . So for a "" less than "" task , a bee was rewarded if it went to the sheet containing three black dots instead of the sheet with five black dots , for example . <p> Following this training , the bees were confronted with a completely new type of display : a completely blank sheet . Incredibly , bees trained on the "" less than "" task consistently went to the blank sheet instead of sheets containing one or more black shapes . They seemed to intuitively know that "" nothing , "" or zero , is less than one , despite never being exposed to an empty set before . <p> Now , that may not sound impressive , but it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far seen in only a handful of nonhuman animals , namely primates ( including rhesus and vervet monkeys ) and the African grey parrot . Zero is something that even confounded early human civilizations , with some early numbering systems lacking the concept . <p> Advertisement <p> A honey bee approaching a blank sheet of paper , suggesting it knows "" nothing , "" or zero , is less than the other values presented . Photo : RMIT University <p> This discovery now presents a fascinating problem for neuroscientists . <p> "" It is relatively easy for neurons to respond to stimuli such as light or the presence of an object but how do we , or even an insect , understand what nothing is ? "" asked Dyer . "" How does a brain represent nothing ? Could bees and other animals that collect lots of food items , have evolved special neural mechanisms to enable the perception of zero ? If bees can learn such a seemingly advanced maths skill that we do n't even find in some ancient human cultures , perhaps this opens the door to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concept of nothing . "" <p> Advertisement <p> Lars Chittka , professor in sensory and behavioural ecology at Queen Mary University of London , said the new study is another important contribution to the question of whether animals need big brains to solve tasks that have traditionally been thought of as complicated . <p> "" Clearly , the answer is no , "" Chittka told Gizmodo . "" This begs the question of what neural circuitry a miniature brain like the bee 's might use to mediate such remarkable performances -- this is obviously of interest to us biologists as well as the artificial intelligence crowd . "" <p> Chittka , who was n't involved in the new study , said he could n't think of an obvious natural setting in which it 's important for bees to understand the number zero , but nonetheless , they appear to get it . That said , the finding is consistent with his own research on adaptive tool use in bees , showing that bees can flexibly cope with challenges they 've never encountered before in their evolutionary history . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bees -- and possibly many other animals -- do not have the kind of ' cognitive toolkit ' that is often inferred , that is , where they have one cognitive ability to cope with challenge A , another cognitive ability to cope with challenge B , and so on , "" he said . "" But instead it appears that they have a more general-problem solving ability ( ' intelligence ' ) that allows them to cope with tasks they 're unlikely to encounter in nature . In human children , mathematical ability is often used as an indicator of general intelligence and logical problem solving skills -- and the same may be the case in bees : the ability displayed in these experiments might be an indicator of a more multipurpose insect intelligence . "" <p> But not everyone is convinced by these findings . Clint Perry , a research fellow and a colleague of Chittka 's at QMUL , says bees may very well be capable of understanding the concept of zero , but he does n't see the evidence for that in the current work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the results . <p> "" I applaud the authors for taking on the task of investigating such a difficult question in comparative cognition , "" Perry told Gizmodo . "" However , there are a number of control experiments that are missing for me to interpret their findings as evidence for bees understanding the concept of zero or even using any level of numerosity to solve the task . I feel a much more parsimonious explanation for the results is that bees chose stimuli based on a combination of simpler visual cues , such as the amount of black in each stimulus or the area or edge length of each stimulus , which I do not feel was properly controlled for , and how often the bees were rewarded on each category of stimulus during training . "" <p> Advertisement <p> Perry , an expert in the cognitive capacities of animals with very small brains , says it 's interesting that bees might be able to understand the concepts of "" greater than "" and "" less than , "" but he believes a critical control was missing from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "" I feel the question of whether bees understand the concept of zero , and even the absence of information , is still wide open and ripe for investigation , for which bees and other social insects are excellent subjects , "" said Perry .

"" <p> For Chittka , the next step for researchers should be an investigation into the strategies used by bees in counting , and assessing number rules . For example , bees might look at number of dots in a display simultaneously , like humans do when looking at dots on dice , or they might use a kind of sequential "" ticking-off "" strategy in which they inspect items one after another , and then infer rules of "" greater than "" and "" less than .

Expect months of caucuses and primaries , as the large field of Democratic candidates is whittled down to one . <p> "" In the race for the White House , President Donald Trump can lose up to 36 electoral college votes and still win . But his low approval ratings make this race a toss-up , "" says Politico. <h> 2020 Olympics Games <p> Tokyo will host the world 's largest sporting event next year , from 24 July to 9 August , with more than 200 nations and 11,000 athletes competing in 33 sports . The Olympic Games is followed by the Paralympics from 25 August to 6 September . <p> In a forecast released a year ahead of the Games , data service Gracenote Sports predicted that the US would win the most medals ( 126 overall ) , followed by China ( 81 ) and then host nation Japan ( 67 ) , reports The Guardian . Great Britain is predicted to come fifth , with 43 medals in total . <h> Brexit <p> The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 January 2020 . The two Article 50 extensions in March and October 2019 left the British public somewhat sceptical about "" firm "" departure dates . <p> But that was before Boris Johnson stormed to victory with a 80-strong majority in the general election in December , on the back of a campaign to "" Get Brexit Done "" . This enabled the government to comfortably pass the second reading of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill , which is on course to become law in January -- but that will not be the end of Brexit . The Leave date will mark the beginning of another set of detailed negotiations on how to reconstruct the UK 's entire relationship with the EU . <h> Tech world <p> While the fifth generation of mobile internet connectivity is already available , 2020 is likely to be the year when "" 5G really starts to fly "" , according to Forbes .

"<h> Roger Partridge : New Zealand 's great education decline and the future of work <p> The rise of automation , artificial intelligence and pressures from developing economies are threatening low-skilled and unskilled jobs . Never has the need for school leavers to be well-educated been more important than today . <p> Yet somethingis rotten at the core of New Zealand 's education system . A growing proportion of children leave school unable to read an instruction manual or do basic maths . Over the past 20 years , our education system has slipped from being the envy of the world to barely mediocre . <p> Kiwi students once ranked near the top of international education league tables . In the latest results from the highly rated Progress in International Reading and Literacy Study , Year 5 students placed last among all English-speaking countries and 24th out of all 26 participating OECD countries . Students suffered similar slides in maths and science . <h> Read More <p> The New Zealand education system is also now one of the most unequal in the world . The gap between the educational "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English-speaking OECD peers . All this , despite Government spending per child increasing in real terms by more than 30 per cent since 2001 . <p> In her new book , my New Zealand Initiative colleague Briar Lipson exposes how pseudo-scientific dogmas have enveloped our education system . The book reveals New Zealand 's education delusion : How bad ideas ruined a once world-leading school system is a startling dissection of the perils of the so-called child-centred approach forced on to schools by official curriculum and assessment policy . <p> The child-centred approach places children at the centre of decisions about both what they learn and how they learn it . Subject matter should "" relate to the child "" and teachers are encouraged to let children lead their learning . <p> Gone are the days when teachers followed a national , knowledge-based curriculum , ensuring all children are exposed to the same knowledge in core academic subjects like English , maths , science and social studies . Instead , the much-vaunted New Zealand Curriculum is a scant 67 pages long . The entire curriculum for social science ( including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) for Years 1-13 fits on a single A4 page . <h> Advertisement <p> How much children learn about the world around them is left to the discretion of the individual school , teacher and , increasingly , child . Instead of knowledge , children are to develop "" competencies "" like problem-solving and critical thinking , commonly described as "" 21st century skills "" . ( Goodness knows how any leader managed when they were educated in the 20th century . ) <p> Some schools have continued with a more traditional , knowledge-rich curriculum . This is especially true of schools that have opted out of the National Certificate of Educational Achievement ( NCEA ) in favour of international examination systems like Cambridge or International Baccalaureate . But in state schools , the New Zealand Curriculum 's extreme child-centred approach prevails . <h> Related articles <p> The problems with a child-centred approach are obvious . Or they are to almost everyone except those responsible for the education system . If the content of classroom study must "" relate to the child "" , students may learn little about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be greatest for children whose home life involves neither books nor quality time engaging with adult family members . <p> But the purpose of education must be to open every child 's eyes to the world . To take them beyond what is familiar . To give them a chance to foot it with the best in the world . Without broadening children 's knowledge of the world -- and of New Zealand 's place in it -- schooling limits their ability to think critically about the world . <p> Children will not grasp a headline about the perils of "" Shipping arms to the Saudis "" if they do not have a wide enough vocabulary to comprehend that arms does not mean body parts and that Saudi Arabia is a nation involved in conflict in the Middle East . <p> Never has the need for school leavers to be well-educated been more important than today . Photo / Getty Images <p> Closer to home , some readers may recall the scandal in 2018 when Year 13 History students complained that they could not be expected to understand the meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NCEA exam . Some guessed the word meant significant . Others had no clue . Within a few days , 2500 students had signed an online petition asking the New Zealand Qualifications Authority to mark the exam leniently . <p> In response , NZQA said the exam language was "" within the range of vocabulary "" for students at NCEA Level 3 . However , if students had addressed the quote and integrated their ideas with it , NZQA agreed they would not be penalised for misinterpreting the word . <p> This prompted shocked disbelief . How could trivial be beyond the comprehension of students in their 13th year of education ? The disbelief was not just local . News of the fiasco appeared in the print media in both Australia and the United Kingdom . <h> Advertisement <p> In New Zealand 's Education Delusion , Lipson argues that the solution to these education woes is to strengthen the role of knowledge in the New Zealand Curriculum . <p> Drawing on both empirical research and cognitive science , Lipson shows that the New Zealand Curriculum 's approach has things backwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading comprehension to creativity and problem-solving ( try fixing an engine without knowing how it works ) . Lipson 's research also demonstrates that direct instruction by teachers is the best route to gain that knowledge . <p> Taking on the education establishment is not for the faint-hearted . The Ministry of Education , the New Zealand Council for Education Research and the teachers ' unions are well-organised . They ( mostly ) sing from the same song sheet and defend their beliefs with a religious fervour . And were it not for international data , it would be almost impossible even to identify New Zealand 's downward trajectory and grave inequities . <p> True to form , Lipson 's report has been greeted with howls of outrage from proponents of the child-centred approach , including former Kiwi ( and now Australian ) educationalist Professor John Hattie , and Principals ' Federation President Perry Rush . Indeed , Rush was in such a hurry to get out his press release in response to Lipson 's report he had clearly not had time to read Lipson 's report . <p> Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for The New Zealand Initiative to focus on something useful like "" the inequities of our education system "" ( instead of his precious child-centred learning ideology ) was precisely what the Initiative 's report has done . <p> Making the transmission of knowledge the centre of education is an issue of social justice . Many children from vulnerable communities start school with an enormous knowledge gap compared with children from homes full of books . One US study reveals that a child living in poverty can start school having heard 30 million fewer words than her classmates . <p> If schools do not try to solve the knowledge gap with a knowledge rich curriculum , New Zealand 's grave educational inequities will continue . <p> Fortunately , Lipson 's is not a lone voice . Other academic educationalists like Victoria University 's Dr Michael Johnson and the University of Auckland 's Professor Elizabeth Rata are engaged in the battle against the extremes of child-centred dogma . So too are many teachers and principals -- especially at independent schools whose boards have adopted a traditional educational approach . <p> Success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the education system 's child-centred delusion is setting up for failure those who need the most help ."

This shows that big data-based technologies and analytics will only be increasing , and that is why AutoML will be one of the prime focus of organisations in 2020 to process the vast data . <h> Bridging The Skills Gap <p> AutoML holds the great promise of helping the non-tech companies or companies with less data science expertise with the capabilities of building their ML applications . With the launch of Cloud AutoML , based on Neural Architecture Search ( NAS ) and transfer learning , Google believes that it has the potential to make the existing AI/ML experts more productive along with helping the less skilled engineered to build a powerful AI system . <p> Technologies like AutoML have given organisations today the capability to quickly build production-ready models without the help of expensive data science . AutoML uses ML , AI and deep learning to provide businesses , across the world , the opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the existing talent gap in the data science industry . <p> AutoML , along with bridging the talent gap , is also at the same time democratised machine learning . This has helped to carry out processes like hyperparameter tuning , selection of algorithms , and finding the appropriate model -- as these tasks are tedious and at the same time complex . Because of AutoML machine learning can now be adapted in various sectors easily by data scientists without any complexity . <h> Improving Scalability <p> Generally , when we see machine learning applications like image colourisation , automatic translation , we know that such tasks require massive amounts of data . With this enormous amount of data , training a model takes a long time , and sometimes the model is big and can not be fitted into a working memory of the training device , and therefore becomes a difficult task . Plus , the evaluation , experimentation , and deployment of the models might have different use cases . AutoML , on the other hand , makes it easy to handle data , train model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for different use cases as it takes on the task to find the best algorithm for the task to be done . <h> Conclusion <p> Globally the demand for data scientists was projected to exceed supply by more than 50% in 2019 . A lot of companies believe that hiring talented data scientists is a tough job because they are scarce and expensive . AutoML is a solution for companies to find a way to bridge the talent gap that exists in the data science industry . Not only does it benefit the less skilled data scientists , but also save time for the highly skilled once , so that they can oversee other high priority projects instead of wasting time on the tasks which can be automated by AutoML . <h> Provide your comments below <p> comments <h> Enjoyed this story ?

Today , we are Canada 's largest healthcare IT provider . <p> Over the last decade , Telus Health has played a key role in transforming healthcare in Canada by building the digital backbone necessary for a more seamless flow of information between physicians , pharmacists and other healthcare professionals ; as well as insurers and large enterprises providing health benefits to and processing claims for employees . That type of collaboration enables all key players to take a more holistic and data-driven approach to wellness , improving overall health outcomes while empowering Canadians to actively participate in their care . <p> As well , our technologies leverage the security of the Telus network so patient data is kept on home soil . We understand the concerns Canadians have about the privacy and management of health information which is why we have strong privacy policies as well as private and rigorous data governance processes to ensure patient data remains safe , secure and confidential . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in some cases exceed , the highest industry-recognized standards . Personal data is never shared with any other organization without a patient 's consent , and are held with technical and organizational security in compliance with the maintenance of Canadian health records . <p> An important example of how our innovative technologies support the healthcare system is the Telus Health Exchange ( THX ) platform . This national , standards-based , open electronic communication platform is designed to support collaboration and facilitate better communication within the healthcare system . It smooths out the rough edges and ties the often disparate , siloed endpoints of our system together , bringing more efficiency to healthcare professionals while delivering effective care to patients . "" <p> Brian : As a developer of health IT solutions yourself , why is it important to support the acceleration of innovation in healthcare and how does the Telus Health Exchange ( THX ) platform enable that ? <p> Charles : "" Innovation and great discovery do n't happen in a vacuum . We recognized early on that in order to keep moving the needle on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of supporting better health outcomes , we needed to find a way to connect the many niche but innovative technology players . <p> Beyond supporting our own technologies , the THX connects Telus Health to innovative third-party systems and to one another to create a complete , complementary and open network that delivers a vast array of new digital tools for the healthcare community . With the THX platform , we have paved the way for the creation of a truly interconnected healthcare and innovation ecosystem . <p> With its open architecture and the Telus Health application interface programming ( API ) , the THX platform is allowing the brightest minds with the most forward-thinking solutions to tap into a larger network of healthcare professionals , improving access to information and exposing their technology to real-world use while managing the security and privacy that is critical to health information . Partners can create new applications that integrate into Telus Health solutions using shared components , helping to easily onboard new external vendors and suppliers while bringing innovative solutions to those on the front lines . <p> The COVID-19 pandemic has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in healthcare . It showed us just how quickly silos can hurt people , with the scale and pace of the pandemic outrunning our ability to share information across provincial borders . We heard from governing bodies and other partners in the healthcare space that they needed better and faster access to information to make data-driven decisions , like whether or not to implement physical distancing policies . If we work together , we can improve connectivity to accelerate much-needed information sharing during these difficult times . "" <p> Brian : What are some examples of how the THX platform enhances the workflow and information sharing among healthcare professionals and payers to ultimately improve the delivery of patient care ? <p> Charles : "" Our healthcare professionals , as well as insurance providers , use various solutions to complete their daily tasks -- from a physicians ' electronic medical record ( EMR ) to a pharmacist 's management system and even health benefits management solutions . In an ideal , efficient and well-connected world , all of these should be able to speak to each other to facilitate the accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are able to bring these services together in a unified way , enabling them to securely communicate with each other and creating a well-connected ecosystem that benefits all members of the care continuum , but most importantly , the patients . It brings speed and agility to an industry that still relies on outdated technology , like fax machines . <p> For example , the THX allows a personal health record ( PHR ) platform to be integrated with other services , such as an EMR that physicians use to manage patient information . When a physician updates a patient 's EMR , those changes are reflected simultaneously in a PHR that the patient can access . <p> Similarly , the THX also enables more efficient communication between physicians and pharmacists through e-prescription services like PrescribeIT . A physician can create a patient prescription using their EMR , and electronically send it to the patient 's pharmacy of choice , received through the pharmacy management system ( PMS ) . The integration offered by a service like PrescribeIT also enables pharmacists to electronically request prescription renewals and allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any time . <p> It even allows the use of eClaims services , delivery of referrals , secure messaging between healthcare professionals and patients , and integrated virtual care services that enable remote consultations . <p> With a holistic and accessible approach to care management , the THX provides an integrated platform that empowers both healthcare professionals and patients to fully engage in the care journey , helping to ensure the best possible health outcomes . "" <p> Brian : As we continue to strive for improved interoperability and collaboration within the healthcare system , what role do you think Telus Health will play in continuing that trajectory ? <p> Charles : "" Telus Health is uniquely positioned to accelerate collaboration within the healthcare system not just through the connectivity offered by the THX , but more importantly because of our deep ongoing commitment to the patient experience across the health system as well as Telus ' globally-recognized privacy and security by design approach . <p> We offer pan-Canadian solutions to virtually every facet of the healthcare continuum , from primary care EMRs to pharmacy management systems , claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

"<h> Can robots ever have a true sense of self ? Scientists are making progress <p> Having a sense of self lies at the heart of what it means to be human . Without it , we could n't navigate , interact , empathise or ultimately survive in an ever-changing , complex world of others . We need a sense of self when we are taking action , but also when we are anticipating the consequences of potential actions , by ourselves or others . <p> Given that we want to incorporate robots into our social world , it 's no wonder that creating a sense of self in artificial intelligence ( AI ) is one of the ultimate goals for researchers in the field . If these machines are to be our carers or companions , they must inevitably have an ability to put themselves in our shoes . While scientists are still a long way from creating robots with a human-like sense of self , they are getting closer . <p> Researchers behind a new study , published in Science Robotics , have developed a robotic arm with knowledge of its physical form -- a basic sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There is no perfect scientific explanation of what exactly constitutes the human sense of self . Emerging studies from neuroscience shows that cortical networks in the motor and parietal areas of the brain are activated in many contexts where we are not physically moving . For example , hearing words such as "" pick or kick "" activate the motor areas of the brain . So does observing someone else acting . <p> The hypothesis emerging from this is that we understand others as if we ourselves were acting -- a phenomenon scientists refer to as "" embodied simulation "" . In other words , we reuse our own ability to act with our bodily resources in order to attribute meanings to the actions or goals of others . The engine that drives this simulation process is a mental model of the body or the self . And that is exactly what researchers are trying to reproduce in machines . <h> The physical self <p> The team behind the new study used a deep learning network to create a self model in a robotic arm through data from random @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information about its geometrical shape or underlying physics , it learned gradually as it was moving and bumping into things -- similar to a baby learning about itself by observing its hands . <p> It could then use this self model containing information about its shape , size and movement to make predictions related to future states of actions , such as picking something up with a tool . When the scientists made physical changes to the robot arm , contradictions between the robot 's predictions and reality triggered the learning loop to start over , enabling the robot to adapt its self model to its new body shape . <p> We look the same , but we know we 're different.Phonlamai Photo/Shutterstock <p> While the present study used a single arm , similar models are also being developed for humanoid robots through the process of self exploration ( dubbed sensory motor babbling ) -- inspired by studies in developmental psychology . <h> The complete self <p> Even so , a robotic sense of self does not come close of the human one . Like an onion , our self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify with the body , being located within the physical boundaries of that body and perceiving the world from the visuo-spatial perspective of that body . But it also involves processes that go beyond this , including integration of sensory information , continuity in time through memories , agency and ownership of one 's actions and privacy ( people ca n't read our thoughts ) . <p> While the quest to engineer a robotic sense of self that encompasses all these multiple layers is still in its infancy , building blocks such as the body schema demonstrated in the new study are being created . Machines can also be made to imitate others and predict intentions of others or adopt their perspective . Such developments , along with growing episodic memory , are also important steps towards building socially cognitive robotic companions . <p> Interestingly , this research can also help us learn more about the human sense of self . We know now that robots can adapt their physical self model when changes are made to their bodies . An alternative way to think about this is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects are coupled to the body ( sticks , forks , swords or smart phones ) . <p> Imaging studies show that neurons active during hand grasping in monkeys also become active when they grasp using pliers , as if the pliers were now the fingers . The tool becomes a part of the body and the physical sense of self has been altered . It is similar to how we consider the avatar on the screen as ourselves while playing video games . <p> An intriguing idea originally proposed by Japanese neuroscientist Atsushi Iriki is that the ability to literally incorporate external objects into one 's body and the ability to objectify other bodies as tools , are two sides of the same coin . Remarkably , this blurred distinction requires emergence of a virtual concept -- the self -- to act as place holder between the subject/actor and objects/tools . Tweaking the self by adding or removing tools can therefore help us probe how this self operates . <p> Robots learning to use tools as an extension to their bodies are fertile test beds to validate such emerging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , the research will lead to development of more intelligent , cognitive machines working for and with us in diverse domains . <p> Perhaps this is the most important aspect of the new research . It ultimately brings together psychology , neuroscience and engineering to understand one of the most fundamental questions in science : Who am I ? q! q! q! q! q! q!"

As part of the objective , the intelligent RPA solution managed to lower the cost per transaction by a whopping 91% . <p> Quality of information has improved drastically and is virtually error free . <p> The UiPath Robot accesses the email source , interprets the content contextually , classifies and files all the necessary documentation , extracts relevant data and updates necessary systems , interacts with the human users to complete specific instructions and finally delivers confirmation once the process is complete . <p> Thanks to the Robot 's ability to process data with more-than-human accuracy , the workflow error ratio is now drastically improved , guaranteeing full compliance . <p> "" The adoption of UiPath technology into the Hollard document flow has made substantial differences in the way data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robots with the ability to learn as people do - only faster in order to become invaluable assistants in the document processing flow . The data that is passed between systems is more accurate . The wait time for document processing has been reduced . There is great satisfaction in adopting the automation by staff because of the easy nature in which UiPath is used , "" said Uven Pillay , Head of Strategic Projects at Hollard . <p> Both the relationship with brokers and Hollard 's own employees have improved significantly . This was particularly owed to the staff 's positive attitude towards automation . They were the first to attest to the benefits : their work experience flourished as the pressure posed by the high volumes of processing have diminished considerably . <p> In The Economist 's latest issue focused on AI , it 's estimated that while 85% of companies think AI will offer a competitive advantage , only one in 20 is "" extensively "" employing it today .

"<h> India-Russia youth interaction will be important addition to bilateral ties Putin <p> PTI October 05 , 2018 23:01 IST <p> ( Eds : Adds MEA statement ) New Delhi , Oct 5 ( PTI ) Interaction between young people of India and Russia , especially schoolchildren , would perhaps be the "" most important addition "" to the "" unprecedented level "" of bilateral ties and serve as a basis for a long-term cooperation , Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday . Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Putin interacted with some young talents drawn from India 's Atal Innovation Mission ( AIM ) and Russia 's SIRIUS educational centre . Modi , in his remarks , urged the youths of both the countries to work on innovation to improve the way of living of the poor and the needy . An MoU was also signed between AIM and SIRIUS for furthering their cooperation through exchange of visits , sharing best practices in the promotion of educational , scientific and innovation and to foster a knowledge driven innovation ecosystem in India and Russia . "" With cooperation of your counterparts , I am sure the interaction between young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition , and perhaps the most important addition , to the unprecedented level of India and Russia relations that we see these days , "" Putin said . "" This is the basis for a long-term cooperation , "" he said . Modi also expressed his delight in meeting students of both the countries , and pitched for having sustained exchange programmes . "" This ( Russian students ' visit to India ) should be taken forward . Indian students should visit Russian institutions , and more and more such exchanges should take place . India and Russian students together must think what can they do to make lives simpler for people , especially the poorest , to improve their way of living , "" he said . The prime minister also asserted that every generation must have a "" scientific temper "" whether a person turns into a scientist or not .

Putin earlier had a one-on-one meeting with the prime minister on Friday after his arrival here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the visiting dignitary During the interaction , the two leaders also took a few questions from both Russian and Indian students , on subjects such as value of teachers , scientists and areas of research . Putin in his parting remarks , said , one student asked about the areas of research to work on , "" One area is artificial intelligence . But without human intelligence , at least at this stage , it is impossible to fathom that an AI would be created . In order to continue with that , those who deal with cognitive sciences understand that the main thing is to work as a part of a team . "" "" So , I am really grateful to the Prime Minister for inviting talented , young Russians to India , which is a practical step to show that you are ready to work as part of a team . So we wish you every success , "" the Russian president said . Brightest of minds from the two different countries were brought together by the spirit of innovation at the AIM-SIRIUS bootcamp here . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sochi has been started a year-round Educational Centre ' SIRIUS ' ( TALENT and SUCESS Foundation ) for children who showed endowments in the fields of arts , science and sports .

"" For the future of Russia , it is Putin 's biggest investment , entire intellectual capabilities , commitment and emotion , he has invested in this ( SIRIUS ) , "" Modi said . Putin to a question from a student on importance of teachers , said the prime minister invited me for dinner last night and one of subjects he discussed was education . "" So , it looks like education is something that receives a lot of attention in both India and Russia . We celebrate Teacher 's Day on October 5 and India marks it on September 5 ...

"<h> Centers of Excellence in Africa : Time to inculcate entrepreneurship for future jobs <h> There is no dearth of issue-specific centers of excellence ( CoEs ) in West , Central , and East Africa . However , what is lacking is - CoEs which could solve the challenges of the fourth industrial revolution with a transdisciplinary approach . These CoEs have made an edge in producing good employees but now the time has come they start shaping employers in the areas of future jobs . <p> In this age of technology-driven innovations , artificial intelligence is fast replacing humans . It 's not only the manual work , but the new trends in artificial intelligence are also fast replacing complex cognitive tasks and highly trained white-collar-jobs . Though coming in stages , this replacement is the fastest and largest ever in the history of industrialization . <p> According to a recent report of the University of Oxford , the automation industry may replace about 65 percent of jobs in Nigeria , 67 percent in South Africa and 85 percent in Ethiopia . The impact of machine learning and artificial intelligence is not limited to any particular domain or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a report titled the Future of Jobs and Skills in Africa 2017 had predicted that by 2030 ; about 41 percent of jobs of South Africa , 46 percent in Nigeria and 52 percent of Kenya are susceptible to automation . However , there is a silver lining to the Fourth Industrial Revolution -- it will generate new kinds of jobs . This has ignited research for future job opportunities and skills required to grab them . Here comes the challenge before academic institutions to revise their strategy to match the drastically changing technological innovations and quest for new areas of entrepreneurship . There have been some integrated and coordinated efforts to set up and operationalize a series of CoEs in Western , Central , Eastern and Southern African countries to match the challenges of the jobs market in this drastically changing scenario . <p> ACE project was launched by the World Bank in 2014 in collaboration with the participating countries . The first phase of the project - ACE I - was completed in 2019 while ACE II and ACE Impact are operational . <p> ACE I <p> Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were selected from nine Western and Central Africa countries . They received funding from the World Bank for augmenting and enhancing their research capabilities , specializations , training and to meet the demands for skills required for Africa 's development such as extractive industries . <p> These institutions were also endowed with a robust academia-industry relationship to ensure knowledge partnership with the private sector for industry-oriented curriculum and research and commercialization of institutional expertise through consultancies . The 22 CoEs were focussed on three thematic areas -- Agriculture ( Ghana , Nigeria , and Togo ) , Health ( Ghana , Nigeria , and Senegal ) , and STEM ( Benin , Burkina Faso , Cameroon , Ghana , Nigeria , Senegal , and Cote d'Ivoire ) . Though the STEM ( Science , Technology , Engineering , and Mathematics ) is a separate category in the STEM CoEs are not the islands . They were mandated to work in an integrated and holistic way to mentor young people for critical knowledge and skills so that they could develop problem-solving capabilities . Besides , they were also mandated to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for knowledge dissemination , technology transfer , curriculum sharing , and training , etc . The World Bank had allocated about $8million for each CoE . This amount was provided as a loan to the partner countries with the Association of African Universities ( AAU ) as the nodal agency . Concluded in 2019 , this was the first World Bank project aimed at the capacity building of higher education institutions in Africa . <p> ACE II <p> Based on the lessons learned from ACE I , the second phase ( ACE II ) is basically an extension of the project in Eastern and Southern Africa . In this phase , 24 existing institutions of international standards were identified for financial support and mentoring . They are working in the five regional priority areas -- industry , health , education , and applied statistics . Besides the objectives of ACE , I , these institutes also have a mandate to develop a culture of results-orientation and accountability through an exemplary performance-based financing mechanism . Presently , about 17 CoEs are operational . These CoEs are primarily transdisciplinary in nature with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their domain areas include -- Data Sciences , Internet of Things ( IoT ) , Energy for Sustainable Development , Public Health and Herbal Medicine , Water Management , Sustainable Agriculture , and Sustainability , etc . The host countries of ACE II CoEs are -- Kenya , Ethiopia , Mozambique , Rwanda , Tanzania , Uganda , Zambia , and Malawi . <p> ACE Impact <p> Launched in 2018 , ACE Impact is an improved version to support and mentor higher education institutions in Africa for capacity building and enhancing their training capabilities . Jointly funded by the World Bank and the French Development Agency ( AFD ) , the project includes 43 CoEs ( 18 from ACE I and 25 new institutions ) , five emerging centers , one ' top-up ' center in risk management and five colleges and schools of engineering . With a total budget of $250-$350 million , the CoEs is to be provided funding for about 4-5 years . These CoEs are being set up in Benin , Burkina Faso , Cameroon , Cote d'Ivoire , Ghana , Nigeria , Senegal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CoEs operating under ACE Impact have been mandated to fulfill the three primary objectives ; increase enrolment of students , enhance the quality of post-graduate programs and improve development impact such that the knowledge and skills acquired by graduates are closely linked to developmental challenges . Besides , they will be required to prioritize in three broad areas -- <p> focussing on their respective thematic sectors , <p> the scope within each of the pre-identified thematic sectors that apply to the Current skills gap within this area in West &amp; Central Africa ; and Applied research needs for industry . <p> National and international partnerships . <p> The structural and operational strategy of these CoEs were designed to suit the higher-order objective - to meet the labor market demands for skills within specific areas where there are skill shortages affecting development , economic growth and poverty reduction . <p> The Way Ahead <p> Besides providing training and mentoring for research students , the CoEs under ACE I have collectively forged 87 partnerships with aspiring institutions and industries thereby generating $8.9 million in revenue . These institutes have produced 1600 Ph.D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16,000 mid-career employees/ professionals . <p> However , a review of the ACE projects has raised some serious concerns which need to be bridged . These concerns could be addressed by adopting appropriate structural and operational strategies for targeted research in response to development challenges , enhancing sectoral engagement , increasing strategic/ functional regional and international partnerships , strengthened institutional-level impact , improving student support and welfare , increasing enrolment and better retention of women . Besides , CoEs need to develop a strategy to stop the brain drain and retain talented students in Africa and bridge the skill gap required for the industry . Besides , the CoEs should also develop a non-discriminatory , research-oriented and performance-based recruitment mechanism so that the talented PhDs join them as faculty . The World Bank has also expressed concerns on only 30 percent of faculty holding PhDs in CoEs . This problem could be addressed by facilitating the parallel entry of talented and research-oriented Ph.D . holders in the CoEs to increase the quality of the faculty . <p> Furthermore , the CoEs should also focus on inculcating entrepreneurship culture among their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job seekers ."

"<h> The troubled past of plastic and the future of plastic humans <p> Plastic has found reach in our scientific odyssey and along the way has patiently cultured a lot of depth in the human psyche as it strives to define how to shape the commercial needs of our everyday life . Photo : Pixabay <p> CAPE TOWN -- Plastic sits at the vulnerable crossroads of our common industrial past , the querulous present and an uncertain future . In respect of its past or in this case the history of its chequered footprint , notwithstanding its service to mankind , plastic has borne most of the brunt of condemnation for the state of the global environment . <p> While the article intends to focus on plastic 's present mission , its future is patently uncertain . Its future and that of the Earth-dwellers it serves , is so uncertain to the extent that D-Day for the rest of us may already be here . It may announce gradually or in stealth . All we need to do is to pay attention . <p> Plastic has found reach in our scientific odyssey and along the way has patiently cultured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strives to define how to shape the commercial needs of our everyday life . <p> The extent to which modern livelihood is defined by plastic can be measured by the dependency of the human condition to the versatility of plastic , making the fate of the two inextricably intertwined . <p> While man is in complete denial , plastic knows full well that there could be no plastic without modern man , and that in equal measure there could be no modern man or his vacuous civility without plastic . The demise of one , gradually or suddenly , is bound to abruptly curtail the life of the other . But that has been fairly predictable . In its devious schemes , plastic hatched a perfect plot . <p> After a long battle , we have reached a critical tipping point . Modern man and his civilisation is already on his way out , only to be replaced by a higher order of half-man and half-machine . In the age of artificial intelligence , the plastic civilisation of modern man shall regrettably be replaced by robots , made out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is known by its shorthand endearment , 4IR , tends to think of itself as a facilitator of progress . Never for once has it conceded to the possibility that everything in its envisioned future shall be made of plastic by plastic machines and may unwittingly forever alter the cognitive construct of the biblical man . <p> In Sweden , a rudimentary version of a bionic man has suddenly emerged , embedded with plastic chips under the skin , possibly for communication or for recognition by automated banking facilities and workplace computer logins . A few versions of upgrades later , we can confirm that the aliens are not green one-eyed extra-terrestrials flying from outer space . They never left . They have been here all along rehearsing on sleek plastic moves . <p> The solutions sought must in earnest commence from the honesty of the definition of the problem . Or in the parlance of the sages , from the intellectual dishonesty of modern man . <p> Garbage is not a plastic problem , whether at street corners , landfills or floating around the vast , vast ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admittedly a problem of private human behaviour refusing to own up to their public responsibility . <p> In an article quoted in Engineering News , Anton Hanekom was emphatic . "" We should declare war on pollution - not on plastic . "" <p> Across the evolutionary progression of human development since the days of the primordial soup , no relationship has ever found so much convergence of purpose , dangerous even . So dangerous is this chemical mix of man and plastic that its toxicity has metastasised to all areas of human endeavour . <p> The ultimate battle of survival shall be between man and his nemesis , plastic ! One must die . At this point , plastic is winning . <p> True to form , the front end of the popular endeavour is focused not at replacing plastic , but at finding different and more morally and sustainable sources . <p> To South Africa 's advantage , it is already in the forefront of producing bioplastics . South Africa knows we are at the most advanced stage of producing plasticised human machines . <p> Plastic robots assisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so keenly that Siri might be a perfect-looking lonely girl at an upmarket bar on Friday evening . <p> The material benefits of this hydrocarbon derivative are variegated , fairly dispersed and scientifically calculable , notwithstanding the controversy about its abuses by humans post its known or rehearsed utility . And in great irony , as we prepare to abandon the proprietary uses of fiat paper currency , we are in full mode in transition to plastic money . <p> Whether in transport , utilities of convenience , artefacts of warfare or in computer equipment including apparel , there is no gainsaying the reach of plastic as it forges regardless to accomplish its mission in the modern aeon . Yet , discarded plastic in its current construct stands the opportunity to provide us with diesel , petrol , jet fuel and other useful liquefied chemical complexes which would continue to be relevant for our mobile condition . <p> Advanced technologies renowned for conversion of plastic manufacture pellets that could be mixed with asphalt to construct far more durable tarmacs . And where it is not put to use for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sustained heat energy vortex . <p> It is an advantage requiring that no one has to dig the earth or scrounge for the resource that begets plastic . Daan du Toit , the deputy director-general of International Co-operation at the Department of Science and Innovation is also quoted in the same Engineering News as saying that the concept of a "" circular economy is one in which waste is seen as a valuable resource to be kept in the value chain in order to get the maximum utility out of the source material "" . <p> Do n't get me wrong . There is no intention to hold court for the sordid past of plastic , nor to exculpate the dereliction of care by its inventors and users alike . <p> It is the present relationship which is important , paying particular heed to the undeniable existentialist reality of plastic .

A challenge South Africa faces is that we typically only get quarterly public safety data from the South African Police Service and other organisations . <p> Advertisement <p> "" Researchers need more granular data than this . Social media presents an opportunity to identify when someone posts something about public safety and to use these available data points to build analytics tools to extract insight from this . "" <p> Marivate showed a Twitter post that described a smash-and-grab incident in Bree street ( Lilian Ngoyi street ) , in Johannesburg , which includes an indicator of the time it occurred -- half an hour before the tweet -- and the location , as well as the incident . <p> While social media is not effective in combating individual crimes , patterns can be identified that can lead to more effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems run in real-time , it can help users , such as the police , to identify short-term trends and potentially catch a criminal or a gang conducting a crime spree . <p> The analytics tools require natural language processing to identify information from the posts . <p> The team also taps into information often posted on social media by public safety organisations , such as Arrive Alive and emergency services . The public safety tools can also process short-hand notes posted on social media , which is often used by these organisations . <p> "" The Data Science for Public Safety initiative looked at the use case of social media data . Important for any public safety tool is the context of the incident , which can be filled in with social media information , where available . "" <p> Marivate noted that these tools would only be effective in areas with high social media use , typically urban areas , and are not as effective in rural areas . <p> The work over the past few years has aimed to identify whether the post is a description of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial intelligence to disambiguate the information available to provide useful information . <p> "" It is interesting to determine how we can use data science for science and government applications . At the start , we labelled posts ourselves and then used publicly available data to train the predictive models to improve performance . "" <p> Further , the work is compelling because it not only aims to classify when a post describes an incident and identify normal topics related to crime or public safety , such as traffic incidents , but to identify unique information and build a system that can automatically identify unique information , explained Marivate . <p> "" The work we have been doing over the past year has focused on differentiating between crime and public safety in social media posts , which can look very similar . Determining the context is difficult ; however , the models can effectively differentiate between the different categories . Mostly the posts are about a hijacking , and/or recovery of a hijacked vehicle , traffic lights that are out ( possibly posing a public safety risk ) or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What this has allowed us to do is to build the capability . We are working with law enforcement and we have access to data from the City of Tshwane . We contributed to the Tshwane Safety App , which has been out for two years , and helped build the analytics for them to better understand reports over the app and allow the reports to be used . "" <p> The CSIR is also working with the Tshwane Metro Police to do data resource planning to determine what has entered their call centre , read and analyse text messages and make the systems responsive to data that comes in and is fed back in from the analytics engines . <p> By : Reuters A strike by South African public sector workers planned to start on Monday was called off after most trade unions accepted a government pay offer that exceeds Treasury provisions for salary increases .

"<p> Let 's say you 're interested in buying a car , so you visit a new car dealership . Imagine your disappointment if you learned that the only information the salesperson can give you is the number of seats in each vehicle . <p> How crazy would that be ? Of course , to make sure a car fits your requirements , you need a lot more information . <p> What color is the car ? Does it have the right accessories ? And , what kind of gas mileage does it get ? Ultimately , you would also like to know how it performs under different conditions , like driving in town and on the highway . Only when armed with more information could you make an informed decision about buying a car or making a comparison between different vehicles . <p> Until now , that 's pretty much how we have evaluated quantum computers . The focus has mainly been on the number of qubits in a quantum computer while ignoring many other important factors affecting its computational ability . <p> Before Google announced it had achieved Quantum Supremacy , the media speculated on how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ignoring the controversial technical aspects of Google 's accomplishment , it finally achieved the benchmark . Of course , most articles focused on the fact that Google used a 54-qubit quantum processor . <p> What 's next after quantum supremacy ? <p> Beyond quantum supremacy , the next major benchmark , called quantum advantage , is on the distant horizon . Quantum advantage will exist when programmable NISQ quantum gate-based or circuit-based computers reach a degree of technical maturity that allows them to solve many , but not necessarily all , significant real-world problems that classical computers ca n't solve , or problems that classical machines require an exponential amount of time to solve . <p> World-changing applications will be possible once we reach quantum advantage . The major applications will likely include optimization , chemistry , machine learning , and organic simulations . <p> From Quantum Supremacy to Quantum Advantage <p> Although the number of qubits is essential , so are the number of operations completed before qubits lose their quantum states . Qubits decohere either due to noise or because of their inherent properties . For those reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex problems is not just a simple matter of increasing the number of qubits . <p> Before we can move from a hundred qubits to one with thousands of qubits , and eventual to one with millions of qubits , many significant technical issues remain to be solved . Moreover , none of the problems have overnight solutions . It will likely take another five or ten years of incremental research , experimentation , and steady technical improvements to find answers . <p> Configuration changes - subtle and significant -- can dramatically affect the performance of a quantum computer . Determining the optimum quantum computer configuration is much like solving a Rubik 's Cube . In the process of trying to align all the blue tiles on one surface , the previously solved red surface becomes disrupted . <p> The power of Quantum Volume <p> It would be helpful if quantum researchers had a tool that allowed them to systematically measure and understand how incremental technology , configuration and design changes affected a quantum computer 's overall power and performance . Corporate users also need a way to compare the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quantum volume factors <p> IBM <p> IBM foresaw the need for such a metric in 2017 when its researchers developed a full-system performance measurement called Quantum Volume . <p> Quantum Volume 's numerical value indicates the relative complexity of a problem that can be solved by the quantum computer . The number of qubits and the number of operations that can be performed are called the width and depth of a quantum circuit . The deeper the circuit , the more complex of an algorithm the computer can run . Circuit depth is influenced by such things as the number of qubits , how qubits are interconnected , gate and measurement errors , device cross talk , circuit compiler efficiency , and more . <p> That 's where Quantum Volume comes in . It analyzes the collective performance and efficiency of these factors then produces a single , easy-to-understand Quantum Volume number . The larger the number , the more powerful the quantum computer . <p> Demonstrated incremental improvements <p> Quantum Volume can be used to compare the power of one quantum computer to another . It can also play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create bigger and better quantum computers to achieve a quantum advantage . <p> IBM Quantum Volume Growth <p> IBM <p> IBM tested Quantum Volume on three of its quantum computers . The test included the following : the Tenerife five-qubit computer released through the IBM Q Experience quantum cloud service in 2017 , the 20-qubit Tokyo 2018 computer , and the 20-qubit 2019 IBM Q System One . <p> Jay Gambetta , IBM Vice President , Quantum Computing , posted graphs online showing progressive improvement in CNOT error rates as a result of various changes . In the post , he said : "" With four revisions of our 20-qubit quantum system ( chip name "" Penguin "" ) plotted together , you can really see the progress in stability , scalability , and reduction of errors over the last two years . "" <p> When asked for more detail on how Quantum Volume assisted in these improvements , the IBM research team said : "" These plots are a great example of why qubit counts alone do not tell the whole story . Over several revisions of the architecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown in the plots ; and that has a significant impact on improving quantum volume from revision to revision . There are many other performance metrics and architectural choices that impact the quantum volume of a system as well - for instance how the qubits are laid out and connected to one another . Maximizing quantum volume is about making trade-offs between these different parameters - and identifying new ways to push those boundaries . This is why the quantum volume metric is so important ; otherwise it would be quite possible to drive a couple of parameters to report on publicly yet to the detriment of overall quantum volume as it can be measured in a single system . "" <p> Optimizing with Quantum Volume <p> For the foreseeable future , quantum computers will use noisy qubits with relatively high error rates and short coherence times . We are still in the experimental stages of error correction . We know functional error correction will likely require a thousand or more error-correction qubits for every computational qubit . Decoherence of quantum states is a significant obstacle we will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simple logic and the Quantum Growth Chart tells us that to reach quantum advantage by 2025 , we need quantum computers with much higher Quantum Volumes , perhaps with a numerical value of 1000 or more . <p> Along these lines , in response to my earlier question , the IBM research team also said , "" Maximizing quantum volume is about making trade-offs between these different parameters - and identifying new ways to push those boundaries . This is why the quantum volume metric is so important ; otherwise it would be quite possible to drive a couple of parameters to report on publicly yet to the detriment of overall quantum volume as it can be measured in a single system . "" <p> Quantum Volume and the quantum computing ecosystem <p> Most of today 's benchmarking is done at the component level for qubits and quantum logic gates . There have been other benchmarking methods investigated as described in this excerpt from IBM 's paper on Quantum Volume : <p> "" Methods such as randomized benchmarking , state and process tomography , and gate set tomography are valued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet they fail to account for errors arising from interactions with spectator qubits . Given a system such as this , whose individual gate operations have been independently calibrated and verified , how do we measure the degree to which the system performs as a general-purpose quantum computer ? We address this question by introducing a single-number metric , the quantum volume , together with a concrete protocol for measuring it on near-term systems . Similar to how LINPACK and improved benchmarks are used for comparing diverse classical computers , this metric is not tailored to any particular system , requiring only the ability to implement a universal set of quantum gates . "" <p> IBM Research <p> Since quantum computing is now in a zone between quantum supremacy and quantum advantage , interim quantum computing performance benchmarks are now needed more than ever . The use of Quantum Volume offers many readily available operational and business benefits to gate-based and circuit-based quantum computer companies . <p> IBM 's published results demonstrate Quantum Volume 's benefits . It can facilitate research , help develop system roadmaps , and help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage and beyond . <p> Every researcher understands that funding for quantum computing research requires a favorable opinion of the technology by the general public . Unfortunately , because of quantum complexity and long intervals between significant announcements , the general public understands very little about quantum computing . Wider wide use of Quantum Volume would provide the public with a better feel for progress and generate more public interest . <p> Quantum Volume would also benefit the CEO or investor who lacks the in-depth technical knowledge necessary to make confident investment decisions in the technology . Additionally , reported variations in Quantum Volume from company to company would likely stimulate more articles by the media , which would serve to educate the general public further . <p> Summary <p> There should be no question that the development and ongoing support of Quantum Volume demonstrates IBM 's long-term commitment to the overall quantum computing ecosystem . <p> Organizations like the IEEE need to assist in the long-term evolution and development of quantum computing benchmarks . Unfortunately , it will take years to complete investigations , documentation , and negotiation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many benefits to using Quantum Volume . Moor Insights &amp; Strategy believes it is a powerful tool that should be adopted as an interim benchmarking tool by other gate-based quantum computer companies . When the time comes , it should also be considered by IEEE as a permanent standard ."
"<p> On June 22nd , visitors to Slate Star Codex , a long-standing blog of considerable influence , discovered that the site 's cerulean banner and graying WordPress design scheme had been superseded by a barren white layout . In the place of its usual catalogue of several million words of fiction , book reviews , essays , and miscellanea , as well as at least as voluminous an archive of reader commentary , was a single post of atypical brevity . "" So , "" it began , "" I kind of deleted the blog . Sorry . Here 's my explanation . "" The farewell post was attributed , like virtually all of the blog 's entries since its inception , in 2013 , to Scott Alexander , the pseudonym of a Bay Area psychiatrist -- the title "" Slate Star Codex "" is an imperfect anagram of the alias -- and it put forth a rationale for this online self-immolation . <p> "" Last week I talked to a New York Times technology reporter who was planning to write a story on Slate Star Codex , "" the post continued . "" He told me it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interesting gathering place for people in tech , and how we were ahead of the curve on some aspects of the coronavirus situation . "" In early March , Alexander had suggested that his readers begin to prepare for potential catastrophe , and his extensive review of the available medical literature led him to the conclusion that , despite the early guidance by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the contrary , masks were likely to prove more useful than not . A month later , he looked back at his forecast and awarded himself a "" solid B- "" -- not perfect , but at least more accurate than the news media , which , with some notable exceptions , he wrote , "" not only failed to adequately warn its readers about the epidemic , but actively mocked and condescended to anyone who did sound a warning . "" Journalists , in his view , were guilty of an inability or a refusal to weight the possible outcomes . As he put it , if there was even a ten per cent risk of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Alexander , who prefaces some of his own posts with an "" epistemic status , "" by which he rates his own confidence in the opinions to follow , thought the media , too , should present its findings in shades of gray . <p> The final post went on , "" It probably would have been a very nice article . Unfortunately , he told me he had discovered my real name and would reveal it in the article , ie doxx me . "" Alexander explained that he has a variety of reasons to prefer that his real name , which can be ascertained with minimal investigation , be left out of the paper of record . As a psychiatrist , he suspects that his relationships with his patients could be compromised if they were made aware of his "" personal "" blog , which gets six hundred thousand monthly page views . The site , and the community it undergirds , has found itself embroiled in various disputes , and his longtime readers would have understood why he wished he 'd done more to camouflage his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients should the clinic for which he works decide to fire him . There was also , he added , the "" prosaic "" matter of his personal safety . One of his commenters had recently claimed to have been subject to a SWATting , a dangerous prank in which a police SWAT team is given false reason to descend with military force upon a victim 's home . Alexander 's living arrangement is communal , and his responsibility extended to his household . "" I live with ten housemates including a three-year-old and an infant , "" he wrote , "" and I would prefer this not happen to me or them . "" <p> Alexander 's appeals to the reporter 's conscience had been ineffective . "" He said that it was New York Times policy to include real names , and he could n't change that , "" he wrote . "" After considering my options , I decided on the one you see now . If there 's no blog , there 's no story . "" Alexander had taken his own work , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hope that the Times would either cancel the story or permit the use of his pseudonym . Should his readers like to help him , he went on , they might contact the technology editor , a veteran journalist based out of the paper 's San Francisco bureau . In a parenthetical aside , he asked that his supporters remain courteous : "" Remember that you are representing me and the SSC community , and I will be very sad if you are a jerk to anybody . Please just explain the situation and ask them to stop doxxing random bloggers for clicks . If you are some sort of important tech person who the New York Times technology section might want to maintain good relations with , mention that . "" This plea conformed with the online persona he has publicly cultivated over the years -- that of a gentle headmaster preparing to chaperone a rambunctious group of boys on a museum outing -- but , in this case , it seemed to lend plausible deniability to what he surely knew would be taken as incitement . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps the premier public-facing venue of the "" rationalist "" community , a group of loosely affiliated writers and respondents who first coalesced , in the mid-two-thousands , on sites dedicated to the prospect that , with training and effort , our natural cognitive biases can be overcome . Many of these people work in or around Silicon Valley -- as mathematicians , programmers , or computer scientists -- and their common interests tend to include artificial intelligence , transhumanism , an appreciation for the subtleties of statistical thinking , and the effective-altruism movement . <p> Alexander 's role in the community is difficult to encapsulate -- an e-book of his collected S.S.C . posts runs to about nine thousand pages -- but one might credit him with two crowning contributions . First , he has been instrumental in the evolution of the community 's self-image , helping to shape its members ' understanding of themselves not as merely a collection of individuals with shared interests and beliefs but as a mature subculture , one with its own jargon , inside jokes , and pantheon of heroes . Second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social norms of the subculture , insisting that they distinguish themselves not only on the basis of data-driven argument and logical clarity but through an almost fastidious commitment to civil discourse . ( As he puts it , "" liberalism conquers by communities of people who agree to play by the rules . "" ) If one of the bedrock beliefs in Silicon Valley is that the future ought to be determined by a truly free market in ideas , one emancipated from the influence of institutional incumbents and untainted by the existing ideological polarities , Slate Star Codex is often held up as an example of what the well-behaved Internet can look like -- a secret orchard of fruitful inquiry . <p> Alexander 's appeal elicited an instant reaction from members of the local intelligentsia in Silicon Valley and its satellite principalities . Within a few days , a petition collected more than six thousand signatories , including the cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker , the economist Tyler Cowen , the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt , the cryptocurrency oracle Vitalik Buterin , the quantum physicist David Deutsch , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Altman . Much of the support Alexander received was motivated simply by a love for his writing . The blogger Scott Aaronson , a professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin , wrote , "" In my view , for SSC to be permanently deleted would be an intellectual loss on the scale of , let 's say , John Stuart Mill or Mark Twain burning their collected works . "" Other responses seemed unwarranted by the matter at hand . Alexander had not named the reporter in question , but the former venture capitalist and cryptocurrency enthusiast Balaji Srinivasan , who has a quarrelsome Twitter personality , tweeted -- some three hours after the post appeared , at 2:33 A.M. in San Francisco -- that this example of "" journalism as the non-consensual invasion of privacy for profit "" was courtesy of Cade Metz , a technology writer ordinarily given over to enthusiastic stories on the subject of artificial intelligence . Alexander 's plea for civility went unheeded , and Metz and his editor were flooded with angry messages . In another tweet , Srinivasan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C.E.O.s : "" The New York Times tried to doxx Scott Alexander for clicks . Just unsubscribing wo n't change much . They can afford it . What will is freezing them out . By RTing #ghostnyt you commit to not talking to NYT reporters or giving them quotes . Go direct if you have something to say . "" <p> Advertisement <p> Other prominent figures in Silicon Valley , including Paul Graham , the co-founder of the foremost startup incubator , Y Combinator , followed suit . Graham did not expect , as many seemed to , that the article would prove to be a "" hit piece , "" he wrote . "" It 's revealing that so many worry it will be , though . Few would have 10 years ago . But it 's a more dangerous time for ideas now than 10 years ago , and the NYT is also less to be trusted . "" This atmosphere of danger and mistrust gave rise to a spate of conspiracy theories : Alexander was being "" doxxed "" or "" cancelled "" because of his support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he 'd recently written a post about his dislike for paywalls , or because the Times was simply afraid of the independent power of the proudly heterodox Slate Star Codex cohort . <p> The proliferation of such elaborate conjectures was hardly commensurate with the vision of Slate Star Codex as a touchstone of patience and disinterest . Alexander 's initial account of his exchange with Metz seemed to have seeded the escalation . For one thing , the S.S.C . code prioritizes semantic precision , but Metz -- if Alexander 's account is to be taken at its word -- had proposed not to "" doxx "" Alexander but to de-anonymize him . Additionally , it seems difficult to fathom that a professional journalist of Metz 's experience and standing would assure a subject , especially at the beginning of a process , that he planned to write a "" mostly positive "" story ; although there often seems to be some confusion about this matter in Silicon Valley , journalism and public relations are distinct enterprises . Finally , the business model of the Times has little to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , even if it did , no self-respecting journalist would conclude that the pursuit of clicks was best served by the de-anonymization of a "" random blogger . "" The Times , although its policy permits exceptions for a variety of reasons , errs on the side of the transparency and accountability that accompany the use of real names . S.S.C . supporters on Twitter were quick to identify some of the Times ' recent concessions to pseudonymous quotation -- Virgil Texas , a co-host of the podcast "" Chapo Trap House , "" was mentioned , as were Banksy and a member of ISIS -- as if these supposed inconsistencies were dispositive proof of the paper 's secret agenda , rather than an ad-hoc and perhaps clumsy application of a flexible policy . Had the issue been with Facebook and its contentious moderation policies , which are applied in a similarly ad-hoc and sometimes clumsy way , the reaction in Silicon Valley would likely have been more magnanimous . <p> Until recently , I was a writer for the Times Magazine , and the idea that anyone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a niche blogger because he did n't like paywalls , or he promoted a petition about a professor , or , really , for any other reason , is ludicrous ; stories emerge from casual interactions between curious reporters and their overtaxed editors . Perhaps Metz was casting about for something on Silicon Valley 's good sense on the coronavirus , found Alexander 's post , and thought he 'd look into it . ( Metz declined to comment on the record , and a spokesperson for the Times issued the following statement : "" We do not comment on what we may or may not publish in the future . But when we report on newsworthy or influential figures , our goal is always to give readers all the accurate and relevant information we can . "" ) <p> But the rationalists , despite their fixation with cognitive bias , read into the contingencies a darkly meaningful pattern . Alexander , whose role has been to help explain Silicon Valley to itself , was taken up as a mascot and a martyr in a struggle against the Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and others , was enlisted as a proxy for all of the gatekeepers -- the arbiters of what it is and is not O.K. to say , and who is allowed , by virtue of their identity , to say it . As Eric Weinstein , a podcast host and managing director at Peter Thiel 's investment firm , tweeted , "" I believe that activism has taken over . "" Here was the first great salvo in a new front in the culture wars . <p> The temperature of the reaction only seemed to climb as rumors spread that Metz 's interest in Slate Star Codex might not be limited to Alexander 's early warnings about the coronavirus . Messages from Metz , published on Twitter and Reddit , revealed that his overtures to S.S.C . figures had referred to the blog 's readership with such adjectives as "" powerful "" and "" interesting , "" and noted that S.S.C . was a "" hugely influential voice , not only with the tight-knit community in the comments , but with some very influential figures in Silicon Valley and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpreted , taken as a clue that the reporter might be working on something other than a light , flattering story . On July 1st , a Bay Area attorney whose Twitter bio reads "" Into Stoicism , engineering , blockchains , Governance Econ , InfoSec , 2A , "" tweeted , "" Some inside sources tell me @CadeMetz is running around asking if @slatestarcodex meetups were ' all white men ' and whether ' commenters were trying to recruit people into white supremacy . ' Words can not express how much I want to see @nytimes burn for this . "" Alexander 's supporters were working themselves into a tizzy about a story that had not been published and , for all they knew , never would be . Alexander told me , via e-mail , that he 'd "" gotten word that more of my enemies and people connected to embarrassing incidents in my life were interviewed , all after I went public with my blog post . "" After that , he chose to respond to only a few of my questions . <p> What would eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ futurist Listservs of the very early Internet era . But it took shape as an identifiable movement on a blog called LessWrong , which was created in 2009 and maintained by a machine-intelligence researcher and former Orthodox Jew named Eliezer Yudkowsky , an acerbic autodidact best known for an endless ur-text called the Sequences , as well as a two-thousand-page fanfic series called "" Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality . "" LessWrong was , among many other things , a forum for the expression of early concerns about the existential risk posed by runaway artificial intelligence , and it attracted such contributors as the Oxford researcher Nick Bostrom and the libertarian-leaning economist Robin Hanson , whose own blog , Overcoming Bias , served as a precursor . In time , the rationalist movement developed into a symposium for dispassionate , data-driven conversation about economics , philosophy , social science , and culture taken up in the spirit of logical serenity . Perhaps the largest share of its attention is devoted to metacognitive elucidations of the tools of reason , and the heroic effort to purge oneself of common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own private lexicon , one almost designed to be daunting to outsiders unfamiliar with the concepts of "" pareidolia "" or the "" motte-and-bailey fallacy . "" <p> Under the influence of Bay Area counterculture , a prominent fraction of the community extended to the offline world their disinclination to observe convention : they often live in communal settlements , experiment with nootropics , and practice polyamory . In "" The AI Does Not Hate You , "" an excellent overview of rationalist history and debate , the British journalist Tom Chivers notes with an avuncular warmth that most rationalists seem constitutionally incapable of ordinary small talk . They do , however , have a tendency to make any idle assertion into the subject of a proposition bet , a pastime that embodies their conviction that you can only think clearly about the expected value of an outcome if you have "" skin in the game , "" or a personal stake . ( Before the publication of Chivers 's book , Alexander wagered a thousand dollars that it would not present a negative image of the rationalist community , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contributor to LessWrong , and the center of rationalist gravity followed him , in 2013 , to Slate Star Codex . As a leading member of a community that views personal identity as theoretically immaterial to logical matters , he only occasionally finds it relevant to mention the details of his own life , but its contours are easy enough to find online . He is not yet forty . He grew up in Southern California and attended a leafy liberal-arts college in the Northeast , where he won scholarships for his undergraduate work in philosophy . He attended medical school abroad , did humanitarian service in Haiti , and lived in the Midwest before he fetched up in the Bay Area . Alexander has described himself as an "" asexual heteroromantic , "" and has also practiced polyamory , which is mentioned on the blog , and lives in some form of intentional community . He takes an annual survey of his readership and frequently reports on the patterns he discovers , especially when they diverge from expectations . "" The average IQ is in the 130s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are overrepresented , but so are LGBT and especially transgender people . "" <p> On the blog , Alexander strives to set an example as a sensitive , respectful , and humane interlocutor , and even in its prolixity his work is never boring ; the fiction is delightfully weird and the arguments are often counterintuitive and brilliant . He has frequently allowed that a previous position he 's taken is wrong -- his views of trans people are a major example -- and has contributed to the understanding , among people who like to be right about everything , that the gracious acceptance of one 's own error ( or "" failure mode "" ) ought to be regarded as a high-status move rather than something to be stigmatized . Alexander 's terminal commitment , he has said repeatedly , is to the "" principle of charity , "" a technical term he has borrowed , from the analytic philosophers W. V. O. Quine and Donald Davidson , and slightly repurposed to mean , as Alexander once put it , "" if you do n't understand how someone could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is more likely a failure of understanding on your part than a failure of reason on theirs . "" <p> Many rationalist exchanges involve lively if donnish arguments about abstruse thought experiments ; the most famous , and funniest , example , from LessWrong , led inexorably to the conclusion that anyone who read the post and did not immediately set to work to create a superintelligent A.I. would one day be subject to its torture . Others reflect a near-pathological commitment to the reinvention of the wheel , using the language of game theory to explain , with mathematical rigor , some fact of social life that anyone trained in the humanities would likely accept as a given . A minority address issues that are contentious and at times offensive . These conversations , about race and genetic or biological differences between the sexes , have rightfully drawn criticism from outsiders . Rationalists usually point out that these debates represent a tiny fraction of the community 's total activity , and that they are overrepresented in the comments section of S.S.C . by a small but loud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve Sailer , a peddler of "" scientific racism . "" <p> Alexander has long fretted over the likelihood that the presence of these fringe figures could tarnish the reputation of the blog and its community . In late 2013 , he published "" The Anti-Reactionary FAQ , "" a thirty-thousand-word post now regarded as one of his first major contributions to the rationalist canon . The post describes the world view of a group , centered around a figure called Curtis Yarvin , also known as Mencius Moldbug , whose "" neoreactionary "" views -- including an open desire for the restoration of feudalism and racial hierarchy -- contributed to the intellectual normalization of what became known as the alt-right . Alexander could have banned neoreactionaries from his comments section , but , on the basis of the view that vile ideas should be countenanced and refuted rather than left to accrue the status of forbidden knowledge , he took their arguments seriously and at almost comical length -- even at the risk that he might lend them legitimacy . Ultimately , he circumscribed or curtailed certain "" culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willingness to pursue orderly exchanges on objectionable topics , often with monstrous people , remains not only a point of pride but a constitutive part of the subculture 's self-understanding . <p> They have given safe harbor to some genuinely egregious ideas , and controversial opinions have not been limited to the comments . It was widely surmised within the S.S.C . community , for example , that the arguments in the engineer James Damore 's infamous Google memo , for which he was fired , were drawn directly from an S.S.C . post in which Alexander explored and upheld research into innate biological differences between men and women . ( As it turned out , the Damore memo was written before the post , but there was a noticeable overlap between them . ) It remains possible that Alexander vaporized his blog not because he thought it would force Metz 's hand but because he feared that a Times reporter would n't have to poke around for very long to turn up a creditable reason for negative coverage . <p> One of Alexander 's particularly controversial posts , written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of whether it was accurate to call the President 's racism "" overt . "" Alexander , despite his unambiguous distaste for the President and endorsement ( in swing states ) of Hillary Clinton , presented evidence for the semantic claim that Trump 's actions did not qualify as "" overt "" racism . ( Alexander is conscientious in his efforts to , as the community likes to put it , "" update his priors , "" and , since that post , he has not minced words about the President . ) In 2017 , Alexander identified himself as a member of the "" hereditarian left , "" defined as the ability to believe , on the one hand , that genetic differences play a determining role in human affairs and , on the other , that we ought to act as though they do n't . Often nothing at all appears to turn on such arguments . The rationalists regularly fail to reckon with power as it is practiced , or history as it has been experienced , and they indulge themselves in such contests with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mind-set of logical serenity , for all of the rationalists ' talk of "" skin in the game "" and their inclination to heighten every argument with a proposition bet , only obtains as long as their discussions feel safely confined to the realm of what they regard , consciously or otherwise , as sport . The sheer volume of Alexander 's output can make it hard to say anything overly categorical ( epistemic status : treading carefully ) , but there is some evidence to support the idea that he , like anyone , is wont to sacrifice rigor in moments of passion . ( The rationalists might describe the relationship as inversely proportional . ) One of Alexander 's most notorious essays was a thirteen-thousand-word screed called "" Untitled , "" a defense of Scott Aaronson , the Austin computer scientist and rationalist fellow-traveller . Aaronson had written that the charge of "" male privilege "" obscures and demeans the suffering of nerds in the sexual marketplace , and had been subject to online scorn by some Internet feminists . Alexander , moved to anger by Aaronson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at various points to be largely sympathetic to some of the women he mentions , he mostly deploys the term "" feminism "" as a tendentious umbrella term for the work of a small handful of online writers with whom he takes particular issue in one discrete instance . Later , Alexander apparently came to a similar conclusion and appended a disclaimer to the top of the post : "" EDIT : This is the most controversial post I have ever written in ten years of blogging . I wrote it because I was very angry at a specific incident . I stand by a lot of it , but if somebody links you here saying ' HERE 'S THE SORT OF GUY THIS SCOTT ALEXANDER PERSON IS , READ THIS SO YOU KNOW WHAT HIS BLOG IS REALLY ABOUT ' , please read any other post instead . "" <p> Advertisement <p> Since the 2016 Presidential election , a contingent of the media has been increasingly critical of Silicon Valley , charging tech founders , C.E.O.s , venture capitalists , and other technology boosters with an arrogant , na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a functional democracy , noting their tendency to disguise anticompetitive , extractive behavior as disruptive innovation . Many technologists and their investors believe that media coverage of their domain has become histrionic and punitive , scapegoating tech companies for their inability to solve extremely difficult problems , such as political polarization , that are neither of their own devising nor within their ability to solve . The Valley 's most injured , aggrieved , and single-minded partisans do n't want to be judged by the absurdity of Juicero , the much-ridiculed luxury-juicing startup , or the fraud of Theranos , or the depredations of Uber . As Paul Graham pointed out , in a 2017 tweet , it was unfair to condemn the entirety of the tech sector based on a few bad actors . "" Criticizing Juicero is fine , "" he wrote . "" What 's intellectually dishonest is criticizing SV by claiming Juicero is typical of it . "" ( The obvious irony -- that people like Graham nevertheless feel free to write off the entirety of "" the media "" on a similarly invidious basis -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tweet linked to a Slate Star Codex piece , also from 2017 , called "" Silicon Valley : A Reality Check , "" in which Alexander had collated the most triumphalist dismissals of Juicero and paired them with his own views of what actual technological innovation looked like . "" While Deadspin was busy calling Silicon Valley ' awful nightmare trash parasites ' , my girlfriend in Silicon Valley was working for a company developing a structured-light optical engine to manipulate single cells and speed up high-precision biological research , "" he writes . Alexander goes on , in the post , to allow that Silicon Valley is not above reproach , acknowledging that "" anything remotely good in the world gets invaded by rent-seeking parasites and empty suits , "" but argues that journalists at publications such as the former Deadspin do not understand that the "" spirit of Silicon Valley "" is "" a precious thing that needs to be protected . "" ( Deadspin , in its original form , did not survive the aftermath of Hulk Hogan 's lawsuit against its former parent company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which complicates the issue of who , exactly , needs protection from whom . ) He continues , "" At its worst , some of their criticism sounds more like a worry that there might still be some weird nerds who think they can climb out of the crab-bucket , and they need to be beaten into submission by empty suits before they can get away . "" <p> By then , six months after the election , Alexander had emerged as one of the keenest observers of technologists as a full-fledged social cadre , and of their sharpening class antagonism with an older order -- the institutions in New York , Boston , D.C. , and Los Angeles that Balaji Srinivasan has disparaged as "" the Paper Belt . "" ( Srinivasan 's Twitter bio reads "" not big on credentialism , "" a common posture in a place that likes to present itself as the world 's most successful meritocracy , although he provides a link that itemizes his connections to Stanford and M.I.T. "" if deemed relevant . "" ) This new group , Alexander suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anything Except the Outgroup , "" published in 2014 , sits at an odd angle to America 's extant tensions . In the essay , he describes our tendency to conceal the degree to which our beliefs and actions are determined by tribal attitudes . It is obvious , Alexander writes , that America is split in recognizable ways . "" The Red Tribe is most classically typified by conservative political beliefs , strong evangelical religious beliefs , creationism , opposing gay marriage , owning guns , eating steak , drinking Coca-Cola , driving SUVs , watching lots of TV , enjoying American football , getting conspicuously upset about terrorists and commies , marrying early , divorcing early , shouting ' USA IS NUMBER ONE ! ! ! ' , and listening to country music . "" He notes that he himself knows basically none of these people , a sign of how comprehensive our national sorting project has become . "" The Blue Tribe , "" by contrast , "" is most classically typified by liberal political beliefs , vague agnosticism , supporting gay rights , thinking guns are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving Priuses , reading lots of books , being highly educated , mocking American football , feeling vaguely like they should like soccer but never really being able to get into it , getting conspicuously upset about sexists and bigots , marrying later , constantly pointing out how much more civilized European countries are than America , and listening to ' everything except country ' . "" What 's crucial , he emphasizes , is that these are cultural differences rather than political ones -- an Ivy League professor might hold right-leaning beliefs , for example , but is nevertheless almost certainly a member of the Blue Tribe . <p> These are caricatures , of course , but Alexander 's crude reductionism is part of his argument , which is that these categories are drawn and redrawn in bad faith , as a way to disavow tribalistic rancor without actually giving it up . When , for example , members of the Blue Tribe censure "" America , "" they are purporting to implicate themselves in their criticism ; in reality , however , they are simply using "" America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that distinction explicit . What may sound like humility and self-scrutiny is , in fact , actually just a form of thinly disguised tribal retrenchment . <p> He introduces the idea of a third cohort in an aside : "" ( There is a partly-formed attempt to spin off a Grey Tribe typified by libertarian political beliefs , Dawkins-style atheism , vague annoyance that the question of gay rights even comes up , eating paleo , drinking Soylent , calling in rides on Uber , reading lots of blogs , calling American football ' sportsball ' , getting conspicuously upset about the War on Drugs and the NSA , and listening to filk -- but for our current purposes this is a distraction and they can safely be considered part of the Blue Tribe most of the time . ) "" This is clearly meant as a teasing description of the S.S.C . reader -- and , by extension , the Silicon Valley intellectual . Since the post was published , "" Grey Tribe "" has become a shorthand compliment paid to thinkers who float free of the polarized fiasco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not an encomium to the Grey Tribe ; it is his gentle reminder that most of its members , most of the time , share a vast portion of their political commitments with the Blue Tribe that they so often censure . He has been very upfront about this in his own case ; last year , he wrote , lest there was any confusion , "" I am a pro-gay Jew who has dated trans people and votes pretty much straight Democrat . "" Any sense of rivalry , he suggests , is likely reducible to the narcissism of minor differences . <p> The division between the Grey and Blue tribes is often rendered in the simplistic terms of a demographic encounter between white , nerdily entitled men in hoodies on one side and diverse , effete , artistic snobs on the other . On this account , one side is generally associated with quantification , libertarianism , speed , scale , automation , science , and unrestricted speech ; the other is generally associated with quality , progressivism , precaution , craft , workmanship , the humanities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulated essay , published in 2"

He has a passion for numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might make a superhero think twice . <p> "" I want to save the Earth , "" he says matter-of-factly . "" That seems like a very bold statement . But , I strongly believe that artificial intelligence ( AI ) can play an important role in monitoring the health of our planet . "" <p> Singapore-born and educated , Wee Hyong has been a data guy and techie all his working life -- first in academia , and later with Microsoft in China and the United States where he helped create ground-breaking products in the cloud . <p> For more than a year now , he has been leading an elite global research team for AI for Earth -- a five-year , US$50 million Microsoft initiative that supports , and partners with , environmental groups and researchers . They are tackling some of the world 's most intractable problems by marshalling the immense power of AI , machine learning ( ML ) , and the cloud . <p> In a recent interview during a quick visit back to Singapore , Wee Hyong summed up the challenge : We live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . <p> We have limited time to learn how to conserve its resources . Fresh water supplies are being dangerously overexploited . Land is being exhausted and degraded to produce more food for more people in ever-growing cities . Thousands of species are fading fast into extinction as their habitats disappear in a whirl of industrialisation and a haze of pollution . The oceans are choking on plastics and the carbon-charged climate is changing . Precious things that are vital to our existence are under threat and , if lost , might never come back . <p> When we hear such things , most of us tend to shrug helplessly . Such problems just seem too big , too hard , and too scary to fix . But Wee Hyong and his colleagues at AI for Earth and Microsoft Research are convinced that solutions can come in our time -- if data , technology , and imagination are put to work . <p> "" I am an optimist , "" he says before describing the technical complexities surrounding his team 's quest . "" We can learn how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing humanity today . "" <p> Boiled down , AI for Earth aims to create sustainable solutions across four areas that are key to the health of the planet and the future of humankind : agriculture , water , biodiversity , and climate change . <p> Wee Hyong proudly points to some early breakthroughs . The Farm Beats project is pioneering new data-driven agriculture to guide farmers in India and the United States on where and when to plant crops for the greatest yield . <p> Equally impressive are the strides being made in land cover mapping -- traditionally a time-consuming , expensive tool that is essential for environmental management and precision conservation . Recently , the entire United States was mapped by machine-learning algorithms that processed nearly 200 million aerial images in just over 10 minutes . Done the usual way , such a project would have taken many months and cost a fortune . Deployed globally and locally , this new way of mapping could revolutionise how we mitigate the effects of urbanisation , pollution , deforestation , and even natural disasters . <p> Endangered species are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of images taken from satellites , drones or camera traps in the wild to study the range , populations , and behaviours of animals otherwise rarely seen by humans . It 's laborious work that takes time , skill and concentration . "" Try spotting a herd of zebra on the African savannah from a satellite image , "" Wee Hyong says . "" It 's not easy . "" <p> Now computers can take on this role thanks to deep learning techniques that enable them to make sense of the thousands of pixels in an image . This is freeing up the expert time of scientists to do and study more . It 's already adding invaluable knowledge about elusive snow leopards in Kyrgyzstan in Central Asia and dwindling elephant populations in Congo in Africa where AI is also being used in the fight against the twin scourges of poaching and the ivory trade . <p> Project Premonition uses insects as de facto "" field biologists "" . The project uses AI to analyse blood that mosquitoes take from animals across an ecosystem to glean valuable data . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that autonomously locate mosquito hotspots , robotic traps to collect specimens , and cloud-scale genomics and machine learning algorithms to identify each animal bitten . <p> The rise of the intelligent cloud and the ability to deploy machine learning models to the intelligent edge is accelerating and enabling new exciting possibilities to study and save wildlife from the remotest corners of the Earth to suburban backyards . <p> Pursuing research is worthy in itself , but real value comes when a solution is launched into action in the real world . It is here that Wee Hyong 's motivation shines through : He wants to leave the world in better shape for his two children -- and for all children in the world . <p> The same goes for his team of data scientists and software engineers who left exciting and satisfying roles in commercial product development to join AI for Earth . <p> "" Every single person who came for a job interview said they wanted to be able to tell their kids and families that they were serving a higher purpose . It goes beyond just technology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and approaches , or whatever . They want to tell their kids they are trying to save"

"<h> Has RBI 's Ban On Bitcoin Killed The Future of Cryptocurrency In India ? <p> After the Reserve Bank of India , the central banking institution which controls the monetary policy of the Rupee , clamped down on Bitcoin , the cryptocurrency sector has been rife with challenges . Earlier this year in April , RBI banned on dealing with virtual currencies , both cryptocurrencies and crypto assets , since such transactions raised concerns about money laundering , consumer protection and market integrity . The RBI had also cautioned users against the trading and use of cryptocurrencies . <p> Advertisement <p> Then came another blow to blockchain with news about Zebpay , India 's first and most trusted and secured bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange , shutting down their operations in India . The company moved its base from India to Malta . Despite the Government 's stance on the utilisation of blockchain technology , the cryptocurrency market in India has seen low transactions and P2P transactions . <h> The Aftermath Of The Ban <p> The current regulations clearly indicate that the ban will reduce the exposure to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum and will also limit the growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spurt in the number of blockchain startups in India , the explosion of cryptocurrency is fraught with several challenges . Banks have also prohibited their customers from using their credit or debit cards for investing in cryptocurrency .

The Internet and Mobile Association of India formed a committee to identify the challenges and opportunities in the blockchain sector and work with the Government <p> This committee features representatives from leading companies such as IBM , Microsoft , Mastercard , and Zebpay . The committee has been formed to deliver a positive impact in the cryptocurrency community and help the government to re-formulate some regulations imposed on the market during this and the last year . <p> The key point is , despite its promise and several use cases , especially in the finance sector , which is the first to benefit from distributed ledger technologies , blockchain technology is facing immense challenges in India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is At An All-Time High <p> While it is still too early to comment on the demise of cryptocurrency in India , the technology will only take off after the Government 's intervention and regulatory policies are put in place .

"<h> Artificial intelligence in schools : an ethical storm is brewing <p> Last week the Australian Government Department of Education released the world-first research report into artificial intelligence and emerging technologies in schools . It is authored by an interdisciplinary team from the University of Newcastle , Australia . <p> As the project lead , and someone interested in carefully incubating emerging technologies in educational settings to develop an authentic evidence-base , I relished the opportunity to explore the often-overlooked ethical aspects of introducing new tech in to schools . To this end , I developed a customised ethical framework designed to encourage critical dialogue and increased policy attention on introducing artificial intelligence into schools . <p> We used to think artificial intelligence would wheel itself in to classrooms in the sci-fi guise of a trusty robo-instructor ( a vision that is unlikely to come true for some time , if ever ) . What we did n't envisage was how artificial intelligence would become invisibly infused into the computing applications we use in everyday life such as internet search engines , smartphone assistants , social media tagging and navigation technology , and integrated communication suites . <p> I want to tell you about artificial intelligence in schools , give you an idea of the ethical dilemmas that our educators are facing and introduce you to the framework I developed . <h> What is AI ( artificial intelligence ) ? <p> Artificial intelligence is an umbrella term that refers to a machine or computer program that can undertake tasks or activities that require features of human intelligence such as planning , problem solving , recognition of patterns , and logical action . <p> While the term was first coined in the 1950s , the new millennium marked rapid advancement in AI driven by the expansion of the Internet , availability of ' Big Data ' and Cloud storage and more powerful computing and algorithms . Applications of AI have benefited from improvements in computer vision , graphics processing , and speech recognition . <p> Interestingly , adults and children often overestimate the intelligence and capability of machines , so it is important to understand that right now we are in a period of ' narrow AI ' which is able to do a single or focused task , sometimes in ways that can outperform humans . The diagram below from our report ( adapted from an article in The Conversation by Arend Hinz , Michigan State University ' s Assistant Professor of Integrative Biology &amp; Computer Science and Engineering ) provides an overview of types of AI and current state-of-play : <h> AI in education <p> In education , AI is in some intelligent tutoring systems and powers some pedagogical agents ( helpers ) in educational software . It can be integrated into the communication suites marketed by Big Tech ( for example in email ) and will increasingly be part of learning management systems that present predicative and data-driven performance dashboards to teachers and school leaders . There is also some ( very concerning ) talk of integrating facial recognition technology into classrooms to monitor the ' mood ' and ' engagement ' of students despite research suggesting that inferring affective states from facial expression is fraught with difficulties . <p> Engaging with AI in education also involves an understanding of machine learning ( ML ) , whereby algorithms can help a machine learn to identify patterns in data and make predictions without having pre-programmed models or rules . <h> Worldwide concern about the ethics of AI and ML <p> The actual and conceivable ethical implications of AI and ML have been canvassed for several decades . Since 2016 , the US , UK and European Union have conducted large scale public inquiries which have grappled with question of what a good and just AI society would look like . <p> What does it mean for an AI system to make a decision ? What are the moral , societal and legal consequences of their actions and decisions ? Can an AI system be held accountable for its actions ? How can these systems be controlled once their learning capabilities bring them into states that are possibly only remotely linked to their initial , designed , setup ? Should such autonomous innovation in commercial systems even be allowed , and how should use and development be regulated ? <h> Most pressing ethical issues for education <p> Some of the most pressing ethical issues related to AI and ML in general , and especially for education include : <p> AI bias <p> AI bias where sexist , racist and other forms of discriminatory assumptions are built into the data sets that are used to train machine-learning algorithms that then become baked into AI systems . Part of the problem is the lack of diversity in the computing profession where those that develop AI systems fail to identify the potential for bias or do not adequately test in different populations across the lifecycle of development . <p> Black box nature of AI systems <p> The ' black box ' , opaque nature of AI systems is complicated . AI is ' opaque ' because it is often invisibly infused into computing systems in ways that can influence our interactions , decisions , moods and sense of self without us being aware of this . <p> The ' black box ' of AI is twofold : The proprietary nature of AI products creates a situation where industry does not open up the workings of the product and its algorithms for public or third party scrutiny . In cases of deep machine learning there is an autonomous learning and decision-making process which occurs with minimal human intervention , with this technical process being so complicated that even the computer scientists that have created the program can not fully explain why the machine came to a decision it did . <p> Digital human rights issues <p> Digital human rights issues related to the harvesting the ' Big Data ' used in ML where humans have not given informed consent or where data is used in ways that were not consented to . Issues of consent and privacy extends to the surreptitious collection , storage and sharing of biometric ( of the body ) data . Biometric data collection represents a threat to the human right to bodily integrity and is legally considered sensitive data that require a very careful and fully justified position before implementation , especially with vulnerable populations such as children . <p> Deep fakes <p> We are in a world of ' deep fakes ' and AI-produced media that ordinary ( and even technologist ) humans can not discern as real or machine-generated . This represents a serious challenge and interesting opportunities to teaching and practicing digital literacy . There are even AI programs that produce more than passable written work on any topic . <p> The potential for a lack of independent advice for educational leaders making decisions on use of AI and ML <p> Regulatory capture is where those in policy and governance positions ( including principals ) become dependent on potentially conflicted commercial interests for advice on AI-powered products . While universities may have in-house expertise or the resources to buy-in independent expertise to assess AI products , principals making procurement decisions will probably not be able to do this . Furthermore , it is incumbent on educational bureaucracies to seek independent expert advice and be transparent in their policies and decision-making regarding such procurement so that school communities can have trust that the technology will not do harm through biased systems or by violating teacher and students sovereignty of their data and privacy . <h> Our report offers practical advice <p> Along with our report , the project included infographics on Artificial Intelligence and virtual and augmented reality for students , and ' short read ' literature reviews for teachers . <p> In the report we carefully unpack the multi-faceted ethical dimensions of AI and ML for education systems and offer the customised Education , Ethics and AI ( EEAI ) framework ( below ) for teachers , school leaders and policy-makers so that they can make informed decisions regarding design , implementation and governance of AI-powered systems . We also offer a practical ' worked example ' of how to apply it . <p> While it is not possible to unpack it all in a blog post , we hope Australian educators can use the report to lead the way in using AI-powered systems for good and for what they are good for . <p> We want to avoid teachers and students using AI-systems that ' feel more and more like magic ' and where educators are unable to explain why a machine made a decision that it did in relation to student learning . The very basis of education is being able to make ' fair calls ' and to transparently explain educational action and , importantly , to be accountable for these decisions . <p> When we lose sight of this , at a school or school-systems level , we find ourselves in questionable ethical and educational territory . Let 's not disregard our core strength as educators in a rush to appear to be innovative . <p> We are confident that our report is a good first step in prompting an ongoing democratic process to grapple with ethical issues of AI and ML so that school communities can weather the approaching storm . <p> Erica Southgate is an Associate Professor of Education at the University of Newcastle , Australia .

And once this process is used for feature updates , quality updates become a lightweight procedure that is simple and fast to execute , ultimately increasing velocity . <p> When you move to a service management model , you need effective ways of rolling out updates to representative groups of devices , and we 've found that ring-based deployment is a methodology that works well for us at Microsoft and many other organizations across the globe . Deployment rings in Windows 10 are similar to the deployment groups most organizations constructed for previous major revision upgrades--they are simply a method by which to separate devices into a deployment timeline . <p> At the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users or devices that receive a particular update concurrently . For each ring , IT administrators set criteria to control deferral time or adoption ( completion ) that should be met before deployment to the next broader ring of devices or users can occur . <p> A common ring structure comprises three deployment groups : <p> Preview : Planning and development <p> Limited : Pilot and validation <p> Broad : Wide deployment <p> ! NOTE Organizations often use different names for their "" rings , "" for example : <p> First &gt; Fast &gt; Broad <p> Canaries &gt; Early Adopters &gt; Users <p> Preview &gt; Broad &gt; Critical <h> How many rings should I have ? <p> There are no definite rules for exactly how many rings to have for your deployments . As mentioned previously , you might want to ensure zero downtime for mission-critical devices by putting them in their own ring . If you have a large organization , you might want to consider assigning devices to rings based on geographic location or the size of rings so that helpdesk resources are more available . Consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your organization . <h> Advancing between rings <p> There are basically two strategies for moving deployments from one ring to the next . One is service based , the other project based . <p> "" Red button "" ( service based ) : Assumes that content is good until proven bad . Content flows until an issue is discovered , at which point the IT administrator presses the "" red button "" to stop further distribution . <p> Green button ( project based ) : Assumes that content is bad until proven good . Once all validation has passed , the IT administrator presses the "" green button "" to push the content to the next ring . <p> When it comes to deployments , having manual steps in the process usually impedes update velocity , so a "" red button "" strategy is better when that is your goal . <h> Preview ring <p> The purpose of the Preview ring is to evaluate the new features of the update . This is specifically not for broad parts of the organization but is limited to the people who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrators . Ultimately , this is the time the design and planning work happens so that when the public update is actually shipped , you can have greater confidence in the update . <p> !

In many cases , the fetal DNA ( from chorionic villi , amniotic fluid , or abortive tissue ) can be contaminated with maternal cells , resulting in the mixture of fetal and maternal DNA . This maternal cell contamination ( MCC ) undermines the assumption , made by traditional variant callers , that each allele in a heterozygous site is covered , on average , by 50% of the reads , and therefore can lead to erroneous genotype calls . We present a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of MCC . All methods start with the output of GATK HaplotypeCaller on the sequencing data for the ( contaminated ) fetal sample and both of its parents , and additionally rely on information about the MCC fraction ( which itself is readily estimated from the high-throughput sequencing data ) . The first of these methods uses a Bayesian probabilistic model to correct the fetal genotype calls produced by MCC-unaware HaplotypeCaller . The other two methods "" learn "" the genotype-correction model from examples . We use simulated contaminated fetal data to train and test the models . Using the test sets , we show that all three methods lead to substantially improved accuracy when compared with the original MCC-unaware HaplotypeCaller calls . We then apply the best-performing method to three chorionic villus samples from spontaneously terminated pregnancies . <h> Introduction <p> High-throughput sequencing of fetal DNA is increasingly being used in academic and clinical settings . It is a powerful tool with the potential for use in prenatal diagnosis based on chorionic villus or amniotic fluid sampling 1 , or in the analysis of chorionic villi or products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In prenatal diagnosis , whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing can discover novel clinically significant variants that are not present in SNP arrays or gene panels , resulting in higher diagnostic yield 2 . Prenatal sequencing can inform prenatal and postnatal care and counseling , and may lead to prenatal therapeutic interventions 2 . In standard practice , the DNA of both parents is sequenced together with fetal DNA ( "" trio sequencing "" ) in order to establish patterns of inheritance and inform variant prioritization and interpretation . A technical difficulty that may arise in the analysis of fetal DNA is the contamination of the fetal sample with maternal cells . The prevalence of such maternal cell contamination ( MCC ) can be significant , depending on the experimental technique and quality of the sample ; for example , one study reported 9.1% of amniotic fluid samples as having detectable MCC 3 , while another found MCC fraction ? &gt; ? 5% in as many as 26% of amniotic fluid samples under some practices 4 . High-level contamination ( over 20% ) was detected by one study 5 in a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amniotic fluid samples and 1.3% of cultured chorionic villus samples ; it must be noted that cultured amniotic fluid samples generally have less MCC than direct samples ) . In traditional prenatal analysis , such as that aimed at detecting chromosomal aberrations , MCC is assayed by special tests , such as the short tandem repeat ( STR ) analysis , and , if detected at a sufficient level , may nullify the analysis 6 . <p> Meanwhile , standard variant-calling software that is used to analyze next-generation sequencing data relies on the expectation that each allele is represented by half of the reads . MCC disrupts this assumption , leading to errors in variant calling . In this work , we propose and evaluate computational methods for reducing the MCC-caused error . All of these methods begin with variants called in the fetal specimen , the mother , and the father by a standard variant-calling pipeline and then "" correct "" the results from the fetal specimen . The first method uses a Bayesian estimator to decide on the "" true "" fetal genotype based on the called genotypes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the best way to uncover the "" true "" fetal genotype from the maternally contaminated observed specimen data and instead solve this problem using machine learning . We train these methods on synthetic "" mother -- father -- fetus "" trios generated from real family trios by adding specified numbers of maternal reads to the child sample . We use these synthetic trios , where the child 's genotype is known , to demonstrate that MCC correction significantly improves the accuracy of variant calling compared with contamination-naive calling , especially for higher fractions of MCC . As an intermediate technical step , we present a simple heuristic algorithm for estimating maternal cell-contamination fraction in the fetal sample . We then apply the trained model to real sequencing data from a miscarried fetus with 40% estimated MCC , changing the fetal calls for a substantial number of SNPs . <h> Materials and methods <p> In the rest of the paper , we use the term specimen to denote the obtained fetal sample that may be contaminated with maternal cells . In practice , it can be a chorionic villus or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume that DNA samples are available for all three members of the trio . We expect the trio to be sequenced ( we gear our work towards and test it on Illumina whole-exome sequencing , currently the most widely used protocol in biomedical practice ) and the reads mapped and variant-called according to a standard bioinformatics pipeline , e.g. , one involving the Genome Analysis Toolkit ( GATK , 7 ) , although our approach can work with other calling pipelines too , as we show in section "" Strelka2 genotype correction "" . We expect that the called genotypes are available along with accompanying quality information , such as allelic depths , genotype likelihoods , and so on . The VCF file produced by the pipeline is the starting point for all our analyses ( see Fig. 1 ) . <p> NGS reads for each sample in the trio are mapped to the reference genome and the variants are called with GATK v3 . In the presence of MCC , the resulting VCF file contains incorrect calls for the fetus . To overcome this , we estimate MCC from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genotype calls for the fetus . Three different approaches for genotype correction were utilized ( see "" Materials and methods "" section ) : a restricted Bayesian method ( RB ) and two machine-learning-based approaches , namely , logistic regression and gradient boosted decision trees ( XGBoost ) . ML : machine learning . <h> Estimating the contamination fraction <p> We define the MCC fraction , which we denote by a ? 0,1 , to be the share of maternal DNA in the DNA of the fetal specimen . MCC accounts for the discrepancy between the results of variant calling on the contaminated specimen sample and the true fetal genotype . The MCC-aware genotype-correction methods presented below all rely on knowing the value of a , and it is vital to be able to estimate it accurately . <p> To estimate a in a fetal sample , we look at the results of variant calling by GATK HaplotypeCaller 7 and consider positions in the genome where the mother and the father are homozygous for different alleles ( i.e. , one of the parents is homozygous for the reference allele , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only consider biallelic sites . The fetus then should be heterozygous at these sites , with equal read coverage for the two parental alleles . <p> In the presence of MCC , however , the mother 's allele coverage fraction m should be higher , namely ( frac1 + a2 ) . Then , we can use the value of m at the position obtained from the VCF file to compute a as 2m ? - ? 1 . Since the actual coverage fluctuates , we average this ratio over all relevant sites to get the MCC fraction estimate . Let mi be the fraction of maternal reads at site i . Then , we compute ( hat m ) to be the average of mi over all sites i where the mother and the father are homozygous for different alleles , and estimate ( hat a = 2hat m - 1 ) . Only calls that pass basic filtering criteria ( GQ ? &gt; ? 30 in both parents , depth at site ? &gt; ? 10 in all three samples ) are considered in the calculation . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the reference allele ( "" mo00 "" ) systematically gives larger values than when the mother is homozygous for the alternative allele ( "" mo11 "" ) . We attribute this phenomenon to reference bias 8 . We , therefore , estimate a separately over the two alternatives ( "" fa00mo11 "" and "" fa11mo00 "" ) and compute the average of the two estimates as the final result . We found this aggregated estimate to be more accurate than either alternative . <p> Using simulated data ( see section "" Contaminated trio generation "" ) , we found that the MCC-estimation error made by this method does not exceed 2% and in the vast majority of cases is below 1% ( Fig . S6 ) . <p> While there are methods for estimating sample contamination that are geared towards detecting contamination with unrelated samples during sequencing and make use of population allele frequencies ( VerifyBamID 9 and the CalculateContamination module of the cancer-sequencing workflow in GATK v.4 ( https : **35;1258;TOOLONG ) ) , they are not well suited for the particular case of maternal contamination ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would underestimate contamination with maternal sample by half 9 . Our evaluation of these methods on simulated contaminated data generally agrees with this prediction , although we find it to be something of an underestimate itself , especially for large MCC fractions ( Fig . S6 ) . <h> Restricted Bayesian genotype correction <p> Our first method uses an explicit probabilistic model and the Bayesian approach . Let AD0 , AD1 denote the allelic depths of the reference and alternative variants in the mother-fetus mixture , and cGT , mGT , fGT denote the genotypes of the child , mother , and father , respectively . The joint probability of these variables is factorized as <p> Here , the P(mGT) and P(fGT) are prior probabilities of mother 's and father 's genotypes , P ( cGT ? ? mGT , fGT ) is the conditional probability describing Mendelian inheritance , and P ( AD0 , AD1 ? ? cGT , mGT ) is the conditional probability describing observations of reads in the mixture for given genotypes of mother and child . The prior probabilities P(mGT) and P(fGT) are available from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conditional probabilities are given by explicit formulas . From this representation , we can find the conditional probabilities P ( cGTAD0 , AD1 ) and hence determine the most likely genotype of the child given the allelic depths ; see section S3 for details . <p> Unlike a full-scale variant caller that has access to individual read data , we model all the read and alignment errors with a uniform error rate e ( see section S3 ) . We observe that setting e to a small but nonzero value does lead to an increase in accuracy ( Fig . S2 ) . <p> If contamination a ? = ? 0 , the predictions of the child 's genotype by the above Bayesian model should agree with the prediction of the standard pipeline applied to the mixture , but in reality we observe some discrepancy between the two ( Fig . S1 ) . This discrepancy is due in part to the Bayesian method 's lack of access to the individual read data , but also due to differences between the Bayesian model and the variant-calling algorithm . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the GATK pipeline leaves it until subsequent genotype refinement steps 10 , 11 . <p> As the purpose of this work is not to replace existing variant callers , but to correct the errors they make due to MCC , we focus on the scenarios where the standard variant-calling pipeline likely makes a mistake , and replace the original call by the Bayesian prediction in these cases only . Specifically , we observe that the disagreement between the child and fetal specimen variants is in the vast majority of cases due to the mislabeling of homozygous positions in the fetus as heterozygous in the contaminated fetal specimen ( Fig . S2 ) . This happens when the maternal genotype , and , accordingly , the mixture of fetal and maternal reads , is heterozygous . Following this observation , we define the restricted Bayesian model as follows : if both maternal and contaminated specimen 's genotypes ( as found by the standard variant caller ) are heterozygous , then the child 's genotype is recomputed using the above Bayesian model , otherwise it is left intact . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bayesian model and to using the uncorrected predictions ( Fig . S3 ) . <h> Machine-learning-based genotype correction <p> In this approach , the predictive model for genotype readjustment is trained using a machine-learning algorithm . The input to the model consists of two components : the estimated fraction of maternal DNA in the fetal specimen aglob , and the vector of features characterizing the variants called in the fetal specimen and the parents at a particular position in the genome ( practically , this is the line in the VCF file for that position ; it includes the genotype likelihoods , genotype qualities , allele-wise and total read depths , and the called genotype for all three samples ) . The output of the model is the corrected fetal genotype at this position in the genome . The fields describing the variant ( genotype likelihood , read depth , etc. ) need to be the same in the training VCFs and the VCF to be genotype-corrected ; therefore , the same or closely related variant callers should be used to produce all VCFs . To train and test the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of publicly available father -- mother -- child trios by randomly mixing mother and child reads at various MCC fractions , as described in "" Contaminated trio generation , "" and then use the genotype calls for the pure fetal sample as the "" ground truth "" in training . We considered two machine-learning algorithms : logistic regression ( as implemented in scikit-learn ( http : //scikit-learn.org/ ) and gradient boosted decision trees ( XGBoost implementation 12 ) . The inputs to the models are read from a VCF file and standardized and categorical features are one-hot encoded ( split into binary columns for each unique value the feature can take ) . L2 regularization is applied to both algorithms , along with a minimum loss reduction threshold for decision tree partitions and early stopping based on performance on a validation set used to prevent XGBoost from overfitting . We found both models to be robust to the choice of hyperparameters , and while these can be further tuned for a particular dataset , the performance gains are marginal and do not warrant the loss in generalizability it incurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training datasets by using publicly available exome reads from father -- mother -- child trios ( "" real-world trios "" ) to produce "" virtual specimen trios "" with predetermined maternal contamination fraction a . Namely , we mixed randomly selected reads from the "" real-world child "" and the "" real-world mother "" in such a proportion that the fraction of maternal reads would be a , and thus obtained "" virtual specimen "" reads . We used the remaining reads from the "" real-world mother "" to create the "" virtual specimen mother , "" while the "" virtual specimen father 's "" reads were identical to the original "" real-world father 's "" reads ( we split the mother 's reads into nonoverlapping "" specimen contamination "" and "" mother "" subsets to avoid using the same information twice ) . For each "" virtual specimen "" trio , we also generated a corresponding "" pure child "" trio , which was identical to the "" virtual specimen "" trio except that no mother 's reads were added to the child 's reads . We kept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the "" real-world "" trio and the "" virtual specimen trio "" to keep the amount of information available to the caller in both settings identical and the comparison as fair as possible . <p> We performed this procedure for four "" real-world "" trios with publicly available exome data : the Ashkenazim trio HG002NA24385 from the Genome in the Bottle project ( "" AJT "" ) 13 , the YRINA19240 trio from the 1000 Genomes project ( "" YRI "" ) 14 , the CHD trio ( "" CHD "" ) 15 , and the Corpas family daughter trio ( "" Corpas "" ) 16 . Since the child in the "" real-world "" trios was either a living individual ( AJT , YRI , Corpas ) or stillborn ( CHD ) , there was no MCC in the "" real-world "" reads . If the data were available only as a bam or cram file , we first obtained raw reads using the bam2FastQ program of the bamUtil package 17 . The CHD trio had a large number of read duplicates , which distorted the contamination fraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package ( https : **38;1295;TOOLONG ... and used the reads from the deduplicated file to generate the "" contaminated "" trio . <p> For each "" real-world trio , "" we repeated this procedure with a ? = ? 0.01 , 0.03 , 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.15 , 0.2 , 0.25 , 0.3 , 0.35 , 0.4 , 0.45 , and 0.5 . We aligned the "" virtual specimen "" and the "" pure child "" trio reads to the GRCh38DH reference genome following the 1000 Genomes pipeline 18 . Variants were called using GATK 3.8 HaplotypeCaller with the option -dontUseSoftClippedBases and restricting the sequence considered to Gencode v.24 protein-coding exons . <p> Table 1 shows for each trio the number of called variants and the coverage . Figure S1 shows the distribution of virtual specimen genotypes and its variation with MCC . <p> Table 1 The number of variants and range of coverage for each synthetic trio . The number of variants is given for MCC fraction 0.01 , and is reduced by up to 5% as MCC is increased to 0.5 . The edges of the coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtual specimen variant read depth in the 0.01 MCC trio . <h> Miscarriage samples <p> We analyzed DNA from spontaneously miscarried euploid abortuses . Internal Review Board approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Information Transmission Problems ( document 11616-2116/726 , 27/11/2017 ) and the Institutional Review Board of the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology ( 20/06/2019 ) . Families who suffered a miscarriage and requested chromosomal microarray analysis ( CMA ) of the embryo were offered the choice to participate additionally in the whole-exome sequencing study . Informed consent was obtained from the parents . Only cases without CMA-detected copy-number anomalies were considered for the WES study . Chorionic villi were used for the abortus DNA sample , while blood was drawn from both parents for sequencing . Parenthood and the presence of fetal DNA in the chorionic villus sample were verified using STR analysis with the COrDIS Plus system ( GORDIZ , Moscow , Russian Federation ) . Libraries were prepared using the TruSeq DNA Library Prep for Enrichment kit ( Illumina , San Diego , CA , USA ) . Exome capture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Integrated DNA Technologies , Coralville , IA , USA ) . Sequencing was performed on the HiSeq 4000 instrument ( Illumina , San Diego , CA , USA ) in paired-end mode . The reads were aligned to the hg19 reference genome . Calling was restricted to the Gencode v.2.7 protein-coding exons with 50-nt flanks . Otherwise , the mapping and calling procedure was the same as for the "" virtual specimen "" trios ( see "" Contaminated trio generation "" ) . <h> Results <p> We compared the genotypes corrected by each of the MCC-aware methods on the "" virtual specimen trios "" with the genotypes produced by the GATK HaplotypeCaller on the corresponding "" pure child "" trios , the latter serving as the ground truth . As a baseline , we also included the comparison with initial genotypes called by the GATK HaplotypeCaller on the "" virtual specimen "" trios ( "" no genotype correction "" ) . To control for possible artifacts that may result from experimental differences in the original sequencing of the real-world trios , including differences in coverage , we present the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each original family . <p> The machine-learning-based models were trained with a "" leave-one-out "" strategy , where every trio excluding the test trio was used for training . There are some input features that are strongly correlated , for example the genotypes and their associated likelihood scores . While this may present a challenge for the linear logistic regression model , gradient boosted decision trees are robust to multicollinearity by design . <p> Figure 2 summarizes the results , with the accuracy achieved by each method plotted against the contamination fraction . All three individual methods fare well , reducing the number of miscalled positions by 40 -- 80% over the baseline "" no genotype-correction "" approach . Both machine-learning approaches generally outperform the restricted Bayesian method and overcome some of its problems . XGBoost is the best performer . <p> Fig. 2 : Accuracy of the genotype-correction methods at various MCC fractions . <p> Machine-learning methods were trained with a "" leave-one out "" strategy . Each curve consists of twelve data points corresponding to accuracy of the method applied to "" contaminated specimens "" at various MCCs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "" Contaminated trio generation "" ) . The accuracy is calculated on the intersection of the calls made on the virtual fetal specimen and the calls made on the real-world child . <p> Restricting analysis just to indels similarly shows improvement in accuracy from genotype correction , even when training on non-indel variants ( Fig . S7 ) . <p> Figure S5 visualizes the accuracy of XGBoost as compared with no correction on a per-genotype basis . Note that in our two lowest-read-coverage trios , it seems that correcting the genotype with XGBoost results in a lower accuracy for heterozygous variants : the accuracy on uncorrected heterozygous variants is higher at the cost of mislabelling a significant number of homozygous variants as heterozygous . <p> We also compared the running times of the methods for both training and testing ( Table 2 ) . In terms of speed , the restricted Bayesian method , which requires no training , is the clear winner . The machine-learning methods take on the order of minutes to train . Once the models are trained , the times to genotype-correct a specimen are comparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods . Training includes training a model on the entire synthetic dataset . Running involves genotype-correcting a single VCF file ( 96,000 variants ) with a pre-trained model . The benchmarks were run on an Intel i5-7200U CPU @ 2.5 GHz . <p> As noted earlier , the training dataset needs to be sufficiently rich for machine learning to succeed at genotype correction . To demonstrate this , the two machine-learning algorithms were trained and tested on different pairs of families ( a "" one versus one "" approach ) , at all contamination fractions . The results are summarized in Fig . S3 . While the methods almost always lead to an improvement in accuracy , the gains are much more modest than when training with a "" leave-one-out "" approach ( Fig. 2 ) , due to overfitting to the features of a particular trio . This is particularly noticeable when correcting high-coverage trios with a model trained on a low-coverage trio . To combat overfitting , we ultimately adopted the approach where we train on all available trios except for the test one and added sufficient regularization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us about the discriminative power of our input features . Table 3 shows the top ten features ordered by discriminative power for both classifiers . It is interesting to note that the degree of contamination is not found among the top features for logistic regression . In addition , the father 's features are prominently toward the bottom of the table for logistic regression , yet are included in the top ten for XGBoost , suggesting some complex relationship that the linear model does not capture . XGBoost likely considers the heterozygosity of the specimen as a starting point while constructing decision trees ( which is consistent with the nature of genotyping errors , see Fig . S2 ) , but then prefers a combination of genotypic likelihood scores and allelic depths while proceeding . <p> Table 3 Top 10 most important features for machine learning methods in descending order . The parameters learned by the trained models ( the coefficients of the hyperplanes separating the different classes for logistic regression ; the degree of decision tree branching on each feature for XGBoost ) can give an estimate of relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( specimen , mother , father ) . <h> Robustness of the genotype-correction method <p> We explored the robustness of the XGBoost corrector performance to variations in the setup . First , since in practice , the MCC fraction is not known in advance , we investigated the robustness of the model to errors in MCC fraction estimate . We found that for the range of errors in the MCC estimate we obtained for the simulated specimens ( Fig . S6 ) , the decrease in performance is close to negligible ( Fig . S9 ) . <p> We then investigated the dependence of the genotype-correction method performance on read coverage and found that for positions covered by more than 80 reads , which is typical coverage for exome sequencing , the genotype-correction accuracy is close to maximal ( Fig . S10 ) . Finally , we investigated the effect of the choice of the reference genome on the performance of XGBoost . We tested the performance of the classifier with GRCh38 as the reference genome , and in settings where the classifier was trained on hg19-mapped data and tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Fig . S11 , the machine-learning approach is robust not only to the choice of the reference genome build , but also to changing the reference genome build between training and evaluation . Therefore , a model trained on one reference genome can be used to correct variants called with a different reference . <h> Strelka2 genotype correction <p> To test the performance of the genotype-correction framework on a variant caller other than the GATK HaplotypeCaller , we repeated the tests with the VCF files obtained using the recently published caller Strelka2 19 using its standard germline calling pipeline and the same VCF features as were available from GATK HaplotypeCaller . We observed the same trends , namely , that genotype correction increases the concordance between the calls on the "" pure child "" and the "" contaminated specimen "" trios ( Fig . S12 ) . <h> Application to clinical miscarriage data <p> We applied the MCC-estimation algorithm from section "" Estimating the contamination fraction "" to 33 abortus samples from a larger study aimed at finding genetic causes of spontaneous miscarriages of euploid fetuses ( data to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , the estimated MCC in the abortus exceeded 5% , with one case of 8% MCC and one of 40% MCC . We focused on the one abortus sample with the 40% MCC ( miscarried at 9 weeks ) as one where MCC-aware variant correction can have the greatest impact ( cf. Fig. 2 ) . We applied the recommended GATK hard filters 20 to the calls and further required that GQ be at least 30 for both parents . As a result , we obtained 65,431 calls by MCC-naive GATK HaplotypeCaller before genotype correction , of which 11,112 were genotype-corrected by the XGBoost ( trained on the "" virtual specimens "" ) . As we expected , all but one corrections affected the heterozygous genotype call . Also not surprisingly , correction predominantly affected heterozygous variants with skewed allelic depths and favored the "" elimination "" of the allele with the lower allelic depth ( Fig . S13 ) . <p> Contamination-aware genotype correction had several effects , both on the global variant statistics and on the particular list of candidate variants that could explain the pregnancy loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variants called in the abortus and brought it in line with that for the uncontaminated parent samples . Thus , the parents ' **26;1363;TOOLONG call ratio , as computed by the GATK 3 VariantEval tool , was 3.2 -- 3.3 , while for the MCC-naive abortus call set , it was 6.3 . After genotype correction , that number for the abortus was brought down to 3.0 , close to the parents ' value . Regarding the possible genetic explanation of pregnancy loss , the uncorrected call set contained six candidate compound heterozygote variants ( section S1 ; Table S1 ) . Of these , genotype correction eliminated two variant calls , which reduced the number of candidate compound heterozygotes to four . Thus , in this case , MCC-aware variant ( re- ) calling eliminated potential false positive candidate variants . <h> Discussion <p> As its costs are dropping , high-throughput sequencing is becoming increasingly routine in clinical and academic practice , and is gaining ground in prenatal diagnosis and in the diagnostic study of miscarried fetuses . While the bioinformatics toolkit for analyzing the sequencing data of individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the analysis of products of conception , which may be mixed with maternal tissue . We have shown that the accuracy of standard variant-calling pipelines does indeed degenerate as the MCC increases , but that much of this decline can be alleviated by MCC-aware variant genotype correction . We have demonstrated that the MCC fraction can be readily estimated from trio sequencing data and then used to inform the genotype correction . We have further shown , using synthetic contaminated samples obtained from real trio data , that even a simple method based on Bayesian statistics does much to correct for the MCC-related loss of calling accuracy , and that the machine-learning methods trained on simulated data show even greater improvement , with XGBoost having the best performance . <p> We note that all methods discussed in this paper only correct the variants that have been discovered by a general-purpose variant caller ( we used the popular GATK HaplotypeCaller , but any variant caller which outputs sufficiently rich information about variants into a VCF file should work ) . Therefore , MCC-aware genotype correction is a simple add-on to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by it . The user can then compare the original VCF with the corrected VCF to see which genotypes had been changed . On the other hand , the reliance on standard variant calling implies that if MCC had caused the true fetal variant to be missed in all members of the trio , then that variant will not be called by the genotype-correction pipeline , either . We expect such cases to be rare . <p> Among published methods , CleanCall 21 applies its own probabilistic model to correct for sample contamination , starting with read-level information , and it has an option for doing so with a known contaminating sample ( https : **34;1391;TOOLONG ) . Since our method works with the output of a third-party variant caller , and comparing it with CleanCall can not be decoupled from comparing CleanCall 's model with HaplotypeCaller 's , they are not directly comparable . Nevertheless , we believe that in the case of MCC with maternal sequence data available , our method is preferable , both because it is designed for that particular situation and because it allows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To show the applicability of our method to real-world data , we applied it to in-house exome sequencing data for a spontaneously miscarried euploid embryo with 40% maternal contamination and demonstrated that it can correct for contamination artifacts . <p> Currently , next-generation sequencing is applied to fetal DNA obtained by invasive methods that extract amniotic fluid or fetal or chorionic villi cells . Our work is aimed at the analysis of this sort of sequencing data , and we do not consider MCC fractions higher than 50% . As its costs drop , sequencing may become a practical option in noninvasive prenatal testing ( NIPT ) as well . NIPT analyzes fetal DNA circulating in maternal blood that constitutes a small fraction of the DNA sample obtained . Analyzing that sort of data would make MCC-aware variant calling a necessity , and may in fact give rise to more s"
"<h> What Matters Most to Oncology Patients ? <p> Lidia Schapira , MD : I 'm Lidia Schapira , associate professor of medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine . Joining me today is Ethan Basch , professor of medicine and public health at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill and director of the cancer outcomes research program at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center . <p> Your name is almost synonymous with patient-reported outcomes ( PROs ) . As I understand , PROs were first thought of as a mechanism for bringing the patient 's voice into the conversation and into research . Tell me about how they evolved . <p> Ethan Basch , MD : In general , PROs were previously referred to as "" quality of life , "" a field that you and I both have been involved with over the years . Many of the questionnaires or approaches for assessing quality of life , or patient symptoms , were developed for clinical trials -- to help us know , for example , whether a treatment for metastatic prostate cancer was improving pain related to castration-resistant metastatic disease . But as these tools evolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help with routine management of symptoms as well . <p> Schapira : How do we incorporate these patient-reported outcome instruments into routine follow-up of a patient in the clinic ? <p> Basch : There are a number of different ways that are appropriate to various contexts . But in general , in medical oncology or in radiation oncology settings , electronic tools have been used to send questionnaires to patients via a text message or an email to go online for a very brief questionnaire between visits . These let the practice know about key symptoms , such as pain or nausea or constipation -- the kinds of symptoms that are actionable for us as oncologists or as providers , but also symptoms that can really get patients into trouble . <p> Two thirds of patients have symptoms that meaningfully interfere with their lives . <p> An alternative is the in-clinic approach , and that 's also quite commonly used . In this approach , tablet computers are available in the waiting room , and the person at the front desk may bring them to a patient to fill out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care team at the visit . <p> Schapira : This seems like an opportunity also to find out what the patient 's quality of life is like between visits . We often ask patients about symptoms on the day they come to see us , perhaps for treatment , when most of the toxicity of the previous treatment may have resolved . But do clinicians in practice use these instruments on day 8 or day 15 , so that they actually can see what the quality of life has been for the patient during those interim times ? <p> Basch : One of the reasons we have seen so much interest in using this electronic symptom-monitoring approach in our patients during treatment is that patients receiving cancer therapy are highly symptomatic . The vast majority of people have symptoms , and about two thirds of them have symptoms that meaningfully interfere with their lives . They get dehydrated , have pain crises , or have dyspnea crises that lead them to the emergency department ( ED ) . <p> On top of that , a lot of research demonstrates that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' symptoms. 1,2 Even when we talk about symptoms in the office for various reasons , this information does n't rise to the top . As an oncologist , it 's not that infrequent that a patient will come in to see me and his daughter will say , "" Dad was in bed for 2 weeks after chemotherapy , "" and I say to the patient , "" Mr Jones , why did n't you call me ? "" And he 'll say , "" I did n't want to bother you , Doc . "" Or sometimes people will say , "" I thought that was normal , "" or "" I thought that was just part of the treatment . "" <p> There are all kinds of barriers . People do n't want to let their doctors down ; they do n't want to admit to having troubles . All kinds of dynamics are responsible for us not understanding what 's happening with our patients . <p> When I started , it was not uncommon for oncologists or clinical trialists to say , ' This will never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people between visits using these electronic approaches has grown . During active therapy with immunotherapy or cytotoxic or targeted therapy , in general , people are asked to report about every week . With some approaches , reporting is timed to the chemotherapies within a window after receiving treatment . Because there is so much variability in how cycles work and because that usually requires tethering to an electronic health record ( EHR ) , the every-week ongoing approach seems to be pretty effective . <p> Patients may get a prompt to self-report , and if they report something that is severe or worsening , the system will send a message , usually to a nurse who manages symptoms . Then , that nurse can react to that information . <p> Schapira : So a lot of steps need to be in place for this to work : the mechanism for pushing these out ; a portal for the patient to send the message back ; and a way for it to be incorporated into a dashboard or a workflow that then triggers a timely response by a clinician . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many practices to implement this complex system . What is the state of the art for implementing this in the community ? <p> Basch : As with any change we make in practice , these new value-based care approaches that try to improve the quality of the care we 're delivering and the patient experience require effort . In the case of patient-reported outcomes , it involves a technology lift and a modification of workflow , and of course , educating providers and a little culture change . <p> But as providers , our practices are accustomed to this kind of thing . We make changes all the time . Sometimes , they 're more painful than others : for example , EHR implementation . Sometimes , they 're easier . In this case , this is very much in keeping with the mission of our practices -- to improve the lives and the experiences of our patients . In addition , we know that these interventions reduce ED visits and hospitalization , and they lengthen the time that patients tolerate chemotherapy . There are a lot of benefits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It turns out there is tremendous enthusiasm . <p> But you are correct : It requires having a technology solution that would either mean working with a company or a vendor that provides PROs -- many are out there -- or doing this through the EHR . Many EHR systems include a PRO functionality . <p> But it also means figuring out who 's going to get these alerts , who 's going to get these reports , who 's going to discuss this with the patient , and who 's going to react . This generally requires piggybacking on top of the way we already manage symptoms . Usually , that may be related to the telephone triage approach , and oftentimes it 's nurses who oversee that , but it varies from practice to practice . So , a bit of thoughtfulness is required , but it 's quite feasible . <p> Schapira : What do patients and family caregivers say about this ? <p> Basch : When I started becoming involved in this work , it was not uncommon for oncologists or clinical trialists to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients are too sick , or they 're too well , or they 're not interested . There 's a reason that we as oncologists take on this role of trying to figure out what the symptoms are without asking the patients directly ; it 's because "" it 's just not going to work . "" <p> But it turns out that not only is it highly feasible , with the vast majority of patients being willing and able to do this , but there is tremendous enthusiasm . Many studies have been done with interviews and surveys of patients using these approaches , and it turns out that most patients feel more engaged in their care , feel more cared about , feel that they 're a part of the process , feel listened to by their team , and feel that their conversations with their doctors and nurses are improved . So there is generally a very high level of enthusiasm . It 's not universal , of course , as with anything , but the majority of people like this . <p> Schapira : I imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps prompt the patient to be more forthcoming in reporting symptoms . So it seems one of the intended or perhaps unintended consequences is that it improves communication . Do you think it also perhaps provides an opening for talking with patients when you actually see them in the office or clinic about their goals and what 's important to them ? <p> Basch : I believe so . The substance or the quality of conversations with patients have been found to be much more in line with the things patients care about and what is affecting them . Thus , there is much more efficient communication with patients because the things that are on the patients ' mind are foremost , and you can start there . It 's been found that there is no increase in the duration of clinic visits , but the content of the clinic visit is much more meaningful to patients . <p> And you 're right , these systems do n't only collect information about symptoms ; they now are starting to collect information about financial toxicity , transportation problems , barriers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are challenges for our patients and interfere with our ability to be effective as providers . So a secondary effect is that this provides an impetus to discuss these important areas with our patients . <p> Schapira : How can a community oncologist or practice know which instruments to choose to insert into their systems ? <p> Basch : Many of the available packages generally offer a set of items . Most of the systems collect a core set of symptoms that are the most common or troublesome symptoms , and many of them will include other areas , too -- for example , patient-reported ECOG ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) performance status , dehydration , or falls . <p> Packages have also been created for the postoperative setting . We have n't talked about that , but there are questions that ask about bleeding , wound problems , or fever . So depending on the context , generally some expertise comes along with it . That said , this field is still evolving and emerging . There is no true standard yet , and so I believe there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you see this going ? We talk about how new wearables or artificial intelligence may help us capture more data from patients . How could that affect the collection of data and reporting of data through these PROs ? <p> Basch : First , I believe there are various vehicles by which these systems will start to become more commonly used : for example , in the setting of alternative payment models or innovative ways of delivering value-based care . These approaches will become more widely used and integrated with other interventions , such as navigation or care coordination . <p> As this field evolves , you 're absolutely right , new technologies will bring us to version 2.0 , 3.0 , and 4.0 of this approach . The way the field has developed thus far is quite rudimentary . Static questions that are the same ones asked every single time become uninteresting to the patient after a while -- we know they do . <p> Some of the newer approaches are using Chatbox to have a more conversational or iterative approach . There is a beginning of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level , to direct the questions to the most problematic issues . There is some intelligence around alerting , to use predictive analytics to figure out which patients are truly at risk of winding up in the ED or missing a dose of chemotherapy because of the constellation of different variables . Certain diseases , treatments , clusters of symptoms , economic status , or insurance status may put them at very high risk and can perhaps flag a navigator or care coordinator to reach out proactively . <p> And the wearables , which I know you and I are both interested in as a way to passively collect information , may be a better way of collecting performance status so that we really know how active our patients are . <p> Schapira : It 's almost as if you can profile the patient , and from that , try to stay one step ahead of the problems by anticipating where they may run into trouble , pushing out some questions , and hopefully avoiding some of the unnecessary suffering and cost associated with cancer treatment . <p> Basch : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all do intuitively in our minds all the time . We look at a particular patient and we think , "" This person is not going to make it . "" Or , "" We 'd better give this person a call next week to see how they 're doing . "" So we are risk-stratifying people by weighing variables all the time . This is a way of improving the precision of something that we already do as providers . We already manage symptoms , we try to meet the needs of our patients , we try to communicate well with our patients and we try to tailor what we do to the needs of an individual person -- this is really just a way of being more scientific and systematic about it . <h> Comments <p> **36;264;TOOLONG <p> Commenting is limited to medical professionals .

"<p> It could be said that the job of bridge toll collector was invented in San Francisco . In 1968 , the Golden Gate Bridge became the world 's first major bridge to start employing people to take tolls . <p> But in 2013 the bridge where it all began went electronic . Of its small band of collectors , 17 people were redeployed or retired and nine found themselves out of work . It was the software that did it -- a clear-cut case of what economists call technological unemployment . Licence-plate recognition technology took over . Automating jobs like that might not seem like a big deal . It is easy to see how it might happen , just as how we buy train tickets at machines or book movie tickets online reduces the need for people . <p> But technology can now do many more things that used to be unique to people . Rethink Robotics ' Baxter , a dexterous factory robot that can be programmed by grabbing its arms and guiding it through the motions , sells for a mere $25,000 ( equivalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to a Stanford University study ) . IPsoft 's Amelia , a virtual service desk employee , is being trialled by oil industry companies , such as Shell and Baker Hughes , to help with employee training and inquiries . Meanwhile , doctors are piloting the use of Watson , IBM 's supercomputer , to assist in diagnosing patients and suggesting treatments . Law firms are using software such as that developed by Blackstone Discovery to automate legal discovery , the process of gathering evidence for a lawsuit , previously an important task of paralegals . Rio Tinto 's "" mine of the future "" in Western Australia has 53 autonomous trucks moving ore and big visions for expansion . Even the taxi-sharing company Uber is in on the act -- it has just announced it will open a robotics research facility to work on building self-driving cars . <p> Baxter is created by Rethink robotics and does manual tasks in factories . Needs a human trainer . Photograph : courtesy of Rethink Robotics <p> The upshot will be many people losing jobs to software and machines , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Robots comes out this year . He forecasts significant unemployment and rising inequality unless radical changes are made . Until recently , says Ford , such predictions risked you being branded a Luddite . <p> Based on past history , standard economic wisdom holds that technology creates as many jobs as it destroys and makes people better off by making goods and services cheaper . But , Ford adds , it is increasingly obvious that we are becoming less and less useful compared to machines . Every day , he says , brings new examples of technology set to spell the end of someone 's job . Nearly half of almost 2,000 experts recently surveyed by the Pew Centre said technology will have displaced more jobs than it creates by 2025 . <p> Under threat , stresses Ford , are not just the jobs of people who work with their hands but those who work with their minds , including professionals . "" Robots are n't just in factories threatening blue-collar workers , "" Ford says . "" It is really now anyone who sits in front of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- especially if it is more routine and formulaic . "" <p> As an example , he cites New York- based startup Work Fusion , which sells software to businesses to automate big projects that would previously have been done by office workers , such as updating company records or extracting specific information from internet websites . The software divides the job into micro-tasks , automates the repetitive bit then recruits freelance workers through crowdfunding platforms for tasks that require thinking . The remarkable thing about the system , notes Ford , is that as it manages these freelance workers it monitors what they are doing and learns from them so , over time , it can automate more and more : "" As the freelance workers do their jobs they are , in effect , training the system to replace them . That 's a pretty good preview of what the future looks like . "" <p> Of course most companies say the goal is not to replace workers but free them for other tasks . But Ford argues that technology combined with capitalism naturally tends towards making the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to find examples of people directly losing their jobs to automation like those on the Golden Gate Bridge , he adds . Most commonly , jobs are eliminated during an economic downturn and then , when the recovery comes , employers find technology allows them to avoid rehiring people . <p> Ford 's book is n't the first in recent times to sound alarm bells . It follows last year 's influential The Second Machine Age by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee , business school academics at the Massachusetts Insitutute of Technology ( MIT ) Sloan School of Management . They also warned we face significant overall job loss from computers , robots and automation unless we institute radical change . There is no economic law that says technological progress has to result in job creation and shared prosperity , they say . Rather , we are about halfway into a century-long transformation that moves us from merely automating physical work to automating mental work , a process that started with the first computer boom in the 1970s . The effects are just becoming noticeable now because exponential growth by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are better than humans in many tasks right now , from playing chess to legal discovery to medical diagnosis , "" says Brynjolfsson . "" That will just accelerate . "" <p> Artificial intelligence and machine-learning technology that allow computers to make decisions , recognise speech and visualise in 3D are the main driver of the process , says Ford . They are leading to the development of both algorithms and new robots that can perform all sorts of previously non-automatable tasks . <p> "" Little bits of artificial intelligence are all over the place now , "" says Murray Shanahan , a cognitive robotics expert at Imperial College London . For example : automated call systems that recognise voice commands . But what is coming is more sophisticated . When it comes to robots , he adds , most of the automation of manual tasks we have seen has occurred in highly engineered settings where the task can easily be specified for the robot without it having to understand the environment . We have had automation of car assembly lines for decades , but the whole plant has needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places -- so the robots can repeat mind-bogglingly precise tasks . But with AI boundaries can be pushed . Google 's self-driving car , which is essentially just a robot , is being taught to operate in the real , unpredictable world . <p> The question is what do humans do next ? When you automate the physical work you still need humans to be the control system , says Brynjolfsson . But when you automate the control system , "" then it is less clear what the role for humans is "" . Ford comments : "" There is n't another big sector of the economy to absorb all these workers . "" <p> The US has experienced measurable net technological unemployment for about the past decade and a half , Brynjolfsson and McAfee argue . Productivity ( the output for the labour input ) , private sector employment and median income have all risen roughly together . But in about 2000 a divergence began , which continues . Productivity has continued to increase while employment and median income have stagnated and even fallen . "" I call it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different pattern than what we have seen during the preceding 200 years , and the biggest single explanation is that technology has been affecting far more middle-skilled jobs . "" Concentrated in the middle it hollows out this group , making things more unequal . <p> To analyse the skills most affected , Brynjolfsson and McAfee categorise jobs as routine or non-routine and then again by whether they are cognitive or manual . The routine jobs -- both cognitive ( say payroll clerk ) and manual ( say assembly line worker ) -- are falling away most dramatically while the non-routine -- both cognitive ( say financial analyst ) and manual ( chambermaid ) -- have held up better so far because they turn out not to be simple and repetitive in a way that can be easily programmed . <p> But they note that the boundaries of what counts as routine and non-routine are moving all the time . It was once thought that driving was a skill so complex it could n't be automated only to see it turned on its head by Google and others . Dexterous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasks as well and skills such as medical diagnosis and legal analysis , once thought of as non-routine cognitive , are increasingly becoming automatable . <p> SaviOne is a robot butler that can take towels and food to guest rooms . Photograph : courtesy of Savioke <p> Michael Osborne and Carl Frey from Oxford University have put numbers to Brynjolfsson and McAfee 's job loss predictions . In a report published last year , they conclude that 35% of UK jobs were at high risk of disappearing in 10 to 20 years because of automation . ( An earlier study of the US , which has more manufacturing , suggested 47% of jobs were at high risk ) . They used a different method for estimating the vulnerability of occupations focused on the extent to which people 's jobs involved three types of task -- originality , social intelligence and interacting with complex objects in unstructured environments , which comes naturally to us but is hard for robots . The more a job involved those tasks , the less likely it was to become automated , they estimated . <p> Job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in office and administrative support ; sales and services ; transport ; construction and extraction ; and manufacturing . Among the highest risk jobs were telemarketers , payroll managers and wages clerks , bank and post office clerks , local government administrative occupations , assembly line workers , taxation experts , accountants , retail assistants and waiters . <p> We may even already have seen social unrest as a result of people losing jobs to technology , believe Brynjolfsson and McAfee , citing movements such as Occupy and the Tea Party . "" People feel they are not getting a fair deal , "" says McAfee . "" They blame different parties ... but there is this tectonic force in the background that I would call technological progress . "" Osborne and Frey 's job categories least at risk tended to be high ability and spanned skilled management ; financial services ; computing , engineering and science ; education ; legal services ; community services ; arts and media ; and healthcare . Among the lowest-risk jobs were : hotel managers , doctors , teachers , nurses , architects , lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , artists and journalists . <p> Not every component of the highest risk jobs may be automatable , says Osborne . For example , we may well make orders on tablet computers at restaurant tables , but staff will still bring the plates . Likewise , some components of low-risk jobs may incorporate elements of automation -- algorithms can now write simple finance and sports news stories once done by journalists , for example -- but it does n't mean those jobs will disappear anytime soon because of the skills they require . <p> "" I think a lot of the risk to professions has been overhyped , "" says Osborne . "" Yes some component of doctoring is going to be automatable , but a lot of what doctors do is interacting with people ... these algorithms will free them up to do more of that . "" Medicine will be an interesting test bed , says McAfee : "" There is a lot of potential for automation but also for resistance from patients , who do n't want to be diagnosed by a machine . "" <p> Yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economists . Jobs will always be "" destroyed "" by technological change , says David Autor , an economist at MIT , citing how there are not many train firemen ( they shovelled the coal into steam locomotives ) , typists and lift operators left in advanced economies . But this has not reduced employment in aggregate or lowered earnings levels on average . It has done the opposite : raised productivity on average and led to more interesting , more cognitively challenging , better paid and less dangerous jobs . <p> To focus on jobs destroyed is like writing a history of the economic impacts of the motor car that focuses entirely on the plight of blacksmiths and stable boys , he says . "" It sows panic without adding to understanding . "" Job displacement is highly disruptive and even traumatic for those who experience it , he notes , but in time new sectors open up . ( A figure of 35% of jobs at risk does not mean employment will be 35% lower . ) <p> Alan Manning , an economist at the London School of Economics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the US are caused by technological unemployment . While he agrees US data shows rising productivity and stagnating employment , it is n't the case in Britain . For about a decade UK productivity has been stagnating while employment , if anything , is up . If technology was having a big effect , he argues , it might show up in US data a bit earlier but would n't be entirely absent elsewhere . <p> "" They are citing a pattern that is n't true of many other of the most advanced economies , "" he says . "" Which makes me think other stuff is going on here . "" The UK 's situation suggests that there has not been too much investment in machines , but too little . <p> All the talk of robots taking jobs makes Gavin Kelly at the Resolution Foundation , a UK-based thinktank focused on improving the living standards of low- to middle-income earners , fret for different reasons . He is optimistic that technology will not end work and is also confident that we are capable of adapting to the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as technology churns things up . What he worries about is that all the rhetoric about robots might spook politicians into not pushing for better wages . <p> Others note the technology still has a long way to go . Might Google 's showy self-driving car lead people to extrapolate a little too far ? There are many tasks we do effortlessly that we do n't explicitly understand , yet those "" rules "" are exactly what is necessary for them to be computerised , notes Autor . There will still be plenty of room for humans , with common sense and judgment , to complement the work of machines , he believes . <p> Rodney Brooks , founder of Rethink Robotics which makes Baxter , dreams of the day when we will truly have robots with arms that can manipulate stuff . We need them to do all the unskilled jobs no one wants , including providing care for our ageing population , he says . But the technological challenge of making robots dexterous is "" massive "" ( something that does n't afflict the self-driving car ) . "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to do , "" he says . He cites a problem he calls the "" bin of parts "" . While a person can reach in to a bin full of jumbled parts and grab the right one , a robot still ca n't . <p> In 2010 researchers at the University of California , Berkeley , programmed a robot to fold a pile of towels ( videos of it went viral ) . But it took the robot , which cost $400,000 to buy , 25 minutes a towel , with most time spent working out how to grasp it . The researchers have been working on trying to get it to do a full cycle of laundry , but many areas seem to hamper it . <p> If you still do n't feel reassured , Brynjolfsson , McAfee and Ford offer suggestions about how to avoid being usurped by a robot or lines of code . Just as a bad outcome is n't impossible , neither is it inevitable . <p> Individuals should cultivate skills , such as idea generation , where humans currently have the comparative advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the head-to-head race against machines . <p> Recommendations for policymakers include boosting entrepreneurs to enable them to invent the new industries and jobs necessary to replace the old ones and refocusing education to emphasise creativity and interpersonal skills . <p> They all float the idea of basic guaranteed incomes for everyone , or tax credits to supplement low-wage workers . <p> "" We are going to have to restructure our economy and society to deal with this , "" says Ford . If we did , he adds , we could live in a world where we all have a lot more leisure time . If all else fails , in the words of one prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist , Steve Jurvetson : "" We 'll probably make good pets . """
"<p> In early March , M Health Fairview , one of the largest health systems in Minnesota , got an urgent message from one of its vendors : Mountain View , California-based artificial intelligence startup Qventus . The 13-hospital system had contracted the company to help streamline its operations , but Qventus CEO Mudit Garg saw a more pressing need ahead . "" I will never forget this , "" says Dr. Karyn Baum , vice president of system clinical operations , recalling the email she received from Garg . "" It basically said , ' We 're worried about Covid . And we really think we might be able to help you . Do you want to talk ? "" <p> With the U.S. Covid-19 case count still low but rising fast , Garg knew his company was about to face the ultimate test . "" We started doing some early computations and realized that we 're going to need to react very differently than our traditional health systems are set up operationally , "" says Garg . "" This will require us to act and adapt really fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same day Minnesota health officials announced the state 's first positive coronavirus case , a team of employees from Qventus and M Health Fairview got to work building what would become the platform 's Covid-19 critical resource mission control . This gave Qventus customers real-time updates on managing Covid-19 patients , especially concerning the availability of ventilators , intensive care and other open beds , and negative airflow isolation rooms , which are critical to treating coronavirus patients . That initial team included Garg , 36 , and his cofounder and CTO Ian Christopher , 31 , who rolled up their sleeves to help their company move as quickly as possible . The first version of M Health Fairview 's Covid-19 mission control setup was live within 72 hours , with a more refined version operational in under 10 days . <p> It may seem odd that hospitals do n't already have this type of granular operations data , but it 's rare to worry about how to handle a sudden surge of patients who may require intensive care . At least , it was rare until Covid-19 hit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went from zero to 60 overnight , "" says Baum . <p> But Qventus was prepared with technology that could help aid the frontlines . The company has built a platform to help hospitals tap into real-time patient dataflows , predict operational bottlenecks and recommend remedies . Now it 's paying off . Qventus expects revenue to hit $18 million this year , a 50% increase from 2019 . And it 's not just because of the pandemic . Lost revenue from cancelled elective surgeries means many hospitals are going to be operating on tighter margins and trying to boost efficiency and cut waste . And making healthcare systems more efficient is what Qventus does best . <p> Screenshot of Covid-19 mission control for M Health Fairview . <p> qventus <p> Garg believes health systems , much like the patients they treat , need preventive care . So his company 's software helps clinicians adopt habits that make their organizations run more smoothly , using data and behavioral science . It does this by analyzing real-time patient data from electronic health records and overlaying this on top of the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a push alert on a phone , suggesting actions to help clinical support staff efficiently manage care . For example , say a patient is ready to be discharged but a very busy clinician is making the rounds and has n't seen the papers come through . A nudge will help them prioritize the discharge and free up another bed . Qventus ' analytic and predictive capabilities not only provides nudges on the patient level , but also on a hospital or even system level , enabling administrators to make more informed decisions about operations . <p> It seems like a no-brainer that hospitals should have systems in place that give them an overview of everything going on . But it 's a challenging problem , especially for bigger health systems that have grown over the years through mergers and acquisitions . Different hospitals within the same system might be using a multitude of different legacy technologies , which make it tough to share data . "" The problem is n't lack of information , "" says Baum . "" It 's a lack of synthesized information that 's put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "" <p> Qventus ' goal is n't to replace decision making by doctors , nurses or administrators , but rather to help them cut through the noise by providing a clearer picture of patient and hospital needs with help from artificial intelligence . This is precisely the reason Ursheet Parikh , a partner at Mayfield , invested in Qventus . "" When you use AI to make a person into a superhero , they become your champion , they buy your product , they adopt it into the organization , "" says Parikh . "" Your product does n't have to be better than a person , it just has to make somebody better . "" Another of the company 's selling points , Parikh says , is the geographic breadth of its customers . "" I always feel you can sell anything in the bubbles of New York and San Francisco , "" says Parikh . "" We saw they had customers in Arkansas and Oklahoma . "" <p> One thing that the current pandemic has demonstrated is that the company 's technology "" enables hospitals to care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parikh . This is becoming even more critical as hospitals go from facing cyclical challenges like the flu to unpredictable threats like Covid-19 . Qventus has raised $43 million to date from investors , including Mayfield , Bessemer Venture Partners , Northwest Venture Partners and New York-Presbyterian Hospital . <p> "" Think of it as preventative maintenance for an operational process in a hospital , like things you would do for a machine in a factory , "" says Qventus CEO Mudit Garg . <p> The original idea for the company was born out of Garg 's experience as a McKinsey consultant , when he was first exposed to the U.S. healthcare system . Garg , who had grown up in India , was shocked by the general disorder and extremely long waits in hospital emergency departments despite their world-class clinicians , therapies and equipment . "" People were working as hard as they could and trying to do everything they could to take care of basic things and everything was happening by chance , not systematically , "" he says . <p> An engineer by training and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there had to be a better way of giving hospitals visibility into operational problems that were clogging up the wards and frustrating providers and patients alike . In 2011 , he teamed up with fellow student Ian Christopher , who was getting a master 's in engineering , to build the first prototype . With the addition of another Stanford engineering and MBA grad , Brent Newhouse , the trio cofounded analyticsMD , which was later rebranded as Qventus . The name is a combination of "" Q "" the physics symbol for electric charge and "" ventus "" the Latin word for wind . Garg and Christopher still run the day-to-day operations of the company , while Newhouse serves on the board . <p> Since 2011 , Qventus has grown to 80 employees , and has continued to scale its operations and increase its customer base . Its software has been deployed to 40 new locations this year . Aside from developing bespoke Covid-19 mission control for its customers , Qventus engineers also developed a free Covid-19 scenario planner based on 450 epidemiological models to help city , state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to various personal protective equipment . More than 1,1000 organizations have used it so far . <p> The experiences of hospitals in dealing with the first wave of the pandemic have led them to realize that they ca n't afford to shut down all other services in the event of a resurgence or future disaster . "" Think of it as preventative maintenance for an operational process in a hospital , like things you would do for a machine in a factory , "" says Garg . Keeping hospitals running efficiently during unpredictable events has now become a key use case for Qventus , enabling its customers to both care for their patients and keep the lights on .

"<h> Search <p> But its link with MasterCard would be its boon in the field , analysts said . <p> Grab previously announced that it will partner with MasterCard to issue prepaid cards to its users , with a limited roll-out in Singapore and the Philippines beginning in 2019 . According to Fitch Solutions , this highlights Grab 's desire to solidify its presence as the dominant mobile financial services ( MFS ) player in the Southeast Asian region . <p> Surely , this foray into financial services will be met with intense competition . AirAsia 's BigPay provides a similar prepaid card offering , for instance . "" We believe Grab has a far larger formalised customer base compared to the low-cost airline which will enable it to boost adoption , "" Fitch Solutions said . <p> Tencent and Alibaba are also continuous threats . However , Fitch Solutions argued Mastercard 's global acceptance will be a boon to Grab . <p> "" We expect Grab to continue its strategy of rolling-out QR codes for smaller merchants that do not accept cards . It will also intensify its strategy of partnering with banks and other start-ups to boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded . <p> "" Widespread adoption of its GrabPay platform will also enable it to increase use of its various services and allow for more effective monetisation , "" the firm said . Grab will be able to increase utilisation of its services and its GrabPay platform via the issuance of the prepaid cards . <p> The defining feature is that users will be able to top-up the cards at any retail outlet that currently accepts GrabPay , and also via passing cash to drivers of Grab 's ride-hailing service . "" We believe Grab will link the prepaid card virtually to GrabPay and incentivise users to pay for services with the card by awarding loyalty points for each transaction , "" Fitch Solutions said . <p> The current iteration of GrabPay already awards loyalty points which can be exchanged for discounts on ride hailing and for retail , and this has motivated its strong uptake , although deposits are currently only accepted via debit/credit card , AliPay , and PayPal . <p> "" Getting more users to transact digitally rather in cash will also be positive for Grab as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . The firm noted that in line with the launch of its delivery service and the focus on its food and grocery delivery , transacting digitally will mitigate the risk of non-payment for its services , which will also reduce the cost for Grab to handle cash related disputes . <p> This will allow Grab to monetise its virtual services , such as the artificial intelligence ( AI ) assisted online medical consultations it is preparing to offer with Chinese healthcare services platform Ping An Good Doctor . <p> As the penetration of financial services in Southeast Asia is relatively low , Fitch Solutions argued that the partnership could also boost this figure . The MasterCard-issued prepaid cards will enable its users to shop online or at any of the 3 million retail points which accept MasterCard , as well as enable overseas withdrawals of cash . <p> "" This will provide a further boost to e-commerce sales in the SEA region , which we currently forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 14.2% from 2018 to 2022 to reach US$54.8b , "" Fitch Solutions added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Contact us anonymously through this link ."
"<p> We will require fresh thinking to control the skies of the future . Gaining and maintaining air superiority in 2030 will require new concepts of operation . It will require a rejection of platform-based thinking that yearns for a "" silver bullet "" solution . And it will require airmen and joint leaders able to apply operational art across domains . While these intellectual foundations are certainly the most critical aspects of success in 2030 , it is also true that concepts of operation dependent on outdated technology will fail . Any family of capabilities able to solve the 2030 problem will ultimately be comprised of platforms across all domains and from all services . If airmen and joint leaders in 2030 lack key capabilities , it will not matter how skilled they are in warfighting or operational art . The most brilliant commander today , equipped only with the technologies of yesterday , is doomed to fail in combat . <p> With that in mind , this final installment of this series expands on previous discussions regarding the key attributes of the air superiority 2030 family of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team made with respect to force development and acquisition methodologies . <p> One of the attributes discussed in the last installment of this series was autonomy . The ECCT saw several uses for autonomous systems in assisting with data and network management . Many readers likely noted that I did not discuss autonomy more broadly , nor did I discuss whether or not our team foresaw future platforms in our air superiority force structure being manned or unmanned . The reason for this is relatively simple : Whether something is manned or unmanned does not provide capability in and of itself . Sometimes it makes sense to have a human present , sometimes it does not . In short , we were agnostic on the topic . If having a human onboard a particular platform makes it more effective , it should have a human on board . If humans limit the capability of a platform , they should be engineered out . Detailed analysis prior to and during the development of each particular capability within the air superiority family should determine the answer to the manned versus unmanned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topic are worth discussing in slightly more detail to inform future assessments . <p> War is fought in an environment beset by fog and friction . Because war is a contest of wills , a fighting force will do everything possible to impose more fog and friction on its enemies . For millennia , military forces have attacked adversary command and control networks to do just that . In ancient times , that command and control network consisted of military messengers either on foot or horseback . Later , Genghis Khan 's homing pigeons passed information and orders across his empire . Later still , the complex ciphers and codebreaking of World War II would play a decisive role . <p> What does this have to do with manned versus unmanned flight ? We can be sure that adversaries will attempt to degrade or deny our communication networks , whether the network that we pass information on or the network through which we exert command and control . In the context of platforms used for air superiority , the types and resiliency of the networks we use varies significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground station similar to an MQ-1 or MQ-9 ) , or autonomous systems . Remotely manned systems present the biggest challenges , as they require a high bandwidth of secure and reliable global communications . This is likely an untenable option for fighting in highly contested space . Even an agile , smart , and self-healing network can not maintain bandwidth and throughput in the face of raw jamming power projected over short distances . <p> Counterintuitively , autonomous and manned platforms are similar in their bandwidth requirements . This makes sense when one considers that a manned platform is also autonomous , at least from the network 's perspective . The commander must order it to do its mission , but once so ordered , the autonomous brains on the platform -- whether artificial or human -- execute the mission on their own without the need for an elaborate or robust communication network reaching back to a ground station . This simplifies the problem of determining whether and where a human should be in the loop . The key question becomes : Where does it make sense to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mission chain are we confident artificial intelligence or algorithms will allow the machine to do more effectively or efficiently what humans have done in the past ? <p> While this may seem a new question , it is n't . For decades , fighter aviation has been constantly adjusting the point of autonomy . As the fighter community moved from guns to missiles as the primary air-to-air weapon , what it really did was assign part of the mission chain ( targeting and killing , in this case ) to an autonomous ( albeit kamikaze ) wingman . Early on missiles were short range , but today medium- and long-range missiles fly autonomously well beyond visual range . Moving the point of autonomy using concepts such as an arsenal plane , a longer-range air-to-air weapon , or an unmanned "" loyal wingman "" merely extends the logic fighter aviation has used since the advent of the missile age . Does an autonomous option for a platform or weapon fill a gap and provide capability ? That should be the first question . And if the answer is yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what is the technical readiness ? This is all part of detailed tradespace analysis conducted when planning for development of any complex weapons system . <p> Survivability is the second key attribute that must be evaluated as part of any capability development effort . For nearly three decades , from the earliest days of the F-117 over Iraq to the most recent employment of F-22s over Syria , stealth provided the U.S. Air Force a distinct operational advantage . As a result , many have come to regard survivability as synonymous with stealth . Others have argued that stealth is an outdated technology the Air Force should abandon . Neither perspective is correct ; the truth lies somewhere in between . <p> Stealth is not dead , but it is also not the only attribute that contributes to the survivability of Air Force weapons and platforms . Survivability should be the true focus of analysis and discussion . This is a complex discussion , as aircraft signature , redundancy of onboard systems , speed , maneuverability , and electronic attack capability all interact to contribute to survivability . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these depends on a host of factors , not least of which is the state of all the relevant technologies . Take the F-117 Nighthawk , for example . While the United States had made the critical breakthrough in technology needed to create a stealth fighter , the state of the technology was such that it was incompatible with supersonic speeds or high maneuverability . Thus , engineers focused their efforts on optimizing the F-117 's signature . It survived by being unseen , not by being faster or nimbler . Though the F-117 was nearly invisible to radar , it was restricted to flying only at night to avoid another key sensor in aerial combat -- the human eye . Flying during the day could have resulted in the F-117 being seen by an enemy fighter pilot . Had that happened , it would have been nearly impossible for the Nighthawk to survive . <p> Fast forward 20 years to the early 2000s , and the F-22 Raptor found a different balance of attributes to maximize survivability . While stealthy , the F-22 is also fast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air defenses resulted in a radically new design . Combining "" supercruise "" capability with high-maneuverability , the F-22 can fight and survive in places the F-117 could not . <p> One other attribute affects survivability : lethality . To paraphrase the tactics manual I read as a young F-16 pilot , the best way to ensure you survive is to make sure the enemy does not . This remains true today , and it complicates any discussion of the trades one must make when designing an aircraft . The depth of a magazine , the quality of sensors that allow more accurate targeting , and the effectiveness of weapons ( kinetic or non-kinetic ) all impact survivability . But one can not have everything . Increase the magazine too much and the platform becomes too large to maneuver . Add too many sensors and the signature of the aircraft might be compromised . Optimizing this tradespace across the entire air superiority family of capabilities will require detailed analysis of all of these attributes . <p> First , using the terminology of sixth generation risks getting into a discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrage of questions that follow usually includes : Is it hypersonic ? How stealthy is it ? Does it carry directed energy weapons ? How high can it fly ? Is it manned ? These are all good things to know , but not in the context of defining sixth generation . When it started the Advanced Tactical Fighter ( ATF ) program in the 1980s , the Air Force did not set out to create a fifth-generation capability . Rather , it set out to create an aircraft that could operate in the expected operational environment of the early 2000s . Only after building the Raptor and seeing the tremendous advantage it provided did the Air Force conceive of it as a generational leap from F-15s and F-16s . Then , using the fifth-generation F-22 as a baseline , we began retroactively to classify older fighters using this new construct . Consequently , as a young F-16 pilot I was unaware that I was flying a fourth-generation platform . We only defined the F-16 ( and F-15 ) as such after the Air Force adopted the fifth-generation paradigm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided in the discussion of PCA was "" fighter . "" While to some this is sacrilege , the rationale is sound . When we hear the word "" car , "" most people envision a four-wheeled enclosed vehicle , typically propelled by an internal combustion engine with a range of 200 to 400 miles and top speeds of around 120 to 150 miles per hour . We all possess mental models that define a car in that way . The same is true of "" fighter . "" In the modern context , most people have a mental model of a short-range , highly maneuverable , supersonic , manned aircraft , typically armed with a limited number of missiles and a gun . A future PCA may not fit this model . Part III of this series highlighted the importance of increased range . Payload is also important , as increasing magazine depth allows for greater persistence and improved lethality . Maneuverability and speed will be important , too , but may not fit our traditional definition of a fighter , either . In the end , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an F-designation . But we need to be willing to challenge our assumptions and expand our thinking about how we balance the tradespace of any platform in the air superiority family of capabilities . <p> While the PCA has garnered much of the focus in the wake of the release of the Air Superiority 2030 Flight Plan , it is only one part of the solution to the air superiority problem of 2030 . Several other air , space , and cyberspace capabilities will be critical to control of the air . As mentioned previously , the front end of the kill chain -- the ability to find , fix , and track -- was the most difficult part to achieve . While space and cyberspace capabilities can not support this part of the kill chain on their own without air domain contributions , the inverse is also true . For instance , we have become accustomed to finding , fixing , and targeting ground forces by placing a remotely piloted aircraft overhead with full motion video . That will not be possible in highly contested 2030 threat environments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targets , but we will also use space- and cyberspace-derived information in near-real time to aid the targeting process . Using cyberspace to degrade an enemy command and control network or disrupt key enemy infrastructure may also be possible , though the nature of the cyberspace environment 15 years hence is extremely difficult to predict . <p> Future commanders will need to understand each domain and the capabilities it brings to the table as they make decisions to apportion their forces . How will the Air Force develop that future commander ? What set of education and experiences do future commanders need to succeed in the 2030 operational environment , and how can the Air Force provide these ? The answers to these questions could potentially affect tremendous change in professional military education , career paths , and leadership opportunities . We must start now to develop those airmen . The majors and lieutenant colonels of today are the senior general officers of 2030 , and they will need this knowledge and experience to effectively employ the multi-domain capabilities in the field by 2030 . <p> This leads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field by 2030 ? That is only 13 years away , after all . Under traditional acquisition approaches , most major defense programs take many more years to complete . Many others have noted some of the shortfalls with defense acquisition , and I will not repeat them here . Correcting these is an increasing area of focus for the Department of Defense , the services , and Congress . Often the reason citied is a need to be better custodians of taxpayer dollars , or to eliminate waste . While I personally appreciate that rationale as a taxpayer , as an airmen , I would add another . Namely , if the Department of Defense does not change its acquisition approach , our capability development will be outpaced by others around the world . We are already behind in many areas , and we must act now or our remaining technological advantages will continue to erode . Thus , to the fiscal imperative we must add an operational imperative : We must improve our ability to develop and field capability in the information age or we will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase the speed of capability development . First , requirements discipline -- the ability to know the basics of what you need and stick to those basics . Overly complex requirements or changing requirements create instability and start a cycle of delays and cost increases nearly impossible to break . The initial change in requirements drives an increase to development and delivery timelines , as additional engineering and testing must now be built into the program . That change to delivery timelines pushes the fielding of a capability to the right . As that timeline extends , the projected threat environment changes , incentivizing additional requirements changes to meet the evolving threat . And the cycle repeats itself . <p> Second , the Air Force should reinvigorate the concept of parallel development . This centers on the idea that there are various technological development cycles that are not naturally synchronized . There are industrial development cycles for components such as aircraft outer mold lines , spacelift , and engines . These items sometimes take a decade to advance . There are also hardware development cycles , which generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other apertures are on this typically two to five-year cycle . Finally , there are software development cycles that run in minutes or months . The idea behind parallel development is to mature each of the component of a spacecraft , aircraft , or cyberspace tool under development in a separate line of development and outside a formal program . Once a technology reaches the appropriate level of maturity , it then can be ported out of that parallel line of development and integrated into a program . Meanwhile , the tech development line continues working the next iteration of capability to ready it for future use . <p> Third , the Air Force should manage integration risk . Again , this is not a trivial task on a complex weapons system . However , prototyping and experimentation provide an elegant solution . The F-117 did this correctly by building an essentially fieldable prototype before entering its limited production run . More recently , the F-22 program began with a flyoff between the YF-22 and YF-23 prototypes . In truth , these aircraft were mere technology demonstrators rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the F-35 program . They did not contain all of the systems and sub-systems the final versions of their planes would need . For prototyping to truly work , we must move beyond the technology demonstrators these program used , and instead truly integrate the subsystems onto the capability we are trying to field . Only then can we evaluate whether or not it does what we need it to do . <p> Once that evaluation of the prototype is complete , it is time to decide whether to declare a program and invest in the long-lead items needed for production . In the event a production decision is made , program managers must hold fast to stable requirements . Parallel lines of technology development will have progressed , tempting operators and developers to adjust requirements . Do not succumb to this temptation . Maintain requirements stability and instead include newly developed technologies in later increments or blocks . Importing these into the baseline aircraft post-prototyping will only delay and derail the fielding of capability . If , on the other hand , you decide that the prototype @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production , apply the learning from prototyping to the next iteration of development . <p> Even in the first case , when a decision is made to enter production on the first prototype , continued technology development and planning for follow-on increments and blocks must continue . This was the ECCT 's fourth recommendation : take an incremental approach to capability development . As technologies mature through parallel development , so should several different prototyping phases . These will likely result in multiple blocks or increments of capability within a single program . As new blocks or increments enter to forces , older ones must be repurposed or retired . As the pace of technological change increases , we should expect the pace of the change in our force structure to increase as well . Keeping capabilities of any kind in military inventories for decades invites irrelevance . Sustaining old capabilities also ties up significant resources as operating costs increase over time . We must develop , test , field , and retire capabilities on a much faster cycle than in the last several decades . We must invest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar pace of technological change to what we are experiencing today occurred in the 1950s and 1960s , leading to the fielding of the "" century series "" of fighter aircraft . During this time period , the pace of change was not driven by Moore 's law , but rather by Bernoulli 's . Aerodynamic engineers applying the Swiss mathematician 's equations were rapidly learning how to build more effective and efficient airfoils , allowing them to build aircraft capable of greater speed , range , and maneuverability . The rapid pace of advancement required the constant fielding of new aircraft to keep pace with technology . Every five to seven years , we fielded new platforms that could fly higher , faster , and further . <p> Development of a PCA aircraft and other air domain capabilities needs to adopt this mindset lest we continue to fall behind . But this is not just an air domain issue . Maintaining relevance in cyberspace certainly will require rapid fielding in response to technological change . Furthermore , as the ability to launch cubesat and nanosat capabilities matures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentality in the fielding of space capabilities , as well . We can not accept using industrial-age acquisition timelines in an information-age world . <p> As I noted in my opening article in this series , building the force to achieve air superiority in 2030 will take time , effort , and sustained commitment . Even though technology and platform development are not a panacea , a focus on the fundamentals of capability development , maintaining requirements discipline , and using an acquisition game plan that leverages experimentation and prototyping are prerequisites to success . Pairing these acquisition and development techniques with new concepts of operation and developing of airmen and joint leaders with the ability to leverage the strengths across all the domains will get us there . <p> As I said at the outset , air superiority is not an optional capability . Without it , we will lose . <p> Alex Grynkewich is a Brigadier General in the U.S. Air Force and an F-16 and F-22 fighter pilot .

"<h> Skills hack : Keboola explains why it turned to hackathons to tackle a lack of talent and encourage diversity <p> Data is an area that needs a quick up-skill in many markets but for Keboola , rather than waiting for the market to sort itself out , it set about creating a series of events and hackathons to solve the problem faster . <p> The #DataDriven hackathon and #DataGirls take place in Singapore every few months and , while they both take aim at different problems , the investment from Keboola is to on one key objective : data skills . <p> Speaking to The Drum during the latest set of events in Singapore , Pavel Bulowski , co-founder of DataDriven and partner at Keboola , explains why a data business turned its hand to events . <p> "" There are two types of events of events we focus on to fulfill the key objective . One is to create a platform for the professional community ( data science , analytics , business intelligence ) . Rather than the sporadic meetups , we want to give these people opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gain new skills at hands on events like the hackathons . <p> The other track , #DataGirls , aims at a problem we have been hearing about for ages , the lack of talent in the market place . We focus on diversity in tech generally and we provide workshops that aim at demystifying the data analytics world to women , since given the current ratios of women in tech , we are talking about an almost exclusively boys club and that , in effect , shrinks the possible addressable talent market to 50% . The goal of these workshops is not to produce a data analyst in one day , that 's clearly impossible , but it is to break down the entrance barriers and to inspire and entice them to take more steps on this path on their own , "" he explains . <p> According to Bulowski , the idea for the events came from the fact that they had wished such platforms existed when they were starting out in the business , as well as it coming from a place of wanting to give back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it also helps Keboola too , in that is grows the understanding of data , and the company as a result . <p> "" Personally , I have been selling enterprise software and solutions for nearly a decade and when we launched Keboola in Singapore , we knew that many B2B IT companies marketing efforts were somewhere on the scale of clumsy to clueless , and mostly focus on individual networking . I believe that building the community is networking 2.0 and if you build relationships and have a good product or services , business will follow on its own . "" <p> Big brands are involved in the process , which Bulowski says helps expose them to some slightly ' out of the box ' uses of their data . <p> "" A good example is the first run of the #Datadriven hackathon here in Singapore , we convinced Skyscanner and Propertyguru to provide us with some proprietary data sets and , in exchange , they got two days of concentrated attention from over 100 of the brightest minds . Naturally this type of ' out of the box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions and hypotheses that might be hard to come up with internally at these companies , who are caught in the ' daily grind ' , "" he explains . <p> As for #DataGirls , Bulowski says the need to separate the events is to create an environment that feels more inclusive ( an approach shared by many in the industry ) and that , while it is a girls-only approach for now , the point is that it 's helping to push towards a more balanced path . <p> "" Talent is rare and hiring in this field is hard . Everyone is crying about this and yet , given how male-dominant this industry is , nearly 50% of people in the potential market is not addressed because it is hard to enter . Not that women need any special way of learning , the point is that we create a more inclusive environment where they feel more comfortable . Personally , I believe women make for fantastic data analysts as they often add valuable new point of views to the subject , I see this every day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bulowski , many brands are waving a diversity flag but "" rarely are they walking the walk "" , though #DataGirls is seeing support from tech business , such as Facebook , YellowFin , TAL and Google . <p> Yet , eventually Bulowski hopes that the need for ' exclusive clubs ' will diminish as the diversity issues balances . "" I am big believer in local communities , I like what groups like Coding Girls are doing . On the other hand , generally I think it 's ultimately about general inclusivity and while I recognize that these ' women-only ' groups are important for the awareness and education , they are in a sense another extreme in terms of being yet another ' exclusive club ' . But I believe that we are on the path to more balance .

"<h> University of the Witwatersrand : Impacting lives and creating careers through big data <p> In its simplest terms , data is defined as facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis . But in the midst of the digital age , the way we collect and generate data is constantly evolving , largely due to the introduction of multi- and social media . These days , data is produced by everything around us , resulting in the collection of large amounts of information , structured and unstructured , that is now more commonly recognised under the name of ' Big Data ' . <p> And in the era of the Internet , big data is extremely important to businesses and organisations in virtually every sector as it 's used as a source for ongoing discovery and analysis . Whether your field may be healthcare , communications , bandwidth or something more complex -- like the mind-boggling content surrounding quantum physics -- the use of big data in these industries allows people to make faster and more intelligent decisions . <p> The University of the Witwatersrand ( Wits ) , an institution **26;1061;TOOLONG for its high academic standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is doing all it can to help us unravel the secrets of Big Data . In fact , the leading South African research institution has conducted several projects with the purpose of better informing the local and global community . <p> Image courtesy of the University of the Witwatersrand <p> Wits ' work on delivering sufficient bandwidth to meet growing big data demand is an example of how university research can greatly benefit the people . Questioning how the rise of big data and the advancement of information technology has led to serious implications in terms of delivering sufficient bandwidth supply , the qualified researchers from Wits set out to find a solution . <p> To solve the issue , scientists from Wits and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research ( CSIR ) sought alternatives with the capacity to take over where traditional optical communications systems will soon be likely to fail . Modern optical communication systems currently stick to one pattern , largely due to technical hurdles when it comes to adding and extracting information . Through hard work and dedication , researchers at Wits demonstrated that over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can potentially increase the bandwidth of communication systems by 100 times . <p> But that 's not all that Wits researchers have uncovered , as the institution also explores how to increase the security of our communication systems . Current communication systems are considered fast but not secure . In order to protect them , researchers rely on the laws of nature when it comes to encoding , exploiting quirky properties attached to the quantum world -- much like the use of Quantum Key Distribution ( QKD ) for secure communication . <p> Through its powerful research , the institution now boasts exciting implications for fast and secure data transfer in the future , allowing them to aid technological advances around the world , and helping them establish secure quantum communication links over long distances . <p> "" To ensure that data is used to inform public health policy and practice for the benefit of the people in Africa , we need to prioritise training of African postgraduate biostatisticians who can provide the required analysis to a high standard , "" he adds . The Professor , who heads the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African researchers to receive funding from the Wellcome Trust and the UK 's Department for International Development . <p> With these additional funds , the University , with the help of other influential institutions , will be able to develop a network of biostatisticians who will deliver statistical courses for biomedical researchers , develop and implement statistical theory to analyse health data , and create framework for improved biostatistical skill among health researchers and academics in nine African countries . <p> "" Wits saw an opportunity to merge two disciplines and develop new teaching programmes at the honours level , "" says Professor Ebrahim Momoniat . "" This allows us to be at the forefront in South Africa with respect to the future of teaching high level computational expertise combined with advanced mathematics and statistics . "" <p> Aimed at postgraduate computer science students , this course focuses on strong computational and mathematical foundations that are embedded in practical application . You 'll learn every facet of the big data analytics pipeline , from technology deployment , to machine learning , optimisation and multivariate statistics . The degree consists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to big data analytics , as well as two electives for students to specialise in later on . <p> Students of this course are also required to complete a hands-on research project focusing on a real-world or industry-based problem regarding big data analytics . This project will teach students all aspects of research design methodology -- from proposal and literature review , to implementation and results evaluation . <p> Through this comprehensive degree programme , you 'll acquire skills that will prove incredibly beneficial to your career , regardless of whether it 's in academia or any other industry . You 'll learn how to research , to think critically , to write , communicate and present effectively , and to collate and analyse large amounts of data , just to name a few . <p> So , if you 're searching for an institution that provides a unique skill set alongside a comprehensive degree and outstanding research opportunities , you 'll find the University of the Witwatersrand goes above and beyond to ensure graduates stand out from the crowd in Big Data Analytics."

"<h> Wake up : The time for sustainability in the luxury industry is now <p> November 11 hosts one of the largest retail events in the world -- 11.11 also known as Singles ' Day . A total of over $38 billion was made through online discount sales -- with 331 million packages being delivered by various postal and courier businesses . In 2017 , Alibaba made a whopping $25 billion in purchases -- a 40% increase from the 2016 sales , totally crushing the total sales of Black Friday and Cyber Monday . This is great news for Alibaba and it 's clear that the Chinese consumer base has grown majorly but there was a downside to this massive moment . An estimated 160,000 tons of packaging waste came about as a result of the sales and deliveries that occurred on China 's Singles ' Day . Alibaba along with a number of other e-commerce companies have claimed to use environmentally friendly practices to alleviate the negative impact they have on the earth . Unfortunately , according to experts , these biodegradable products are only able to biodegrade under certain circumstances . Meaning many of these packages will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste problem . <p> In 1950 , the world population was 4.5 billion people . 67 years later , in 2017 , the population stands at close to 8 billion people . Who would have thought that the Earth would be inhabited by so many people ? With the population increase came major advancements within the commercial markets , industrial field , and technology sector . One thing humans forgot to think about was the impact all our innovations would have on the environment . Climate change has become a blaring reality within the last couple of decades . But all hope is not lost . It is not too late for us to start taking action . I am optimistic about how we can preserve our world 's most valuable resources and I believe the fashion and luxury industry can play a major role in creating a sustainable earth . <p> The luxury market has always been a representation of power and sophistication . For centuries , luxury goods have been purchased and donned by royalty and the aristocrats of society . Many prestigious luxury brands that started off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the luxury market . <p> These brands went from being multi-million dollar revenue brands to being brands worth tens of billions of dollars due to commercialization and globalization . Louis Vuitton is a great example to observe . <p> In 1987 , a $4 billion merger took place between Louis Vuitton and M ? et-Hennessy . This move gave Louis Vuitton the opportunity to expand its investments in the luxury business . After the merger , the company became known as LVMH . LVMH focused on growing and expanding from the 1990 's and into the 2000 's . <p> In 2017 , LVMH was part of an acquisition that went down in history . A $13 billion dollar deal went through for the acquisition of major fashion and luxury brand Christian Dior . As of May 2017 , the Louis Vuitton brand is worth $28.8 billion and its products continue to be among the most coveted items in the world <p> According to a 2016 report from Bain &amp; Company , the market for personal luxury goods was an estimated $293 billion and it is projected to rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founder of McMaster Institute , said it best . "" Luxury brands are about legacy . "" <p> He admonished that we need to be aware of the potentially hazardous chemicals that we use to produce luxury products . These chemicals affect the land we use , the air we breathe , and our own personal health as well . It is clear that , that in the midst of globalization and expansion of the luxury market , attention needs to be given to the effect our actions are having on the planet . <p> This is the time for us to come together to come up with better and more affordable ways to create sustainability within the trading industry for all products -- fashion , luxury , and technology . <p> While the technological and financial advancements within the luxury industry may be what the world needs , we also need to pay attention to the environment . How are we treating the land we use ? What chemicals are we putting in our products ? Is expansion happening at the Earth 's expense ? These are questions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to advancements in the luxury industry , AI is what will take the luxury industry to the next level . LUXSENS is providing price transparency within the new and secondary luxury market in order to lead the luxury world in the direction of responsible consumption . This will make room for great innovation and convenience in the trading of luxury products -- both brand new and pre-owned . We have seen the way artificial intelligence has started to revolutionize the fashion and luxury industry . <p> When people think about sustainability they tend to only think about sourcing and utilizing eco-friendly materials . But that is only one part of the process of making sustainability a reality within the luxury industry . Sustainability starts from how we treat the environment ; it must be taken care of . The care of the animals , the care of the land , the chemicals used during production -- these are all things that need to be taken into consideration . Sustainability is about protecting the earth as a whole and the luxury market has a part to play in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pollution in the world -- after oil . It accounts for 10% of global carbon emissions . Changes need to be made within the way luxury items are produced . <p> The Kering Group is leading the way in creating a more sustainable future for the luxury industry and the earth as a whole . <p> "" In our strategy , we want to reduce the environmental footprint by 40% "" <p> At the Business of Fashion Summit , in Shanghai , Michael Beutler , Director of Sustainability Operation at the Kering Group , mentioned how half of this strategy is focused on bettering their current operations , while the other half is focused on incorporating more innovation . Some of these innovations have already been implemented in their modes of operation -- e.g. recycling textiles -- in order to make sustainability a reality . Artificial intelligence is gradually becoming a key contributor to making the world a better place . <p> The Earth 's survival depends on the actions we take today . Future generations are dependent on our efforts to make sustainability a global reality . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would not be having this conversation . But there is no point in dwelling on what should have happened . The best thing we can do is come together , creating a united force , to shifting the way we treat our land , our seas , and our air . We , as a collective within the luxury industry , must also come together to play our part in creating a more sustainable environment around us . Creating a better earth is a job for everyone , including you . You have a part you can play . We need your help and the Earth does too . The future is depending on it . <p> TechNode does not necessarily endorse the statements made in this article ."

"<h> One day of employment a week is all we need for mental health benefits -- study <p> As automation advances , predictions of a jobless future have some fearing unrest from mass unemployment , while others imagine a more contented work-free society . <p> Aside from economic factors , paid employment brings other benefits - often psychological - such as self-esteem and social inclusion . Now , researchers at the universities of Cambridge and Salford have set out to define a recommended "" dosage "" of work for optimal wellbeing . <p> They examined how changes in working hours were linked to mental health and life satisfaction in over 70,000 UK residents between 2009 and 2018* . <p> The study , published today in the journal Social Science and Medicine , shows that when people moved from unemployment or stay-at-home parenting into paid work of eight hours or less a week , their risk of mental health problems reduced by an average of 30% . <p> Yet researchers found no evidence that working any more than eight hours provided further boosts to wellbeing . The full-time standard of 37 to 40 hours was not significantly different to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As such , they suggest that to get the mental wellbeing benefits of paid work , the most "" effective dose "" is only around one day a week - as anything more makes little difference . <p> "" We have effective dosage guides for everything from Vitamin C to hours of sleep in order to help us feel better , but this is the first time the question has been asked of paid work , "" said study co-author Dr Brendan Burchell , a sociologist from Cambridge University who leads the Employment Dosage research project . <p> "" We know unemployment is often detrimental to people 's wellbeing , negatively affecting identity , status , time use , and sense of collective purpose . We now have some idea of just how much paid work is needed to get the psychosocial benefits of employment - and it 's not that much at all . "" <p> Supporting the unemployed in a future with limited work is the subject of much policy discussion e.g. universal basic income . However , researchers argue that employment should be retained across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be redistributed . <p> "" In the next few decades we could see artificial intelligence , big data and robotics replace much of the paid work currently done by humans , "" said Dr Daiga Kamerade , study first author from Salford University and Employment Dosage researcher . <p> "" If there is not enough for everybody who wants to work full-time , we will have to rethink current norms . This should include the redistribution of working hours , so everyone can get the mental health benefits of a job , even if that means we all work much shorter weeks . "" <p> "" Our findings are an important step in thinking what the minimum amount of paid work people might need in a future with little work to go round , "" she said . <p> The study used data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study to track the wellbeing of 71,113 individuals between the ages of 16 and 64 as they changed working hours over the nine-year period . People were asked about issues such as anxiety and sleep problems to gauge mental health . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased by around 30% with up to eight hours of paid work , although women did n't see a similar jump until working 20 hours . <p> They note that "" the significant difference in mental health and wellbeing is between those with paid work and those with none "" , and that the working week could be shortened considerably "" without a detrimental effect on the workers ' mental health and wellbeing "" . <p> The team offer creative policy options for moving into a future with limited work , including "" five-day weekends "" , working just a couple of hours a day , or increasing annual holiday from weeks to months - even having two months off for every month at work . <p> They also argue that working hour reduction and redistribution could improve work-life balance , increase productivity , and cut down CO2 emissions from commuting . However , they point out that reduction of hours would need to be for everyone , to avoid increasing socioeconomic inequalities . <p> "" The traditional model , in which everyone works around 40 hours a week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . Our research suggests that micro-jobs provide the same psychological benefits as full-time jobs , "" said co-author and Cambridge sociologist Senhu Wang . <p> "" However , the quality of work will always be crucial . Jobs where employees are disrespected or subject to insecure or zero-hours contracts do not provide the same benefits to wellbeing , nor are they likely to in the future . "" <p> Dr Burchell added : "" If the UK were to plough annual productivity gains into reduced working hours rather than pay rises , the normal working week could be four days within a decade .

"<p> I understand why the Ontario premier and all the mayors in the Greater Toronto Area want to lure Amazon to set up its second headquarters in Toronto : Amazon would make investments that would benefit our cities . I also get why , so soon after he was elected , Prime Minister Justin Trudeau went to Kitchener for the opening of the new Google building and why , earlier this year , he rushed to Montreal to welcome Facebook 's new artificial intelligence ( AI ) lab being established there . <p> On the surface , it looks like a story worth celebrating : American tech big shots think Canada 's got talent ! But here 's a spoiler alert : This story wo n't have a happy ending . In fact , we 're witnessing the second coming of the branch-plant economy . Instead of swooning when U.S. behemoths come courting , politicians should recognize that they are ensuring the demise of our homegrown tech sector -- a sector that is absolutely vital to our future prosperity . <p> Amazon , Google , Facebook , Microsoft or Apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why do they want to build in Canada ? The answer is simple : AI is going to change everything about the way we live and work and , thanks to decades of publicly-funded research , Canada is a global leader in AI . Funded by our tax dollars , our academic institutions have been quietly producing stellar computer science and engineering graduates , who have been going on to do groundbreaking research in AI . This is n't news to the American tech giants -- they have recruited heavily here for years . By building here , they will be even better positioned to secure the best talent . <p> Amazon , Google , Facebook , Microsoft or Apple can and do already tap us as consumers <p> Those new recruits , both while they are working in shiny new jobs here in Canada , and when they leave ( as the very best inevitably will ) to pursue a career path at the multi-nationals ' HQ in the United States , will create enormous intellectual capital and shareholder value -- for their U.S.-based employers . Which will create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffers -- in the U.S. <p> What do we get ? Bragging rights , mostly ; the same kind we get when a Canadian actor or singer makes it big in the U.S. But in the long term , Canada will reap only a small percentage of the economic value generated by our homegrown tech talent . It is yet another terrible trade where Canada winds up at the bottom of the value chain . <p> But there 's a particularly high multiplier effect with tech talent , because it has the potential to create so many jobs and so much wealth . The straight economic bleed from Canada to the United States that is underway in the tech community is already staggering , and it 's still early days . If we stay on this path , the best innovators and leaders -- the people we absolutely need if Canada is going to emerge a winner in the fourth industrial revolution -- will be shipped over the border like so many barrels of oil . We need to invest all our energy in figuring out how to keep them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the multinationals that want to poach them . <p> If we want to win globally , we have to compete <p> I 'm not a protectionist . I understand why U.S. tech giants come to Canada , and as an entrepreneur , tech-company founder and venture capitalist , I welcome them : I believe that all Canadian industries need an open , competitive market in order to spur innovation and technological advances . Rather , I am arguing for enlightened self-interest . If we want to win globally , we have to compete -- not field a farm team whose main purpose is to provide talent for the big leagues . We need to believe in ourselves enough to incentivize and invest in early-stage Canadian technology companies so they can scale up and rise to global dominance . <p> Here 's a radical idea : Recruit our best and brightest to our own growing multinationals ! Here 's another : Instead of throwing tax dollars at U.S.-based tech giants , our governments should revamp their procurement policies and start aggressively buying Canadian in order to give the best and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot at expansion , so they can compete with American giants . Most importantly , we need our venture capital industry and institutional investors to take meaningful stakes in Canadian start-ups , so we support Canadian ventures and encourage more Canadians to invest in them . When a Canadian-founded tech start-up is majority U.S.-owned -- as so many of ours are on a trajectory to be -- the lion 's share of economic value bleeds out of Canada , regardless of where the company is located . <p> The ancient Greeks used a Trojan horse to breach the walls of the city of Troy and destroy it . We need to recognize that the tech giants who are coming to Canada are using the same playbook . They are not our saviours -- this is a modern Trojan-horse attack on Canada 's future prosperity . <p> Anthony Lacavera is Founder and Chairman of Globalive and author of How We Can Win . <h> Almost Done ! <p> Postmedia wants to improve your reading experience as well as share the best deals and promotions from our advertisers with you .

"<h> 3 Lessons Other Insurers Should Learn from Ping An <p> Insurance companies have been slow to adapt to a digital-first approach . In an increasingly digital world , many insurers are put in a tough spot as they struggle to keep up with the demands of a new generation of consumers . <p> Taking advantage of the incumbents ' inability to meet these needs , we are seeing a surge of insurtech startups stepping in to seize the market . Fighting off these agile startups have proved to be difficult with the shackles of bureaucracy and legacy systems . <p> Ping An , however , is one of the few outliers in this scenario . <p> Source : Ping An <p> A relatively young player with just over three decades of experience , this insurer has managed to squeeze past all the incumbents to take the crown in the 2018 Forbes ' world largest insurers list and as of January 2018 , the company is worth US$ 217 billion . <p> This is quite a feat , as most companies who made it in the top 20 list typically have over a century of history and nearly half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track record , it is no surprise that Ping An is frequently featured as a poster boy of insurers successfully embracing the new digital world . Which incidentally , is something that we covered at great length in our Insurtech Tech 10 : Trends for 2019 report . <p> From our observation and extensive studies , here are 3 key lessons we believe insurers can learn from Ping An . <h> 1 . Looking beyond insurance , and developing an ecosystem <p> For Ping An , it 's not just about insurance , it 's about bringing in fringe services that gave them an advantage . In China , the new social+ business models have been impacting various industries from e-commerce all the way to insurance . Social+ brings a social element to connect users to businesses and strengthens their ecosystem play . <h> 2 . Embedding yourself in your customer 's journey <p> One way that Ping An is doing is by playing an active role in their customer 's well-being . Through Ping An 's Good Doctor the company able to create brand stickiness to over 54 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Source : Ping An <p> While being digital-first is crucial , being in the real world with your customers are equally important as well . Leveraging on AI-Powered unstaffed mobile clinics , Ping An is able to provide instant diagnosis or provide referrals to human doctors . <p> It is also equipped with an automated medicine medicine dispenser that will be stocked with over 100 types of common medicine . <h> 3 . Harnessing the power of data and AI <p> Data is king . <p> A statement that is as true as it is clich ? . To no one 's surprise data is a huge part of Ping An 's play . That play is once again supported by Ping An 's far-reaching ecosystem . <p> With over 265 Million users registered on Ping An Good Doctor , it serves as a huge pool of data that the Ping An can tap into for various commercial reasons -- from risks assessments to building better products . <p> Source : Ping An <p> Ping An 's deep focus into artificial intelligence also gave birth to their AI-powered medical imaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lung cancer . They further developed that technology to cover 35 different type of illnesses . <p> As a result of that Shanghai 's Ministry of Health signed an agreement with them to ensure that all hospitals in Shanghai must connect with them in real time . <h> Taking Inspiration from China <p> The time for insurers to reinvent themselves is long overdue , the world as we know it has been lifted from the ground beneath us . <p> Many would point to 6 years ago when Ping An shifted all the systems on the cloud as the beginning of their transformation journey that eventually lead to them being the most valuable insurance company in the world today . <p> It 's not too late for insurers to take a page out of Ping An 's playbook and start their own version of a transformation journey . <p> This article first appeared on our sister page Fintechnews.ch .

"<p> Major brands are walking away from Facebook , at least temporarily , because they say it is not doing enough to stop hate speech . <p> Credit : Illustration by Tam Nguyen/Ad Age <p> Beyond the politics and posturing , the flight of hundreds of brand media budgets from Facebook has created a learning opportunity . <p> Boycotting brands ( at least those actually spending meaningful money on Facebook before their announced "" exits "" ) will have at least a month to see how well they can live outside its $70 billion-plus annual media pool , which also includes Instagram , Messenger and the Facebook Audience Network on the broader web . Even competing brands can watch what their boycotting competitors do and how they fare . <p> One lesson is already emerging : Data suggest leaving Facebook behind does n't hurt nearly as much as some people might have feared . This may pose a bigger long-term risk to Facebook than the short-term revenue hit , which looks to be a measly single-digit percentage impact even with big advertisers like Unilever , Disney and Verizon pulling out . Facebook has 8 million customers , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they catch wind that big boycotters are n't hurting much , it could make them think twice too . <p> Here are some of the other things brands can -- and ca n't -- learn from the experience . <h> This is not an A/B test <p> First , what you ca n't learn is the precise impact leaving Facebook has on sales or other performance measures . No matter how clean a brand 's break with Facebook at the start of July , when the Stop Hate for Profit boycott began , evaluating results before and after does n't constitute a proper A/B test . GSK Europe Middle East and Africa Media Director Jerry Daykin pointed out some of the reasons for this on Twitter and LinkedIn in recent weeks . <p> For one thing , marketers would be comparing two months with slightly different seasonal characteristics . Alternately , trying to compare July 2020 results to July 2019 is complicated by a global pandemic that massively reshaped market demand and consumer behavior across categories . The boycott itself might have substantially changed other variables -- including bids for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would involve using different media plans in different regions of the same country at the same time , changing only one variable -- the media plan . <h> Leaving Facebook may not hurt much <p> Unilever 's Dollar Shave Club had been a regular spender on Facebook for years . But it went cold turkey midday on June 29 , two days after Unilever announced it would stop all advertising on Facebook platforms and Twitter in the U.S. for the balance of the year , citing the increasing polarization of the platforms . <p> Dollar Shave Club 's desktop site traffic was down 8.2 percent in the five days from June 30 to July 4 after it turned off Facebook platforms , according to SimilarWeb . But competitors Harry 's and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. ' s Gillette , which continued to advertise on Facebook platforms , saw their traffic decline faster than DSC 's during that period -- down 17.8 and 13.2 percent , respectively , SimilarWeb reported . <p> Wherever DSC redirected spending appeared to work about as well as its competitors . According to BrandTotal , DSC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the period , either . Nor did it ramp up TV , according to iSpot.tv . That leaves the rest of web and radio as likely outlets . The brand declined comment . <p> Over a longer period , leaving Facebook behind can work out just fine , too . A Fortune 50 giant that stopped Facebook advertising in early 2019 over brand safety and accountability issues saw growth of its consumer business accelerate to 5 percent last year from 3.6 percent in 2018 and its stock price rise almost 43 percent , ahead of industry peers . ( A company executive declined to acknowledge its move out of Facebook publicly or say where it had redirected spending , but its withdrawal from Facebook platforms was verified by Ad Age . ) One place the brand 's spending clearly did move was TV , which went from close to zero before its Facebook boycott to more than $80 million annually afterward , according to iSpot.tv data . <p> Analytics firm Marketing Evolution does n't have clients that have joined the Facebook boycott . But the firm did , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to analyze a recent nine-month brand-building campaign for a luxury auto brand . The analysis evaluated what the impact would have been from taking $1 million of Facebook spending out of the mix and reallocating it across other digital channels , including Twitter , digital display ads and search . The move reduced impact of the spending by 0.1 percent . <p> "" Facebook belonged in the optimized plan , but the brand would not suffer had the customer not had Facebook available , "" says John Matthews , Marketing Evolution president and chief customer officer . Twitter delivered more impact than Facebook on improving brand attitude , while display and search generated more web visits than Facebook , he says . <p> Some still put all their e-commerce money on Facebook , Tipograph says , because the platforms make it easy to buy ads at scale . "" But if you put all your money into one channel , you 're not doing it right , "" she says . "" My healthiest clients have a very diverse mix . Some of my clients use us in 29 platforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's this narrative within the industry that if you want to buy social media , you buy Facebook , and you checked that box . But over the last year , I 've seen our traffic really diversify . And what 's really interesting is that programmatic and direct buys from publishers have risen to the top "" in delivering sales and customer acquisition . <h> You must pay to really play <p> The Stop Hate for Profit coalition behind the Facebook boycott is n't asking brands to stop putting unpaid organic posts on its platforms , or even to stop sponsoring influencer posts there , since that money goes to creators , not the platform . <p> Some boycotters , including Birchbox , have redirected Facebook media spending to influencers , including on Instagram . <p> Unilever is n't part of the boycott , but besides halting ad spending on Facebook and Twitter , it also is n't sponsoring influencer posts there , a spokeswoman says . Yet the company is still posting for free on those platforms . <p> The problem is , the News Feed algorithms used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it relatively unlikely people will see posts that are n't backed by media spending -- not surprisingly , since they 're all in business to make money . <p> Even so , Unilever launched a nearly five-hour Facebook Live event on July 3 to mark National Crown Day -- the one-year anniversary of the signing of California 's Crown Act against hair style discrimination -- and Dove 's effort to pass similar laws elsewhere . <p> The livestream , hosted by actress Tai Beauchamp , featured live music and appearances from California 's Sen. Kamala Harris among others . <p> It got 40,000 livestream views across Facebook and YouTube , which a spokeswoman described as "" a huge success , "" though viewership was well short of the millions some prior Dove videos have attracted on Facebook when backed by paid ads . <p> The broader Dove Crown effort over the past month was backed by ads on BET , OWN and TV-One plus radio across 120 stations in 60 markets . <h> The cloak of invisibility has lifted <p> Years ago , a key feature of digital advertising was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitor impact of the Facebook boycott can do so easily today , though usually for a price . <p> Some information is even free . As part of its efforts around transparency , Facebook launched its Ad Library two years ago , letting anyone see what ads brands are currently running and on which of its platforms . That generally only indicates existence of an ad , when it ran , and possibly how many people saw it , but not how much was spent . And it does n't go beyond Facebook . <p> For a price , Pathmatics -- whose Facebook spending data has become ubiquitous in boycott media coverage -- tracks daily spending by brands across social and other digital platforms . <p> Another firm , BrandTotal , provides similar competitive analysis of brand targeting and strategies in social media . The firm examined spending on five social platforms -- Facebook , Instagram , Twitter , YouTube and Linked-In -- for boycotting brands from July 2-8 and found the boycotters scattering their social spending fairly widely . <p> CVS and MassMutual , for example , were spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Adidas , Starbucks , Dunkin , Honda and spirits brands Johnnie Walker , Crown Royal , Smirnoff and Captain Morgan put it all into YouTube . Target put 97 percent into Twitter , 3 percent into YouTube . Some boycotters , including Ford , Denny 's , Coca-Cola Brands , Lululemon and Sony , did n't spend anything at all on the five social platforms . And while Ford and Coke had said they 're suspending all social spending , the others did n't . Two brands that had n't announced boycotts -- Apple and Nike -- nonetheless were n't advertising on Facebook or Instagram . <p> Jack Neff , editor at large , covers household and personal-care marketers , Walmart and market research .

"<p> Doug Stephens is one of the world 's foremost retail industry futurists . This piece is an excerpt from his book Reegineering Retail : The Future of Selling in a Post-Digital World . <p> What does the future hold for retail employees ? Well , there 's just no way to put it gently . The days of the retail clerk are over . By clerk , I 'm referring to the millions of retail workers who operate checkouts , greet customers at the door , count inventory , look up prices , scan bar codes , corral shopping carts and do their best to remember snippets of product information about the vast assortments they carry . These jobs will all but disappear within 20 years , perhaps sooner . <p> Part of what 's driving this change is the quickly growing gap between customer service expectations and reality . A recent survey indicated that a full 48 per cent of shoppers today believe that they know more about the product they 're looking for than the sales associate helping them , and chances are they 're right . It 's never been easier to rapidly gather knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More startling , though , is that 67 per cent of those surveyed have doubts about whether the sales associate helping them is even telling the truth . I suspect this has less to do with consumer paranoia and more to do with living in a world where the correct answer to any question is two clicks away . We trust Google infinitely more than we trust salespeople . And so , in a world where partly right is as good as being wrong , the relative utility of retail salespeople is diminished . In fact , as research released by Google indicated , two-thirds of shoppers said they 've been unable to find the information they need in stores , resulting in almost half of them being left feeling frustrated . <p> Exacerbating the situation is the ongoing battle for higher wages by retail and hospitality workers . Few would defend the miserably low wages that retail has become notorious for paying . In other words , for at least 50 per cent of retail workers , supporting a family with a spouse and two children on a retail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , for example , the median wage for all retail workers in 2015 was US$11.01 per hour , or US$22,900 per year . In the same year , the poverty threshold for a U.S. family of four was set at US$24,339 . <p> You might expect such a low income to insulate retail workers from technological disruption , but it actually makes them much more vulnerable . Here 's why . While the federal minimum wage is currently stuck at US$7.25 per hour ( some states have minimums that sit slightly above that ) , labour groups have been fighting for a mandated US$15 per hour . Two U.S. states , New York and California , have already signed bills to move the minimum wage to US$15 and an additional nine U.S. cities have approved moves to a US$15 minimum , some already taking effect by 2017 . <p> The problem inherent in this increase is twofold . First , most economists agree that even a US$15-per-hour minimum wage falls short of what it really should be if wages were properly indexed to inflation . Therefore , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone in what will be ongoing pressure to raise minimums even further . And while raising wages is the morally correct thing to do , it does n't follow that there can possibly be a reciprocal increase in individual productivity to meet it . In other words , the nature and productivity of the work at US$9 per hour is likely to be no different than at $US15 . The difference will have to be accounted for in either lower corporate profits or higher consumer prices . Sure , we can argue the bigger ethical questions that surround corporate and consumer greed , but none of it solves the problem at hand . <p> Second , compounding the case against workers is the fact that an army of technologies stands at the ready to take over their work . For example , California-based Simbe Robotics recently introduced its Tally robot , the world 's first fully autonomous stock-keeping robot . Able to operate for between eight and twelve hours on a single charge , Tally robots patrol the aisles of grocery stores visually checking and recording up to twenty thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near-perfect accuracy . They then relay this information to store management for action or correction . The robots can detect even the subtlest shelving errors or out of stocks . According to Mirza Shah , Simbe 's chief technology officer , companies such as CVS or Walgreens would have to dedicate between twenty-five and forty staffing-hours per week to accomplish the same amount of work as Tally , but even then , humans would complete it with far less accuracy . <p> New England -- based robotics company Symbotic LLC makes robotic autonomous warehousing technology that can race through warehouse aisles and literally climb racking to put orders together in a fraction of the time it takes human workers . As a result , the technology can cut labour costs by up to 80 per cent and reduce the warehouse footprint by 25 to 40 per cent . Target is now using this technology in one of its largest distribution centres in California . <p> If you 're thinking that inventory and warehouse jobs are more suited to robotics but that the sales associate role requires the human touch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years of testing robots in its Orchard Supply Hardware store in San Jose , Calif. , the company recently announced that it would be introducing a "" fleet "" of robots in its San Francisco-area stores . The robots , called LoweBots , are programmed to greet customers at the door , respond in multiple languages , field product inquiries and direct customers to the items they 're looking for . In addition , store staff can access the LoweBots for up-to-the-minute information on pricing or inventory . Moreover , the robots are able to analyze data and detect patterns that might influence business decisions in real time . And all without ever taking a lunch break , a sick day or even a paycheck ! <p> Story continues below advertisement <p> Story continues below advertisement <p> But what if a customer is n't sure what product they want or need ? Can technology help them find exactly the right product ? That 's precisely the problem Mumbai-based Fluid AI set out to solve when it partnered with IBM and U.S. retailer The North Face to create an artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XPS ) . Using IBM Watson as the brains , Fluid created a customer service interface with which customers can find the perfect jacket simply by answering a series of questions posed by the application . Using natural speech processing , the app gradually narrows down the wide assortment of available products . For example , you can begin by saying , "" I need a jacket for a trip to Vermont in the late fall . "" From there , the program will ask you a variety of relevant questions . It may ask you what activities you plan to do . Or it may inquire about the weight of jacket you 'd prefer . As you answer each question , the AI will modify the potential recommendations , eventually landing on a few suggested products that meet each of the criteria you 've indicated . And it will only get better , because the more people use the program , the smarter it becomes . IBM was so impressed that it acquired Fluid 's XPS technology in October of 2016 . <p> And if you 're among those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what safeguards humans from obsolescence at the hands of technology , it 's important to know that SoftBank Robotics is building emotional sensitivity into its humanoid robot , Pepper . Pepper will not only respond to commands but will do so with sensitivity to the emotional state of its user . <p> While Steve Carlin , SoftBank Robotics ' vice-president , agrees that these are powerful new technologies , he in no way considers them precursors to any sort of robot apocalypse . At least for now , he sees the use of robots in the retail environment as limited to low-level operational tasks such as helping customers navigate the store or gathering basic information about products or services . He does n't anticipate scores of robots displacing people in stores any time soon . <p> Yet , according to a recent study from Oxford University , the impact of robots and AI on retail employment may be coming sooner than most of us think . In examining the likelihood of different types of workers being replaced by technology , the study determined that there is a 92-per-cent probability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , retailers everywhere will face difficult decisions in the years to come . <p> It stands to reason that companies such as Walmart will be watching such technologies with great interest . After all , consider that the company employs more than 1.3 million associates in more than four thousand U.S. stores . The potential cost savings from technologizing even a small percentage of that sales force would be astronomical . And Walmart is not alone . The retail sector is North America 's largest employer , accounting for more than 15 million workers , and in an industry continually challenged for profitability , the potential upside of replacing workers with technology has to be tantalizing . <p> But all this is not to say that we will soon be shopping in dystopian future stores devoid of people . In fact , while robotics and AI can be superior to humans at executing repetitive and linear tasks , there are as many things that they are poor at . <p> Story continues below advertisement <p> For one thing , robots tend to have weak fine-motor skills , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult and slow . Therefore , as retail spaces become more experiential in nature , they 'll require human beings to operate and demonstrate products for consumers . And artificial intelligence , while tremendous at retrieving factual data and solving linear problems , is not so adept at intuiting creative and sometimes lateral solutions , much less forging an emotional connection with a customer . Technology , on its own , tends not to be the optimal solution . <p> Above all else , what humans bring to the table is their humanity . The retail workers of the future will be creative problem solvers who use lateral thinking to assist customers . They will be adept with technology and employ clienteling and other technologies to expertly guide shoppers and personalize recommendations . The retail associates of the future will be brand ambassadors -- enthusiastic superusers of the products that the retailer trades in -- who can speak with customers from first-hand experience . They will be the ultimate personification of the brand . <p> And for all this , the retail associates of the future will not need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will have employers falling over themselves to pay them well because the retail shopping space of the future will marry the efficiency and effectiveness of technology with the expertise , enthusiasm , empathy and creativity of outstanding human beings .

"<h> Dailyhunt 's journey from classified ads to news aggregation <p> From sending out job alerts via text messages to curating content from more than 650 publishers in 14 Indian languages , Dailyhunt has come a long way . It is now scaling up its offerings to include video , audio and GIF content <p> Last Published : Fri , Feb 16 2018. 06 36 AM IST <p> Dailyhunt CEO Virendra Gupta ( right ) with his team at the Bengaluru office . Photo : Hemant Mishra/Mint <p> After spending close to 13 years in corporate jobs , mostly with companies in the telecom sector , Virendra Gupta saw a potential business opportunity in the Indian language mass media . In 2007 , Gupta founded the mobile value-added services ( VAS ) company Verse Innovation and tied up with top telcos to send job classified alerts via text messages . <p> Five years into the business , Gupta and his team orchestrated a pivot from a classified ad company to a news aggregator after acquiring Newshunt ( now Dailyhunt ) in 2012 to provide regional language news and other content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VAS ecosystem , with companies like Verse Innovation providing content like ringtones , music and pictures to consumers and sharing revenue per download with telcos , had begun to collapse amid regulatory concerns over the spread of spam and as mobile Internet started to take off . <p> "" When we were doing the earlier ( mobile VAS ) business , providing SMS alerts on information services like jobs , properties , matrimony , local language news on SMS , at that time , our main aim was to empower people with utilitarian information . There was no data on phones ; it was just SMS and USSD ( unstructured supplementary service data ) , "" Gupta , 45 , recalled in an interview . <p> Moving to an app-based business from a VAS structure was n't easy . Gupta says it was akin to shifting to a business-to-consumer ( B2C ) firm after starting as a business-to-business ( B2B ) company that worked with telcos to distribute content to telecom customers . <p> In 2012 , Verse Innovation acquired mobile news aggregator Newshunt , a small start-up that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just getting there . The company then made the transformation to a local language news aggregator . <p> "" So , we aggregated content and we took user inputs via SMS and USSD for differentiating various content , "" Gupta said . <p> "" As the country moved away from operator context services , and as WiFi and data became popular , we were working with Newshunt at that point of time , in the local language content . We were seeing that this wave was inevitable . The industry was starting to move towards data , wherein instead of a walled garden , you will have open ecosystems , where B2C business was promising . At that time , we started working with Newshunt , which was an application which aggregated news content in local language , "" Gupta said . <p> Indian language content had started going mainstream way back in 2008 . That year , Rediff.com , one of India 's early search and email service providers , started offering its email and other Internet services in 22 Indian languages . <p> The very next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their entry into the Indian languages space . Google launched a transliteration application on the web in May 2009 which let users type in Hindi using an English keyboard , and Facebook unveiled an option to surf its service in six Indian languages , namely Hindi , Kannada , Malayalam , Tamil and Telugu . <p> In an effort to ramp up its executive management team , Dailyhunt recently appointed Umang Bedi , former managing director ( MD ) of Facebook India as its president . Bedi had quit Facebook India as MD in October 2017 . <p> Newshunt had already started expanding into Indian languages before Verse Innovation acquired it in 2012 . A year before the acquisition , Newshunt launched an Android app in 2011 , moving on from the early Symbian platform . The app was originally developed by ex-Nokia employees Umesh Kulkarni and Chandrashekhar Sohoni in 2009 . After the acquisition by Verse Innovation , Kulkarni stayed back as chief technology officer . With a new management team , Newshunt ventured into the e-books ' space on the Android app in four different Indian languages -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In 2015 , Newshunt was rebranded as Dailyhunt in an exercise that required a major overhaul on both the design and the product front . The new app had a personalized feed , favourite tags , a fresh user interface ( UI ) and support for more Indian languages , namely Assamese , Sindhi , Nepali and Bhojpuri . "" We ( Dailyhunt ) are an Indic language-focused company . We do n't even think otherwise . We have just started adopting English language content a little bit now . Around 95% of consumption on our platform is non-English content . We only understood and focused on that market ( Indian ) , and we believe that it 's a very large market , "" Gupta said . <p> "" The next 200-300 million users who are going to come to the Internet are going to come only on local languages . And since we are a content company , I do n't think a mere translation of a transaction page into Hindi actually helps . In our case , we are a content consumption platform , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related very well to the user , "" he added . <p> Technology adaptation <p> Dailyhunt did n't expand by just adding new languages and sourcing more publishers . Like any other online content aggregator , it had to find ways to render Indian language text on mobile screens and understand what its users preferred to read the most using analytics . So Verse Innovation acquired BuyT , a discovery and recommendation tool in 2015 , to build a recommendation engine for Dailyhunt users . Not just that , the company used resources from the acquisition to build a native mobile advertising and monetization platform . Before rebranding as Dailyhunt in 2015 , it made most of its revenue from content sales in the form of e-books and other small content pieces . <p> In 2015 , Verse Innovation also acqui-hired Vauntz , a design and analytics start-up , to help scale up Dailyhunt 's machine-learning capabilities . Note that both Vauntz and BuyT were acquired before the rebranding from the earlier Newshunt brand name . <p> Vauntz was , perhaps , the company 's most important investment , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are reading in real-time . This allows Dailyhunt to create a personalized news feed for users , based on their past interests . Without showing relevant content to users , it would be difficult for an Internet company to retain customers . <p> "" In B2C , as you know , you are directly impacted by the customer . Customer gives you direct feedback . You have a lot more analytics , a lot more information , lot more ability to impact the product design using analytics . You can make changes to your product without going through a guideline given by someone else , instead you can simply rely on user feedback to make changes to your app , "" Gupta said . <p> "" I think there was a drastic shift in the mindset of the company ( after moving from VAS market to mobile apps ) . But so far , the core fundamentals of the company was about building a product for a mass market . The understanding of the business changed in terms of the KPIs ( key performance indicators ) we use , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build an analytics-focused Internet service , you also need to add more people skills , and more people in your company who are more design-led with more knowledge in analytics , "" he added . <p> Challenges in content space <p> Over the years , Dailyhunt has faced a lot of hurdles in the content segment . The whole landscape of the content industry evolved fast due to growing penetration of Internet in the country , with even news consumption itself starting to move online . From simple challenges like rendering Indic text , from when Dailyhunt started off as Symbian app , the problems have changed over a short period of time , according to Gupta . <p> Mobile apps require a lot of bandwidth to load content onto a device . Dailyhunt was content-intensive , and its second biggest hurdle was slow and patchy Internet connections . So , the company had to make a lightweight app that did n't require a lot of data . Moreover , when Dailyhunt started off in early 2012 , users had smaller mobile phones with very limited memory and this limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But as the smartphone industry started launching high-end phones at low prices , and as mobile data prices hit record lows , Dailyhunt saw its business booming . <p> Over the course of time , Dailyhunt started solving very different set of problems , as it started adding more publishers and new users . As of now , the app has over 50 million users on Android , Windows and iOS , with news articles being sourced from over 650 publishers mostly in 14 different Indic languages . <p> "" Now as users started coming in loads , now the problem was to figure out how to give a personalized experience to every other user logged in to the platform , and every other person that logged in . It became a game of personalization and content curation using machine learning . And if you try to do that with local language , the problem amplifies 10x , because you got to understand what the content taxonomy is , what the tags are . And you got to understand the preferences of the user base , based on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't ask any login information , we do n't have any information about you because it has to be seamless for users . So based on the experience of the user , and based on his clicks , we are refining the content , we are able to identify well-written articles , trending articles , breaking news , and other articles that the user likes and use this to construct a feed for the user . And that has given , you know , a 40% improvement in our click-through rate ( CTRs ) in the last few months , and we are on that path where we are hoping to improve this further , "" he added . <p> What Dailyhunt meant for publishers <p> As consumption started shifting online , publishers were facing the heat to expand their distribution channel among online platforms , and the biggest channel turned out to be social media . The likes of Facebook and Twitter have become a major destination for both consumers and news publishers , but these platforms also tend to limit how publishers reach out to readers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investing more money into online . But at the same time , they had to spend more money for producing digital content , making it visible among social media users , and by hiring social media editors and teams . <p> Pew Research in 2016 studied how regular social media users consumed news online . It found that 66% Facebook users it studied got their news on the site itself , while 59% of Twitter users surveyed consumed news on Twitter itself . Additionally , Pew Research highlighted in its 2016 report that a majority ( 64% ) of the social media users it surveyed , discovered news on Facebook only , while the rest consumed from other social media platforms . <p> But Dailyhunt is solving the problem of content distribution by just acting as a distribution medium , and are not directly impacting publishers , according to Gupta . News outlets are free to make contracts and end it on their own terms and conditions with Dailyhunt . Gupta said that several publishers have ended contracts with it in the past and have also come back after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the media companies , and in our case , we do direct partnerships with the publishers , we generate traffic and we share revenue with publishers out of it . So the amount of analytical data and information that we pass on to the publishers is much higher than what social media conveys , "" he said . <p> "" I think our proposition to publishers is very clear . One is , you got to be where the users are . Second thing is , digital is inevitable , now we work along with publishers to give them a lot ( of ) science about what content works and what does n't work , what are the stories and new segments that they can get into to produce new stories . And third thing is we give them distribution , and attribution on comScore for their reads , and we give them revenue . So , I think we have a full package around that , "" he added . <p> ComScore is a media measurement and analytics company providing marketing data and analytics to media and advertising agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In recent months , India has seen a growth in the number of companies expanding into the content boom . Big names such as Amazon and Netflix are going head-to-head with video streaming ; Indic-language-focused content start-ups like ShareChat , Clip and Pratilipi are attracting investor attention ; and payment companies such as MobiKwik and Paytm are adopting local languages on their apps to add more users . This means that content consumption trends in the English language front will also affect the Indic language front . New formats like GIFs , audio , and interactive videos have surfaced and most mainstream media companies like Facebook , Twitter , Snapchat among others have already adopted these formats . <p> When asked whether Dailyhunt would consider expanding into newer content categories/formats , Gupta said , "" In our view , we want to be a big destination for content consumption , from news , to non-news , lifestyle , women 's segment , among other multiple content categories . We are also expanding across multiple formats like videos , audios , text , GIFs . Definitely we are also looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our base in the future . Shift into digital is inevitable , it is not that we are driving the shift , it is what consumers are driving . People want information in real time , nobody wants to wait till tomorrow . So , this is how the consumer is dictating the ecosystem . "" <p> "" From a monetization perspective world over , ad dollars are shifting to digital and mobile and so and so ... I think as it shifts , we are one of the few content players , who have proved to generate a sizable business on ad dollars on mobile . You will not find many people doing this , and that 's a lot of hard work taken by businesses into establishing this . When the funnel gates and toll gates of digital advertising increases , we will be well positioned to make use of that , "" Gupta added ."
"<h> Japan 's once-dominant carmakers face pay hikes to lure geeks <p> Headhunter Casey Abel spent four months trying to hire a data-center architect for a Japanese automaker , including five meetings with the client -- one with the top executive . In the end , the information-technology ( IT ) specialist joined an e-commerce company abroad for significantly more money . <p> "" There 's just a massive mismatch in salaries , "" said Abel , managing director at recruiter HCCR K.K. , who has spent as long as a year trying to land some IT candidates .

Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn has said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for talent "" to new rivals , like Uber Technologies Inc. and Tesla Motors Inc . <p> Luring such talent requires big pay bumps in Japan because the companies are chasing the same experts that banks , tech companies and everyone else needs , Abel said . <p> The automakers "" operate within extremely strict budgets and the business is generally low margin .

Toyota located its so-called connected-car business unit and artificial intelligence ( AI ) research center in the US , which a spokesman said offer competitive compensation . <p> Hunt for professionals <p> Japan has had the most severe talent shortages in the world since 2010 , with IT professionals among the top three hardest positions to fill , according to Manpower Group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated 171,000 IT staff in 2016 and the number may more than quadruple to 789,000 by 2030 , according to a survey by the Ministry of Economy , Trade and Industry ( Meti ) . <p> That race for staff is accelerating . Nissan said in October it plans to hire about 150 engineers in Tokyo by 2018 for software , cloud computing , data analytics and machine learning . <p> Honda starts operation next year of a Tokyo research center mainly for artificial intelligence and IT . Volkswagen AG said this week it would hire more than 1,000 IT experts , tapping high-technology sectors , gaming industry and top-level research centers , in the next three years . <p> Toyota last month announced its connected-car strategy , which includes building a big data center to create new business using drivers ' data such as tailoring insurance policies to drivers ' habits , and hired former US defense scientist Gill Pratt to set up and lead an AI research institute in the US . <p> "" You need really good talents to do those really complicated things , "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Markit .

"" <p> Japan came last in Meti 's survey in terms of the proportion of respondents who thought IT was an interesting area to work , while Indonesia , India and the US ranked highest . <p> The Japanese corporations are following the lead of US rivals Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co . Ford established a science lab in Silicon Valley in 2012 to develop software , while GM has built two data centers since 2013 to streamline product development , manufacturing , marketing and sales , as well as connectivity services . <p> Honda is trying to address the salary issue by adopting a more flexible work and pay system at its new Tokyo lab , rather than the rigid , seniority-based pay grades used elsewhere within the company , said Yoshiyuki Matsumoto , president of Honda 's research arm , which operates largely autonomously .

"<p> Christie 's has sold its first piece of AI art , a canvas named the Portrait of Edmond Belamy , for $432,500 . The sale is unusual not only as a first for the 252-year-old auction house , but because the expected price for the print was between $7,000 and $10,000 . <p> The artwork was created by a collective named Obvious . The three members of Obvious , a trio of 25-year-old French students , used a type of machine learning algorithm known as a GAN ( generative adversarial network ) to create the picture . The network was trained on a dataset of historical portraits , and then it tried to create one of its own . Obvious printed the image , framed it , and signed it with part of the GAN 's algorithm . <p> However , as The Vergereported earlier this week , the Belamy print has been the subject of controversy within the AI art world . Obvious admitted to using code from another AI artist , 19-year-old Robbie Barrat , to create the print . It 's not clear how much was borrowed , but experts say the amount was probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a claim for ownership of the artwork as his code was shared under an open-source license . <p> In a press statement given to The Verge , Obvious said : <p> "" We would like to thank the A.I. community , especially to those who have been pioneering the use of this new technology , including Ian Goodfellow , the creator of the GAN algorithm , who inspired the name of the Famille de Belamy series , and artist Robbie Barrat , who has been a great influence for us . It is an exciting moment and our hope is that the spotlight on this sale will bring forward the amazing work that our predecessors and colleagues have been producing .

"<p> There 's been a lot of buzz around African startup funding over the last few years , and rightfully so . But even as the African startup ecosystem is still emerging , it surprisingly shows great potential for quick exits . Here are some examples . <p> The tech startup ecosystem in Africa may still be playing catch up with the likes of the folks in the west when it comes to robustness and pocket depth , but there 's no doubt about the amount of progress that has been made over the years . <p> For the better part of the last two decades , the African startup ecosystem has come alive with net investment amounts eclipsing figures from the previous year with each new year . While ticket sizes and funding rounds may still be dwarfed by the picture from the west , it is undeniable that there is some sort of feel-good factor around tech startups in Africa at the moment . <p> Hardly a day goes by without news of an African startup roping in funds from some investor halfway around the world -- it speaks of increased investor confidence in the ecosystem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andela early this year still fresh in memory , the continent 's startup funding figures are , once again , on course to rip the record books from 2018 where venture capital investments in Africa reached a record USD 725.6 Mn . <p> Interestingly , for a startup ecosystem that is still nascent at best , one thing that seems to have taken everyone by surprise is the fact that , beyond the funding frenzy , investor exits are happening at quite some pace . <p> Actually , on the surface , it does look like exits are still relatively rare in Africa , but doing some digging does indicate that there are many more African startup exits than is often thought . In fact , these days , it 's kind of a trend . <p> Acquisitions seem to be the most common route for investor exits and just yesterday we were , yet again , treated to the story of another African startup investor exiting via this route with the news of Naspers-backed OLX Kenya getting acquired by Nigeria 's Jiji , implying a possible exit for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this may have something to do with the relatively illiquid nature of stock exchanges across the continent . But even at that , Jumia 's IPO listing on the New York Stock Exchange in April this year , which could spell possible exits for its parent company , Rocket Internet , and a host of other investors , does come in handy as a decent lone example . <p> Well , here 's what we do know -- investor exits are n't as rare we think in the African startup ecosystem . If anything , they are actually more common than would be expected for an ecosystem that is pretty much still in infancy . And there 's been a number of major exits no one saw coming too . Now , let 's look at some of the most high-profile exits of the last decade . <p> A few months later , it followed that up with a USD 1.15 Mn investment from a number of European investors including Mountain Partners and business angel ; Dr. Cornelius Boersch , amongst many others . <p> All that was before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous competitor ) and added it to its subsidiary , Compare Africa Group ( CAG ) which offers a selection of online price comparison services across markets including South Africa , Kenya , and Nigeria . The 2017 acquisition marked successful exits for the startup 's investors . <h> Gyft ( South Africa , 2014 ) <p> In 2014 , South Africa 's virtual gift card provider , Gyft , which was co-founded by Vinny Lingham , C.J. MacDonald and Mark Levitt in 2012 , was acquired by US payments giant , First Data . The value of the deal was not disclosed , but it is believed to have been between USD 35 Mn and USD 70 Mn . <h> Fundamo ( South Africa , 2011 ) <p> It was the year 2011 when global payments giant , Visa , paid USD 110 Mn for South Africa 's mobile financial services company , Fundamo . <p> Fundamo had built quite a reputation as a platform enabling the delivery of mobile financial services to unbanked and under-banked consumers around the world , and Visa was seeking additional functionality for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was present in over 40 countries , including 27 countries in Africa and the Middle East , having raised a total of USD 5.1 Mn in funding from SA-based VC firm , Knife Capital -- marking one of many successful exits for the South African VC . <h> Kngine ( Egypt , 2018 ) <p> In March last year , South Korean technology giant , Samsung , parted with an undisclosed amount for Egyptian artificial intelligence startup , Kngine , to improve its virtual assistant , Bixby . <p> The startup , which was founded by a brother duo , Haytham and Ashraf ElFadeel , had raised its first investment from Cairo-based Sawari Ventures . The total disclosed investment raised by the startup before the acquisition stood at USD 775 K. <p> The details of the acquisition were not disclosed but according to publicly available data , Samsung through its VC arm , SamsungNEXT Ventures . had previously co-invested in Kngine with Vodafone Ventures Egypt in 2014 . But it bought the startup outright in 2018 , giving its previous investors an exit from the company . <p> The acquisition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was probably not the kind of exit they would have hoped for . Well , not all exits are happy endings it would seem . <p> Actually , this exit was kept under the radar given that it was a kind of a fail but it does come across as a "" high-profile exit "" -- albeit on a far less glorious note -- because it has all the makings of a major gaffe that was swept under the carpet . <h> Nimbula ( South Africa , 2013 ) <p> American multinational computer technology corporation , Oracle , announced the acquisition of Nimbula ; a South African provider of private cloud infrastructure management software , back in 2013 , for around USD 110 Mn . <p> In the end , exiting the company when they did appears to have been a good call for both Rocket Internet and Kinnevik , as the e-commerce platform was forced to shut down operations early this year in the wake of poor returns . <h> orderTalk ( South Africa , 2018 ) <p> In what was another successful exit for Cape Town and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company that develops online ordering software and solutions for the restaurant , takeout , and hospitality industry , was acquired by food delivery giant , Uber Eats , for an undisclosed amount . <p> The startup opened shop in Cape Town , South Africa , in 2005 , having been founded by Hilton Keats in 1998 on the back of an online ordering software development partnership with a U.S. restaurant chain . Knife Capital had invested ZAR 9 Mn ( USD 700 K ) in the South African-grown company whose core business is now in Dallas , Texas . <p> After initial angel investor backing , HBD Venture Capital ( owned by internet billionaire Mark Shuttleworth and subsequently managed by Knife Capital ) invested funds in the company in 2008 to scale the business internationally . <p> orderTalk was the final investee company to exit from the ZAR 150 Mn-HBD Venture Capital Fund that Knife Capital managed .

While the financial terms of the deal were not disclosed , Kirusa bought out the startup 's investors , bringing about successful exits .

This perspective piece provides a snapshot of how a range of digital technologies can be deployed to support a young adult 's efforts to cope with schizophrenia-spectrum illness . In conjunction with a day in the life of this individual , we provide examples of innovations in digital health research designed for this clinical population , as well as brief summaries of the evidence supporting the usability , feasibility , or effectiveness of each approach . From early detection to ongoing symptom management and vocational rehabilitation , this day-in-the-life vignette provides an overview of the ways in which digital health innovations could be used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management and recovery . <h> Introduction <p> Imagine a future in which the exciting digital health and computational psychiatry breakthroughs we are seeing today lead to the development of effective technology-assisted illness detection , monitoring , and treatment-support tools of tomorrow.1,2,3 Public-private partnerships , rapid commercialization models , and new regulatory frameworks will create opportunities to make these instruments widely available and affordable.4 "" Digital natives "" 5 -- individuals who grew up in the internet and smartphone era -- will be fully capable of using familiar technologies for personal health support.6,7 Our scientific understanding of psychopathology will progress to a point that we may no longer view psychosis as a fixed and hopeless state but as a continuum of experience that varies both across people and within the same individual over time.8,9 When these conditions converge , a range of technology-based and technology-assisted mental health resources will provide individuals with psychosis more opportunities to actualize their potential for recovery . In what follows , we describe what the daily life of a young adult in recovery from psychosis may look like in what we believe to be the not-too-distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junior year of college . She works part-time at a flower shop in her neighborhood , owns a 4-month-old energetic puppy that she adopted from the local animal shelter , and is in a committed relationship with her boyfriend of two years . Annie began to experience depressed mood and derogatory auditory hallucinations just over a year ago . Feeling anxious about her wellbeing , she Googled "" where do voices come from , "" "" hearing whispers , "" and "" do I have schizophrenia "" . The Pew Research Center found that one in three American adults have gone online to try to understand a health condition.10Google AdWords have been employed as part of a digital outreach campaign , resulting in over four thousand click-throughs to psychosis-specific psychoeducation , psychosis self-screening , and encouragement to reach out to local early psychosis clinical services.11 She completed an online self-report mental health screener that alerted her to a need for additional assessment . An online-administered screener for psychosis has demonstrated positive predictive value that exceeded that of clinician-administered interview in estimating psychosis conversion.12Risk calculators incorporating demographics , family history and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarly available online.13 As a part of this follow-up assessment , she recorded several prompted speech samples using her laptop , Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) systems with automated machine learning14,15have demonstrated promise in strengthening predictions of psychosis risk.16One approach deployed in a high-risk sample demonstrated cross-validated accuracy predicting psychosis onset.17 and received neuroimaging at a nearby testing center . Machine-learning analytics of functional imaging data generated correct identification of schizophrenia in a majority of newly diagnosed individuals . It could further predict which patients would respond to treatment with antipsychotic medication.18 <p> The early psychosis specialty clinic to which Annie was referred was nearly two hours ' drive by car . Her parents took the day off of work to drive Annie to her appointment . The intake specialist reviewed her online assessments and NLP results prior to her intake appointment , which permitted him to focus more on discussing her and her parents ' concerns , strengths , resources , and aspirations through the use of a web-based clinician support tool aimed to enhance shared decision-making practices . Computerized clinician support tools may enhance delivery of best- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour of the clinic , where she learned that she would be able to access her care team virtually , was introduced to her personalized digital health dashboard , received a brief orientation to her personalized menu of digital health tools , and received her first telehealth appointment for the following day . Annie and her parents were relieved that she would not need to travel back to the clinic for this appointment.20,21 <p> Like most of the adult population , including people with severe psychiatric conditions , Annie owns a mobile phone.22,23 In the 12 months since she established care , this personal device has become her primary mental health support system . Every morning Annie receives a tailored text message that reminds her to take her antipsychotic medications . Multiple approaches using text messages to remind users about their medications have been deployed and appear feasible and highly usable among people with serious mental illness.24,25 While she is eating breakfast Annie receives an instant message from her community-based case manager who reminds her that her driving exam is next week and that her rent is due . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that participants with serious mental illness respond to the majority of clinical messages sent by their community-based mobile interventionist and most find this intervention useful.26 Computer-based cognitive remediation training has improved her ability to focus and she was able to study the Department of Motor Vehicle 's driver manual without difficulty . Meta-analyses suggest that cognitive remediation interventions demonstrate positive medium effects for cognitive performance and functioning and small effects for symptoms.27,28 <p> Annie has a work shift before her afternoon classes . She found her job at the flower shop with the aid of a community-based supported employment specialist who also introduced her to a software program that helped her develop the skills and confidence necessary to pass the job interview successfully . Virtual reality job interview training has been shown to improve job interview role-play performance and real-world job attainment in a randomized controlled trial.29 The same specialist provides her with on-the-job follow-along support regularly via a supported employment app she uses to cope with job-related challenges and stress . A feasibility study of a mobile application designed to support the employment of individuals with serious mental illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the app to be user-friendly and helpful in providing on-the-job supports.30 She completes her shift and heads over to campus for class . Before entering the lecture hall , she experiences heightened anxiety coupled with auditory hallucinations that berate her , saying that she is not smart enough to understand this subject . This is not an uncommon experience for Annie . Fortunately , she has adopted effective technology-supported coping strategies ; she finds a private spot , takes out her smartphone , and activates her illness self-management app . Annie views several videos that guide her through a sequence of relaxation strategies and cognitive restructuring techniques focused on dysfunctional beliefs linked with the experience of hearing voices . A smartphone self-management intervention called FOCUS has been shown to be usable , 31feasible,32engaging , and clinically effective.33 In just a few minutes she feels calmer and is able to find her seat and fully engage in the class . She activates her smartphone to audio record today 's lecture . <p> Picking up her phone after class , Annie notices that she has an encouraging text message from her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been participating in an online group of family members of young adults with psychosis . Since she joined , Annie has noticed that her parents are less anxious when Annie talks about her symptoms . As a result , Annie has been more open and their relationship has improved . Proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated that online psychoeducation for individuals with schizophrenia and their family members is feasible and acceptable.34A web-based family and client psychoeducation intervention has demonstrated significant improvements in positive symptoms and knowledge about schizophrenia.35 Leaving class , she checks the likelihood of traffic on her commute on her phone . Because walking through crowds increases her anxiety and paranoia , she had been previously intentionally avoiding crowds on her commute . However , today , she decides to take the quickest ( but also busiest ) way home . Over the past few weeks , she has been challenging her beliefs about the dangerousness of crowds with a virtual reality ( VR ) self-training tool , and she decides today 's the day she 's going to give this route a shot . Virtual reality cognitive therapy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and associated distress.36,37 <p> When Annie returns home from class , she grabs a handful of pretzels and a soda from the fridge . She has an online session scheduled with her therapist just before dinner and wants to snack before the call . Individuals with psychosis use and are satisfied with clinical services delivered via two-way videoconferencing.38 As she drinks her soda , she fills out a brief outcome questionnaire on her phone that will be reviewed by her clinician ahead of their session . In the free-text window , she writes that she walked through the busiest parts of campus today and it went very well . Mobile apps deploying remote outcome assessments appear feasible and acceptable in specialty early psychosis settings , and generate ratings that are similar to gold-standard clinical tools.39Such systems provide opportunities for monitoring and personally tailored care . She is excited to share the news about her successful exposure with her clinician later that evening . During the session , her therapist displays to Annie her symptom assessment scores over the last four months of treatment . Annie notices that her anxiety has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have also become less intense and malevolent.40 Annie and her therapist reflect on this pattern and discuss the coping strategies that seemed to have helped the most . Guided by her therapist , Annie selects coping strategies that she will employ to help self-regulate distress during her upcoming driver 's test . Next , Annie and her therapist continue to treat her voices-related distress . Annie 's therapist presents her voice avatar on the screen , so that Annie can become more comfortable tolerating the voices and practice rational responses when the voice content is derogatory . A computerized treatment has shown therapeutic effects on auditory verbal hallucination severity by encouraging individuals to engage in a dialogue with digital representations of their voices.41This work has been extended in a randomized trial.42More immersive , virtual reality platforms have also demonstrated positive effects.43 <p> Because Annie 's therapist is still in a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Psychosis ( CBTp ) training program , Annie has consented to have their sessions recorded and reviewed by a CBTp-trained supervisor . When the pair log off , the session is uploaded to a remote server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition to personalized , specific , and prompt feedback on her competence and adherence , Annie 's therapist can virtually access continual education , support , and telementoring via an online portal . Web-based training , followed by peer-led consultation with previously-trained providers appears to be a viable way to enhance knowledge acquisition and **26;4997;TOOLONG among community mental health clinicians learning CBTp enhances confidence and affects their approach with patients.46 <p> Meanwhile , after logging off from her therapy session , Annie updates her online early psychosis community with a post to the group feed . She had been sharing her experiences with peers online and several others had encouraged her to try the VR program . She is excited to let them know that it was helpful ! An online social community for young adults with early psychosis has been examined in a feasibility study , revealing high system usage over a 3-week period.47 Annie closes her laptop and takes a look at her phone . She sees a calendar reminder that she 's scheduled to meet with friends for dinner and a movie . <p> On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In her pocket , her phone generates several new notifications reminding her that alcohol can exacerbate her symptoms . She remembers that a few years ago , when she was starting college and struggling with significant depression , she was drinking heavily . A mobile app supports the recovery of individuals with substance abuse concerns by providing them with information and support as well as a monitoring feature that prompts app users when they are near high-risk locations as detected by GPS.48 Annie has a great time at dinner and at the movie with her friends , and after the movie ends , like so many other Americans , she uses her rideshare app to request a ride home . While she is waiting for her car to arrive she kills time by watching today 's vlog update by an individual with lived experience she has been following who posts his recovery testimonials on YouTube . Survey studies suggest that young adults with early psychosis often turn to YouTube as a primary source for information and virtual community support related to mental illness.49,50 She chuckles as she reads some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with a serious mental illness not only cope , but also thrive . <h> Discussion <p> The peer-reviewed literature is now replete with descriptions of novel digital health approaches for help-seeking individuals with psychosis . The evidence suggests that individuals with psychosis use electronic devices , digital applications , and social media resources in a manner that is comparable to those without psychosis . Annie 's story paints a picture of how a young digital native may use a variety of technologies to improve their quality of life , extend symptom management into their day-to-day activities , and facilitate wellness . Many of the tools we reference in the vignette are in early phases of development ( e.g. , proof of concept , feasibility ) , and more rigorous testing is needed to ascertain for whom and in what contexts they are most suitable . Future developments will not only determine the specific components of these interventions , but how best to integrate them with existing mental health services . <p> The ubiquity and increasing utility of technology in our everyday lives may concern those who fear the overreliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technologies will replace human-delivered assessment and treatment . These concerns must be balanced with the potential for technology to enhance care and healthy practices , whether employed independently or with the assistance of a care team . The coordinated specialty care ( CSC ) model has transformed the standard of in-person care for first-episode psychosis , emphasizing a team-based , multi-element approach to address the complex and varied needs of this population.51 Still , significant barriers , including cost , workforce development , and community involvement remain in expanding access to these interventions.52 As demonstrated in Annie 's narrative , technology can be additive to human-delivered , evidence-based treatment . These technologies are consistent with the multi-component emphasis of CSC , as they connect her with others to create a team of community case managers , employment specialists , therapists , and people with lived experience that can help her succeed . <p> In many respects , this "" day-in-the-life "" is an ideal . In a typical day there are many opportunities for an individual experiencing psychosis to either engage in protective or risky behaviors . Over time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental health , functioning , self-determination , and quality of life . Emerging technologies may serve as the key scaffold to implementing effective practices in a scalable , personalized , and sustainable manner .

"<h> AI Spotted 11 ' Potentially Hazardous ' Asteroids That NASA Missed <p> An asteroid hitting Earth is one of humanity 's greatest existential threats , making it imperative that asteroid detection is a vital task for government space agencies around the world . Using advanced artificial intelligence , researchers in the Netherlands have discovered several "" potentially hazardous objects "" that were not spotted by humans . <p> The research , published in Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics , looked at space objects more than 100 meters in diameter that were likely to come within 4.7 million miles of Earth . The AI ran simulations 10,000 years into the future and discovered 11 asteroids that are not on NASA 's list of "" potentially hazardous "" near-Earth objects . <p> "" The resulting instrument named the Hazardous Object Identifier ( HOI ) was trained based on an artificial set of known impactors which were generated by launching objects from Earth 's surface and integrating them backwards in time , "" the researchers wrote in the study 's abstract . "" HOI was able to identify 95.25% of the known impactors simulated that were present in the test set as potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the potentially hazardous objects identified by NASA , without being trained on them directly . "" <p> "" Potentially hazardous "" NEOs ( Near Earth Objects ) are defined as space objects that come within 0.05 astronomical units and measure more than 460 feet in diameter , according to NASA . One of the study 's co-authors , astronomer and simulation expert Simon Portegies Zwart , said that now that the method works , further research is needed . <p> "" We now know that our method works , but we would certainly like to delve deeper in the research with a better neural network and with more input , "" Zwart said in a statement .

"" <p> According to a 2018 report put together by Planetary.org , there are more than 18,000 NEOs . NASA has been preparing for planetary defence from asteroid strikes for years .

In June 2018 , NASA unveiled a 20-page plan that details the steps the U.S. should take to be better prepared for NEOs such as asteroids and comets that come within 30 million miles of the planet . <p> Lindley Johnson , NASA 's planetary defence officer , said that , at the time that the country "" already has significant scientific , technical and operational capabilities "" to help with NEOs , but implementing the new plan would "" greatly increase our nation 's readiness and work with international partners to respond effectively should a new potential asteroid impact be detected . "" <p> In addition to enhancing NEO detection , tracking and characterizing capabilities and improving modelling prediction , the plan also aims to develop technologies for deflecting NEOs , increasing international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protocols . <p> NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine has warned that an asteroid strike is not something to be taken lightly and is perhaps Earth 's biggest threat . <p> "" We have to make sure that people understand that this is not about Hollywood , it 's not about movies , "" Bridenstine said at the International Academy of Astronautics ' 2019 Planetary Defense Conference in College Park , Md. , according to Space.com .

"<p> ( PRLeap.com ) December 14 , 2016 - The autonomous vehicle market is widely predicted to disrupt the auto insurance industry unless insurance companies can find a way to adopt to the challenges ahead . If providers can find solutions to be a part of the autonomous surge then the results could be hugely lucrative . Shop Insurance Canada says a recent report about the growing autonomous industry should highlight why insurers must adapt and be a part of the growth . <p> An autonomous market related to mobility and connectivity will develop over next 14 years , suggests KPMG . Indeed , a new "" mobility services market "" will grow to be worth well over US$1 trillion globally by 2030 says the research company . <p> The change in autonomous vehicles will be driven by deep learning , which will help develop an automotive industry built on mobility and connectivity . Deep learning is artificial intelligence at an advanced level , machine learning abilities make computerized decision-making more intuitive conclusions from queries and tasks . <p> KPMG released a report titled I see . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper the tax and audit company says deep learning will have a profound impact on the way car manufacturers will do business : <p> "" Deep learning is accelerating autonomy faster than anyone could 've imagined , and it has far-reaching implications for the industry and societal mobility as a whole , "" said Gary Silberg , KPMG 's national automotive leader . "" If a car ca n't learn , then it 's still reliant on millions and millions of lines of code , with such complexity and ambiguity , that full autonomy would n't be achievable for many years to come . "" <p> In the statement , Silberg adds that "" new era in automotive product development and manufacturing - one that emphasizes the car 's nervous system , which includes computer ' brain , ' sensors , controls , driver interaction and data storage even more than the powertrain . This is an enormous shift in organizational structure , talent acquisition and operating model for most car manufacturers . "" <p> The report suggests the auto industry is at a "" critical juncture "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way people use cars is changing . Autonomous vehicles will become a major market player in the coming years and insurance companies will have to adapt to the changing industry . <p> Carmakers will also face challenges , namely from tech companies who will muscle in on the autonomous market . KPMG says car manufacturers and tech giants will "" face off in a war for specialized talent . People with deep learning expertise are in short supply and the pool of experts among those specialists is even smaller . This makes it difficult for traditional automakers to compete with tech leaders . In addition , universities can not keep pace with the autonomous driving market demands for talent . "" <p> Challenge for Insurance Providers Insurance industry expert Shop Insurance Canada says that the advent of the autonomous industry presents insurance companies with a number of challenges . If insurers can overcome these difficulties then they will be a part of an industry that will grow exponentially over the next decade . Finding a compromise in the market would be lucrative for companies , Shop Insurance points out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must find a way to be a part of an industry that may not necessarily need auto insurance in the traditional sense . It has been well documented that liability on consumers may disappear and the car insurance market will decrease over the coming decades .

"<p> Dubbed the real-life Tony Stark , Tesla and SpaceX chief Elon Musk is often compared to the Marvel superhero . In fact , the 48-year-old has been credited by director Jon Favreau for serving as an inspiration for the on-screen fictional character played by Robert Downey Jr . Musk even makes a cameo in Iron Man 2 as himself coming face-to-face with Tony Stark 's character . <p> The adjectives Tony Stark uses to describe himself in the iconic Avengers scene may very well be applicable to Musk . He is undoubtedly a genius . With an estimated net worth of around $20 billion , he is a bona fide billionaire . He dates movie stars and gives generously to charity . <h> An abusive childhood <p> Musk was born on June 28 , 1971 , in Pretoria , South Africa . His mother Maye was a dietician and a model , and his father Errol , an engineer . Elon grew up with two younger siblings - a brother , Kimbal ( born in 1972 ) and a sister , Tosca ( 1974 ) , - both entrepreneurs . When Elon was eight , his parents split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Two years after his parents parted , at age 10 Elon "" felt sorry "" for his father as he seemed "" sad and lonely "" and took a decision that he would come to regret . He moved in with his father and realised that he was a "" terrible human being "" , Elon told Rolling Stone in a tell-all interview in 2017 . <p> Things at school were n't much better either as he was bullied for being the "" youngest and the smallest kid in class "" . However , life at school improved as he picked up judo , karate , and wrestling and shot up to 6 feet by age 16 . He fought off the bullies . Growing up , Elon taught himself to code and by age 12 he had sold the source code for a video game he created for $500 . <p> At age 17 , he took another life-changing decision , this time to move to Canada , his mother 's home country . He later got his mother and siblings to join him . <h> College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's University in Ontario , Canada , but transferred to the University of Pennsylvania ( UPenn ) on a partial scholarship two years later and graduated with an economics degree from the Wharton School and a physics degree from the College for Arts and Sciences . <p> The entrepreneurial streak that revealed itself in his school days would only strengthen through college . While at Queen 's , he sold custom-made computers and parts to fellow students to make money . At UPenn , Musk and a friend would turn their house into a party club of sorts , charging an entry fee at the door to cover expenses . <p> In 1995 , he began his PhD in applied physics and material sciences at Stanford University , only to drop out after two days to start an internet startup with his brother . The Musk brothers co-founded Zip2 , a city guide software for newspapers . The company was acquired by Compaq in 1999 for around $300 million , where Elon made around $20 million . He then founded an online bank called X.com with that money which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when eBay bought PayPal , Elon received $180 million . <p> Elon Musk dropped out of Stanford , two days after starting his PhD <h> Love and loneliness <p> Musk has admitted to being afraid of being alone from the time he was a child . <p> "" I will never be happy without having someone . Going to sleep alone kills me , "" he had told Rolling Stone . <p> Being in love is directly linked to his happiness , Musk had shared . "" If I 'm not in love , if I 'm not with a long-term companion , I can not be happy , "" he had said in the 2017 interview , at a time when he was self-admittedly hurting "" bad "" after his breakup with actress Amber Heard . The couple apparently broke up over intense work schedules keeping them apart . <p> Musk had commented on one of Heard 's Instagram photos : "" Long-distance relationships when both partners have intense work obligations are always difficult , but who knows what the future holds . "" <h> Marriages and relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's University when she was an aspiring writer in her first year of college , a year junior to him . In a 2010 article in Marie Claire , Justine details how the two met . "" He invited me out for ice cream . I said yes , but then blew him off with a note on my dorm-room door . Several hours later , my head bent over my Spanish text in an overheated room in the student centre , I heard a polite cough behind me . Elon was smiling awkwardly , two chocolate-chip ice cream cones dripping down his hands . He 's not a man who takes no for an answer , "" the Canadian novelist wrote . <p> Although Musk transferred to UPenn and moved to the US , the two remained in touch . After breaking it off in between , the two got back together and tied the knot in 2000 . The couple has five sons ( twins and triplets ) . <p> In 2008 , after the two ended their marriage , Musk began dating British actress Talulah Riley and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . They got engaged . Through the divorce proceedings , Justine discovered that the Talulah and she "" liked each other , "" calling the Inception and Pride and Prejudice actress "" lovely , bright "" and "" better fitted "" to Musk 's "" lifestyle and personality "" . <p> Riley and Musk married in 2010 , but divorced two years later . In January , 2012 , the tech mogul announced the news of the split publicly by tweeting at Riley , "" It was an amazing four years . I will love you forever . You will make someone very happy one day . "" <p> They would go on to remarry the next year in 2013 . But , the couple would end up filing for divorce again only to withdraw it and then again re-filing for divorce , which would finally be formalised in 2016 . The two however remain close and "" see each other all the time and take care of each other "" , according to Riley . <p> Musk and Riley have married and divorced each other twice . Image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Musk started seeing Hollywood actress and Johnny Depp 's ex-wife Amber Heard . But the relationship ended after a year due to the couple 's "" intense work obligations . "" <p> The Aquaman star and Musk remain friends and in an interview to the Hollywood Reporter in 2018 , she said , "" Elon and I had a beautiful relationship , and we have a beautiful friendship now , one that was based on our core values . "" <p> Elon Musk and Amber Heard have stayed friends even after their break-up . Image credit : flickr <p> Musk 's last known relationship has been with Canadian singer Grimes , whose real name is Claire Boucher . The two had met on Twitter in 2018 . Their first public appearance as a couple was at the 2018 Met Gala . Last year , there were rumours of a split after the two unfollowed each other on social media , but there was no official word from the couple . Despite the rumours , the two have been spotted sharing meals in places as far off as China . Grimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a WSJ interview this March , said , "" Look , I love him ( Musk ) , he 's great . "" It is unclear whether the two are still a couple . <h> Charity work <p> In 2012 , Musk signed the Giving Pledge along with fellow billionaires such as Bill Gates , Warren Buffet , Michael Bloomberg , and Facebook Founder Mark Zuckerberg . Bill and Melinda Gates along with Warren Buffett launched the pledge in 2010 , where signatories commit to giving away the majority of their fortune , either during their lifetime or posthumously . <p> Musk also has his own private charitable foundation that he set up with his brother Kimbal in 2002 , called the Musk Foundation . According to the foundation 's barebones website , grants are made in support of renewable energy research and advocacy , human space exploration research and advocacy , pediatric research , science and engineering education and development of safe artificial intelligence to benefit humanity ."

"<h> DeLaet eyeing September return after two years of injuries <p> When the RBC Canadian Open gets underway this week in Hamilton , Ont. , one of this country 's best players will be missing . Again . <p> For the second consecutive year , Graham DeLaet is on the sidelines , recovering from procedures on his back . It 's been a long , slow return for the Weyburn , Sask. , native who made his last start on the PGA Tour in October 2017 . But there is finally some light at the end of the tunnel . <p> "" I 'm slowly getting better , "" said DeLaet from his home in Boise , Idaho . "" I 've actually been playing golf three or four days a week . I started playing once a week , then two and now I 'm up to three or four . I still have to ride in a cart and I ca n't put in big hours practising yet , but I 'm getting there . "" <p> After dealing with excruciating pain in his back and legs , DeLaet opted to try a stem cell procedure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in fact , it left him feeling worse than before . That led him to the last resort -- the operating table for a microdiscectomy . <p> It was the second time DeLaet has had such a procedure . The first time came in 2011 on a different disc in his back . He missed the better part of a year following that operation . <p> For much of his career , DeLaet has played in pain , his back hampered by hockey injuries . He 'd require long periods with a physiotherapist before and after every round to stretch and crunch and twist his body just to allow him to play . Even with that , he played most of his rounds in pain . <p> At the 2017 PGA Championship , his back was so sore he could n't hit a single shot in practice . When he did tee off in the first round , he was in such agony that he almost withdrew after two holes . But he battled through the discomfort to finish tied for seventh . <p> Much as he did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery , moving step by step to build the strength and mobility in his back . <p> "" The surgery basically took care of the stabbing pain and the pain down my leg and the inability to sit for prolonged periods of time , "" he related .

But I have a stretching and exercise routine that I 've been very diligent on . Once I get moving I 'm pretty good . "" <p> While DeLaet is back to playing golf , he still ca n't practice for extended periods of time . His routine consists of about 10 minutes of warm-up and then out to the course for a round . <p> There are even small steps within that routine , such as testing out the body with a morning start time instead of the afternoon , when he 's already loose . <p> But the progress is such that he 's putting a return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 'll be back playing by September , "" stated DeLaet . "" My goal was to be back mid-summer , right around this time actually , but it just was n't realistic . So I started to set my sights on the new PGA Tour season that starts in September . "" <p> DeLaet is currently on a major medial exemption . When he returns , he 'll have 24 events in which to earn just over 266 FedEx Cup events to retain his exempt status . He is also allowed to play up to five times on the Web.com Tour as warm-up events and currently plans to make two starts on that circuit . <p> As he pointed out , making swings is just part of the return process . He also wants to see how his back holds up to things such as walking 72 holes , traveling on airplanes and sleeping strange hotel beds . <p> "" There are days when I really hit is nicely and I feel like a tour player again and shoot six or seven under on my home course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll struggle and the rust will show . I might shoot a couple under . That 's at my home track where I always expect to shoot a few under . It 's coming .

"" <p> While the 37-year-old misses life on the PGA Tour , the long layoff has allowed him to stay close to his family . Rather than being on the road or off at the course playing and practising , he 's been at home with his wife , Ruby , and three-year-old twins Roscoe and Layla . Now reality is returning . <p> "" That 's been a tough transition because it 's been almost two full years of being around the kids , pretty much all day long , "" he stated .

It 's also being held at Hamilton G&amp;CC , a course that he loves . <p> "" It 's obviously disappointing , "" said DeLaet , who has played in nine Opens , with a tie for seventh in 2014 his best finish . "" That 's a tournament that I love to play . The fans have always been really good to me , although they have a lot of good young kids to cheer for these days . I 'm kind of the old guy on the block now . Hopefully they 'll still remember me . "" <p> It 's doubtful anyone will forget the bearded one .

It had one significant expansion 25 years ago . <p> Gilgan says new facilities are critical to control hospital-borne illnesses and to harness the power of technology and medical research , which he believes will result in a Nobel Prize one day for SickKids research . <p> "" And to have what I 'll call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern science and then say let 's try to run that engine on a car with flat tires .

A new SickKids will rise , which will allow us to provide precision child health not to only more children , but to every single child that will enter our door . "" <p> Cohn said SickKids cares for some of the most complex pediatric cases in Canada and must be ready for a rapidly growing population in the GTA . <p> "" It 's SickKids versus the greatest challenges in child health .

"<h> How Is Nvidia Making Money ? <p> Recent comments from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang have thrust Nvidia 's ( NASDAQ : NVDA ) gaming ambitions into the spotlight once more : "" I think this may very well be one of the best gaming seasons ever . "" These words come just after the company 's gaming revenue was outpaced by its data centers for the first time ever . Nvidia , having also just released a teaser for its new 12-pin Graphics Processing Unit ( GPU ) designs , has left many wondering about the feasibility of the designs and if gaming is still the be all , end all . <p> With the much-anticipated GeForce event on September 1 , these worries will be put to rest as more information about the new GPUs will be revealed . This is a market in which Nvidia thrives as it wins many high profile clients such as Sony , Toyota , and Tesla , and continues to innovate . <h> Nvidia 's business model <p> Nvidia competes with Intel and AMD for the top spot in the GPU industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market share . The other product series which Nvidia produces is the Tegra system-on-chip processor . This chip is designed for smaller devices such as tablets and mobiles . The Tegra X1 , for example , is used in the Nintendo Switch gaming device . <p> Nvidia is all about innovation , it is a company that uses its passion to revolutionise technology . This is essentially how Nvidia works , through innovation and the development of processor chips that produce higher-quality graphics for gamers and designers alike . For this reason , its chips are also sought out as a solution to high volume information processing for data centres and cloud computing . <h> How does it make money ? <p> Normally , gaming is king for Nvidia , with its gaming business coming out with $1.65 billion in revenue for Q2 , a 26% rise year-over-year and far surpassing the $1.41 billion estimated by analysts . However , this was outdone by Nvidia 's data center revenue which actually overtook its gaming counterpart for the first time ever at $1.75 billion -- up 167% year-on-year and higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not represent a decrease in gaming for Nvidia , which is still growing , but rather a pivot into another key revenue stream . Datacenter revenue first breached $1 billion in revenue back in Q1 2020 and includes sales of GPUs that power AI systems for business use . <p> Nvidia 's GPU sales are mainly from PC companies such as Dell , HP , and Toshiba who integrate them into their computers . Consumers who already have a PC can choose to go through certain retailers to buy a GPU chip that suits their own custom requirements . <p> From 2017-2019 Nvidia 's growth averaged at 30% annually . 2020 did see an overall slowdown in the semiconductor industry and thus this GPU developer saw a 6.8% decline in total revenue to just under $11 billion . This can be attributed to a lessening of consumer demand for consoles etc . However , in 2021 it is expected that total revenue should increase to around $15 billion as data centres and consumer demand open back up again . <h> What 's Next ? <p> I purposely did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processors are an essential part of its AI projects and research , thus can be considered part of that revenue stream . In fact , the creation of neural networks and other hardware that accelerate AI learning and training are directly integrated with the GPU chip . <p> These new , upgraded chips which can accelerate AI processes will be likely used by data centres and indeed PC manufacturers over the next few years , leading to more responsive , intelligent laptops , whilst speeding up cloud networks and data collection . Any investors in the company could see Nvidia grow as an essential company in the increasingly digitized world we live in . <p> Nvidia 's presence in the AI world is clearly being recognized as it recently signed an agreement with car manufacturer Mercedes-Benz . They will work together to power its entire fleet of cars from 2024 . Nvidia 's GPU chips will become standard parts in the cars providing the software , and a full cloud-based data centre with machine learning infrastructure .

"<h> Who is afraid of Artificial Intelligence ? Column <p> A computer scientist explains what we really need to understand about what AI is -- and is not . <p> Nicolas Sabouret , a professor of computer science at the University of Paris-Saclay , France , is in St. Petersburg for a mini conference on artificial intelligence hosted by the St. Petersburg Conference on World Affairs . Read more at **30;3825;TOOLONG . Handout <p> By Nicolas Sabouret <p> Published Nov. 4 <p> Human beings have always built machines , and they have always feared their own creations . And so it is with Artificial Intelligence . AI is not new . The current excitement mingled with fear surrounding it happened once before , in the 1960s , shortly after its invention . At the time , experts of all sorts predicted that a revolution of machine intelligence was fast approaching . It was n't . People lost interest in that technology as the expectations foundered . Neither the over-excitement nor the disregard that followed were fair . It was purely emotional . <p> But Artificial Intelligence actually differs from previous human creations . It does not simply surpass human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loom , the printing press or the car , to cite just a few . It challenges humans in our preeminent field : thinking . We consider , with some good reason , that higher-level intelligence is a unique character of mankind . The possibility of losing this superlative quality frightens us . <p> However , Artificial Intelligence is not about building intelligent machines . It is about having machines do things that would require intelligence if done by humans . The difference might appear subtle , but it is not . There is a huge gap between thinking and computing . Edsger Dijkstra , one of the most famous computer scientists , compared this question -- Can a machine think ? -- to another question -- Can a submarine swim ? Submarines go underwater and they do it very well . But they do not swim . <p> The is no doubt about it : Artificial Intelligence systems will certainly surpass us in many domains . Artificial Intelligence already beats us at most strategy games . <p> When we drive , it can control our trips via navigation assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop our car before we rear-end someone . On our smart phones , we even rely on it to select the best information for us on social networks . But all this is achieved using algorithms that were patiently built by computer scientists . What we consider as "" intelligent "" is actually a program with no more autonomy than a cash register . <p> There is , however , a difference between today 's revolution of AI and the previous one . It is the possibility of accessing huge amounts of data to design parameters for the programs , instead of having to implement decision rules by hand as was done in the 1980s . This does not mean that the machine learns by itself . The term "" Machine Learning , "" in a similar way to "" Artificial Intelligence , "" is largely misleading . The AI program simply builds its decision process by finding the most probable patterns in the data it is provided . It does this in such a way that no human could ever do it . And the result is often so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is neither learning , nor thinking . This is computation . <p> We are afraid of what we do not understand . Understanding how AI actually works is thus a priority , so that the society can decide , in an informed way , what to do with this technology . <p> Nicolas Sabouret , a professor of computer science at the University of Paris-Saclay , France , is in St. Petersburg for a mini conference on artificial intelligence hosted by the St. Petersburg Conference on World Affairs ."
"<h> How Product Designers Will Shape the World <p> Environmental sustainability is a global challenge for many sectors , including product design . An upcoming , free UC Connect public lecture will explore how future product designers working on electric autonomous cars ; devices that incorporate artificial intelligence ; the gamification of education , training and rehabilitation ; and personal care and health products have the potential to both increase our wealth and help to shape our world . <p> If New Zealand is to become a wealthier country , able to lift wages and improve healthcare , social welfare and education , we must increase our export earnings , says the head of the University of Canterbury 's new School of Product Design , Professor Conan Fee . However , we can not do this simply by doubling the intensity of our farming or our tourist numbers , without placing an unsustainable burden on our environment . <p> "" How product designers will shape the world might be considered to be a rather grandiose title but placing this into perspective requires two things : an understanding of what product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' shaping the world ' , "" says Professor Fee . <p> "" It is important to understand that product designers do not simply add the window dressing , the artistic surface coating to make a functional product look attractive but rather engage in the entire process of problem solving , "" he says . <p> "" For example , eliminating the difficulties of manoeuvring a wheelchair while holding a cup of coffee or a mobile phone requires the designer to develop a deep understanding of the problem and current solutions , before creating new ideas and figuring out how the best of these might be realised in a way that truly adds value to the end-user . Who could argue a successful product design would not help to shape the world for some of the millions of people worldwide who are wheelchair-bound ?

"<h> Artificial still life : Artist Robert Todonai programs robot to paint an original <p> Robert Todonai 's robot took three hours to paint an Impressionist still-life , Apples . The 55-year-old artist spent much of that time watching it work , occasionally leaving his studio to make a cup of coffee and answer the phone . The $400 robot , which he built and programmed himself , continued , regardless , noisily squeaking and whirring away as it dabbed at the canvas . <p> It can paint the same picture repeatedly and without repetition . An original image -- in this case , of the apples -- is scanned into its memory . A brush stroke of random length , direction and position is generated , and is accepted if it fits within parameters , including permitted length , colour and overlap . The process is repeated until a simulated painting has been rendered , which is then painted . And because each stroke determines where following strokes are placed , each version is subtly different , yet still faithful to the original . <p> Todonai , from northern NSW , has been a working artist since 1983 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspired by how a 3-D printer extrudes molten plastic to create objects . He thought , why not spread paint on a surface instead ? <p> "" Although I designed the system , I am not entirely in control of the final artwork , "" he says , viewing the result as a collaboration . "" When I look at the robot working , and it 's doing things I did n't program it to do , and I 'm watching it working -- it 's quite fascinating . It 's pretty much like looking at a human artist , you do n't know what they 're going to do next . "" <p> Todonai submitted two entries to the 2018 International Robotic Art Competition , founded in 2016 by US mechanical engineer Andrew Conru , which challenged entrants to create "" visually beautiful "" paintings with robotics . He was placed eighth in July for Apples and a bust of Homer , winning $US2000 . The winner , Pindar van Arman , collected $US40,000 for his entries , which included a reproduction of Cezanne 's Houses at L'Estaque . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computers can be creative -- and what that means -- is becoming more pertinent as they grow more powerful . No one would ever accuse chess-playing computer Deep Blue of inspiration , but it did n't need to be inspired to beat world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997 -- it just had to win . When a Google AI beat the world 's best Go player in 2016 -- a board game too complex to crack using Deep Blue 's crude computational approach -- it produced moves lauded for their breathtaking originality . But similarly , it used a structured approach to suggest them . <p> Dennis del Favero , chair professor of digital innovation at Sydney 's UNSW Art and Design , thinks AI could be as powerful a paradigm shift in art as the introduction of perspective by Renaissance artists . AIs can already generate art that people ca n't tell apart from that of humans . The first human--AI pop-music collaboration was released in 2017 . There is an AI scriptwriter-director , and there are AI novelists . After beating humans at board games , is art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sophisticated as artists <p> "" I 'm convinced that human artists are more like AI than most people want to believe , "" says Robotart 's Andrew Conru . "" Human artists spend most of their time solving problems , using a set of skills and reproducible techniques which are similar to an algorithm . Each human artist explores different techniques which we read as their unique style . Similarly , every AI has its own ' style ' as their algorithms are different . "" <p> Robert Todonai 's robot painting a bowl of apples . <p> He 's seen entries become steadily more sophisticated as artists better understand the technical challenges . "" We have to come up with a new list of words for art now that AI is getting involved . What is great art anyway ? When is AI the tool and when is it the artist ? If beautiful new images and paintings can be generated by the press of a button , is it art ? We are entering the golden age of AI when the human can still be the maestro in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I ca n't say . "" <p> Automated art has been around in one form or another for centuries . Musikalisches Wurfelspiel -- dice throwing determining the order of passages of pre-composed music -- was popular in the 18th century . One attributed to Mozart , published in 1792 , has 45,949,729,863,572,161 variations . <p> But research began in earnest with computers and the search for artificial intelligence , with human-level creativity seen as an indispensable component of human-level intelligence . In the 1960s , A. Michael Noll , an engineer , wrote a program which generated a version of Piet Mondrian 's Composition with Lines . New York Times art critic Stuart Preston reviewed an exhibition of Noll 's work with alarm , fearing for a future in which the artist 's identity could be erased by machines . <p> Harold Cohen , an abstract painter and a professor at the University of California , San Diego , was a founder of modern computer art . From 1973 until his death in 2016 , Cohen worked with a set of programs which he wrote , collectively called AARON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and evocation and methods for making images that produce cascades of almost-recognition and associations in the minds of viewers "" . The results have been widely exhibited , including at the Tate Gallery in London . <p> The process used by Robert Todnai 's AI artist . <p> But was it creative ? Cohen thought not , once saying that debates over its intelligence could be answered if it one day signed its name on a painting : "" AARON is an entity , not a person ; and its unmistakeable artistic style is a product of its entitality , if I may coin a term , not its personality . "" <p> British computer scientist Simon Colton has defined a creative system as one which can produce novel and skilful artefacts -- and assess them . And Hideki Nakawaza , a Japanese artist who founded the Artificial Intelligence Art and Aesthetics Research Group , believes that "" fine art "" -- art created for its own sake -- can only occur when an AI follows its own goals , and not those of its programmers . <p> "" Aesthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , "" he argues . "" Creative autonomy will be achieved only after having self-consciousness . Consciousness precedes both consciousness of beauty and self-consciousness . "" Current AI art is still governed by human aesthetics , he says . True AI art , one of machine aesthetics , might be impervious to any notion of beauty . <p> Robert Todonai argues AI art has links to conceptual art and Sol LeWitt 's argument that "" the idea becomes the machine that creates the art "" . And AI artists are generating novel work using neural networks -- based on the brain 's architecture -- which sample huge collections of existing art . <p> Garry Kasparov , left , gives up in defeat against IBM 's chess playing computer , Deep Blue , at the conclusion of the sixth game of their rematch in May 1997 . <p> London auction house Christie 's is listing a print , Portrait of Edmond Belamy , with an estimate of $7000- to $10,000 in its Prints and Multiples sale on October 23-25 , created by a program written by the French art collective Obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Their six-month project used what 's called a generative adversarial network ( GAN ) , which was exposed to 15,000 portraits painted between the 14th and 20th centuries . One part of the GAN algorithm -- "" the painter "" -- generates a picture based on those portraits , and the other -- "" the critic "" -- rejects those it considers too different from its sample set . <p> A spokesman for Obvious says their program approaches human creativity without reaching it . "" The algorithm definitely emulates part of human creativity , such as learning through examples , the uniqueness of creations , and their belonging to a coherent ensemble . Creativity is a very special notion , in the sense that you ca n't replicate it without altering it . There are not two person on the earth with the same creativity , because everyone has been through different experiences and has assimilated them differently . "" <p> Christie 's specialist Richard Lloyd , who is organising the sale , says the auction house is trying to join the dialogue about AI and art . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new , and the image produced is technically unique , the work has much in common with many lots in the auction as the process of a printing machine . "" <h> Turing test <p> I TAKE an online test to see if I can tell whether a machine or human generated 20 abstract images . This one looks like the top of a human 's pale face on a mauve slug crawling through a gloomy landscape : machine . This a slash of red falling through a yellow sky to blue sea and a strip of green land : human . I realise I 'm assuming the ones in which I see meaning are by humans ; the others are by machine . I score 13/20 in this artistic version of a well-known concept in AI , the Turing test , which measures whether an AI can pass as human . ( The one I thought human ? Machine . ) <p> The test -- and the machine art -- comes from Rutgers University 's Art and AI Laboratory , led by Professor Ahmed Elgammal . They designed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75,753 artworks from abstract expressionism to synthetic cubism . Unlike a GAN , the CAN produces pictures slightly -- but not too much -- different from its data set . <p> Groups including artists and art history students have been unable to pick whether a picture was created by a human or CAN , and sometimes rated the CAN art more highly than the other contemporary or abstract expressionist examples . The CAN works were exhibited twice last year , one has been auctioned for $US16,000 , and a first-edition series is on sale . <p> Elgammal argues the CAN has developed its own aesthetic style . "" The machine was framed to follow the aesthetics it sees in art history but not generate art that follows existing styles , "" he says . "" Each artwork it generates is an answer to this dilemma . "" <p> Critics contend that algorithm-produced art focuses on style at the expense of social context , meaning and purpose -- that a masterpiece needs more than style to be a masterpiece . <p> But Elgammal says there has always been resistance to new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that there is always a human in the loop , but the role of the human and machine is varying . The machine is now becoming a creative tool which can explore and choose its own compositions , colours and other elements of art , within the frame that is set by the human . This is very much what happened when photography was invented -- it was not considered as a form of art until the 20th century . Indeed , photography changed the very definition of what art is . "" <h> Playing partner <p> Portrait of Edmond de Belamy created by an AI . Obvious <p> Jon McCormack , director of Monash University 's SensiLab , is interested in how humans and AIs can collaborate . The lab 's AI drummer , a work in progress , is an example -- recordings of a human drummer and musician are fed into it , demonstrating how they play together . Musicians are then invited for an improv session at the lab 's sound studio , which has room for a handful of people , technical and musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The AI drummer adapts its drumming to the musician 's playing .

If confident , it nods and smiles ; if really confident , it glows . If it 's not feeling the groove , it starts to frown and avoid eye contact . "" The goal is to develop a creative partner that can help you become a better performer , "" he says . "" It also never gets tired of performing with you , unlike real musicians .

US internet artist Darius Kozemi launched the annual NaNoGenMo contest in 2013 -- instead of writing a novel during November ( NaNoWriMo ) entries of 50,000 words have to be generated by a program . "" What I want to see is code that produces alien novels that astound us with their sheer alien-ness , "" he has said . "" Computers writing novels for computers , in a sense .

Sunspring was a 2016 collaboration between movie director Oscar Sharp and creative technologist Ross Goodwin . They fed dozens of sci-fi scripts into a neural network they named Jetson to generate a screenplay for the 48-hour movie challenge at a 2016 London film festival . The nine-minute result was gibberish , including lines like "" You should see the boys and shut up -- I was going to be 100 years old "" . But its three actors interpreted the dialogue as if it made sense , finding a love triangle not obvious in the script and resulting in something with emotional depth , if not meaning . <p> The same AI , which declared "" My name is Benjamin "" during an audience Q&amp;A in 2016 -- Sharp has referred to himself as one of its "" **26;2477;TOOLONG supplicants "" -- graduated to directing for 2018 's weird Zone Out , another entry in the 48-hour film competition .

"<h> Solidarity 's Du Plessis urges unions to move with the hi-tech times <p> Contrary to several populist unions ' belief that modernisation will cost their members jobs and the wildcat strikes that then ensue , the Fourth Industrial Revolution , with its plethora of hi-tech tools will allow skills development and create more , higher paying opportunities . That 's the message from Gideon du Plessis , Solidarity 's General Secretary in this reasoned , well-substantiated analysis , which , were it to be taken on board by unions across the board in South Africa , would help jumpstart our struggling economy . It 's a timely message as the country holds its collective breath to see whether President Zuma 's calling in of 400-plus troops to secure parliament for his SONA speech portends any shock announcements . It 's more likely that it 's merely a knee-jerk reaction to the EFF 's unruly ' pay back the money ' performance last year , combined with the thousands of protestors outside the gates whose behaviour set alarm bells ringing . Let 's hope so , because if Msholozi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will rekindle hope . Which springs eternal . -- Chris Bateman <p> By Gideon du Plessis* <p> According to Klaus Schwab , founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum , we are increasingly living in the time of the Fourth Industrial Revolution which will fundamentally change the way in which we live and work . Schwab describes the Fourth Industrial Revolution as "" unprecedented advances in artificial intelligence , robotics , the internet of things , autonomous vehicles , 3D printing , nanotechnology , biotechnology , energy storage , quantum computing which are redefining industries and creating new opportunities "" . <p> Similarly , in a speech delivered at Numsa 's 10th Congress in December 2016 , Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel warned metal workers that the Fourth Industrial Revolution is unfolding in an unstoppable way . Patel warned delegates to be mindful of the reality that the production and manufacturing model was in the process of changing . "" But do n't be like the first workers in history who tried to smash the machines that had replaced them . We ca n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of South Africa , during the Job Creation session at the World Economic Forum on Africa 2011 held in Cape Town , South Africa . <p> However , Patel 's advice is spot on because a Marxist trade union such as Numsa will have to realise that modernisation actually benefits metal workers as new equipment will have to be manufactured , repaired and maintained . <p> At the moment , certain populist trade unions are digging in their heels against modernisation of the mining sector . Despite a few exceptions where mines are mined out faster and jobs are lost at a faster rate as a result of modernising , modernisation brings many benefits . In the first place , it makes the workplace safer , especially where mining takes place at depths of more than 3,000m , and secondly , it stretches the lifespan of deep level mining of high grade ore where machines can be used at places where conventional mining methods just are not viable anymore . It also means that miners can earn higher salaries as a result of having acquired a higher skill set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with modernisation . Mining houses ' hidden agenda to use modernisation to counteract unhealthy labour relations , creates tension although the Department of Labour 's 2015 statistics , according to which 55% of strikes had been unprotected ( that is illegal ) , may well justify the employers ' rationale . <p> Gideon du Plessis <p> The fear that modernisation processes usually lead to job losses is unfounded . In any event , we as trade unions in South Africa only support modernisation processes if existing workers will not lose their jobs as a result of it , and the necessary training is provided to empower employees to get the hang of technological change . <p> A study , "" Artificial Intelligence , Automation , and the Economy "" , undertaken by the Executive Office of the US President in 2016 shows that routine-intensive occupations that focused on predictable , easily-programmable tasks -- such as switchboard operators , filing and admin clerks , travel agents , and assembly line workers -- are particularly vulnerable to replacement by new technologies . However , on the other hand , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make workers more productive , generally translating into salary increases giving workers the opportunity to afford more goods and services . New jobs are likely to be directly created in areas such as development and supervision . Reference is also made to the fact that while e-mail and e-commerce may have reduced the demand for the delivery of letters , they have not killed off the U.S. Postal Service . In fact , e-commerce has created an entirely new category of postal jobs related to the delivery of items ordered online -- for example , a company such as Amazon creates jobs for 600,000 postal workers . <p> The good news is that the Fourth Industrial Revolution has the potential to increase income levels in South Africa and to improve the standard of living and quality of life . For it to succeed though , modernisation has to be supported and skills development must be recognised by trade unions and politicians as the best form of worker empowerment ."
"<p> CANNES - Many a CMO is excited about the prospect of having machine-learning algorithms or artificial intelligence ( AI ) do the heavy lifting when it comes to harvesting actionable insights from the data onslaught . <p> But Kevin Akeroyd , GM and SVP of Oracle Marketing Cloud , does his best to let them down easy , pointing out that there 's still plenty to be done today . <p> "" Let 's not get ahead of ourselves , "" he told Campaign Asia-Pacific on the sidelines of the Cannes Lions Festival in France . <p> You know what , let 's get you really , really good at listening and responding to data before you get yourself all hot and bothered about machine learning . <p> In his view , many brands are not even listening to all the available data , tying it together and making an activation decision up into a consistent channel experience . <p> For example , he cited a scenario where a car brand picks up a tweet about a consumer looking for a new car , combines that with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the research he or she is doing , and then gets the brand 's cars and messaging in front of that user on the same day . <p> "" I 'm not even doing that yet as a brand , so the notion that I need to be up there in the stars doing AI or machine learning ... "" he added . "" You know what , let 's get you really , really good at listening and responding to data before you get yourself all hot and bothered about machine learning . "" <p> Akeroyd has no doubt that such tools will hit the CMO , but he believes that there 's much that can be done right now in terms of better integrating disparate data sources and enabling real-time responses . <p> "" I really think that AI is a mid-term solution , not a long-term one , and I think it 'll start to play out in three to five years , "" he said . <p> "" Will we be talking about AI three years from now ? Yes , "" he said . "" Doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , we 're at the stage of getting the fundamentals right .

"" We 've been talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there yet .

The world does n't need 3,000 ad-tech and mar-tech companies . <p> 2 ) Solution compression <p> Even within paid media , you are siloed , as you need multiple platforms just to get the same impression out of all them . Pick your flavour of consolidation , the tech giants will continue to amalgamate , and you 're going to see brands having more meaningful conversations but with fewer players . <p> 3 ) Managing across walled gardens <p> If I 'm a CMO , I recognise that Google is not there to optimise my budget , they 're there to optimise my spend on them , Facebook as well .

"<p> Rakesh Mohan Agarwal , Chairman and Managing Director , Indian Telephone Industries ( ITI ) Limited , talks about its dependency on BSNL and MTNL , cloud services and solution plants , current and expected order books , and margins during an exclusive chat with Swati Khandelwal , Zee Business . Edited Excerpts : <p> What is your view on the current position of BSNL and MTNL in the national telecom play ? Our , ITI 's , reliance on BSNL and MTNL has decreased to just 5% . And , our 90-95% reliance comes from other sectors exclusive of the BSNL and MTNL . We have a dependency on defence , BPNL , and projects of Bharat Net . <p> See Zee Business Live TV streaming below : <p> Let us know about the current level of implementation and acceptance of the cloud services and solutions platform that was launched for central and state government entities ? We have two data centres and the first data centre is 100% occupied . When it comes to the second data centre , which is a 1000-seater data centre , 356 racks have been commissioned and they will become operational by next month . The remaining 744 racks will be operational by March 2020 and then offered to the public . Thus , the level of implementation is too fast as 365 racks will be commissioned by next one month and the remaining racks will be operational and offered to the market in the next 4 months . <p> Let us know about the order book of the company and do you have some orders that will conclude in this fiscal ? We have an order book of Rs7,600 crore at present . The main order belongs to BharatNet , i.e. BharatNet Gujarat project is of Rs1,400 crore and BharatNet Maharashtra worth Rs2,600 crore . Apart from this , EESL 's Smart Energy Meter supply order stands at Rs850 crore . Manufacturing orders of small projects - like optical fibre , cable , HDP Pipe , solar panel , Wi-Fi equipment , smart banking cards and data centre services - worth Rs500 crore . Plus an order book of Rs700 crore is lying with 26-30 marketing service and project units . Thus , we have a confirmed order book of around Rs7,600 crore . <p> An advance purchase order of around Rs7,400 crore has reached us but we are waiting for their conformation . Besides , we have further order book of around Rs7,800 crore , where we are L1 in which the main project of Rs7,200 crore belongs to ASCON Fort Project - ASCON ( Army Static Communication Network ) phase I , II and III - and ITI has been doing it for the past 35 years and it has worked in all the three phases . Interestingly , some two years ago we reached the L1 position in it against L&amp;T , Sterlite , BL and DelTel . Of this Rs7,200 crore , Rs4,200 crore is the CapEx amount whole the remaining Rs3,000 crore is for OPEX ( operational expenditure ) . So , on combining the three , the order book will stand around Rs22,000 crore . Of this , the ASCON 's order of Rs7,200 crore will be given to us , soon , as indicated by the Defence Ministry and senior officials of the defence forces . We have been maintaining the ASCON 3 network for the last 12 years has expired and is running just on an extended-term . <p> What is the timeline for order book where you have reached the L1 levels ? Army 's order book has a timeline of three years for its completion but it was issued around 2 years ago , where we reached the L1 position in it . Thus , the project is getting delayed a bit and we are waiting to get the order . We have made commitments - during our last meet with the senior-most officers of the Army Headquarters - that ITI is in the position to complete this project in next 2 years time and have prepared ourselves for the purpose . So , we will complete the order on the fast track as soon as we get the order book . In fact , we will complete it within 2 years instead of 3 years , which is a timeline for the purpose . Similarly , the OPEX/maintenance amount of Rs3,200 crore will come to us for the next 10 years . So , the CapEx will be invested in 2-2.5 years and the amount for OPEX will be used in the remaining period . That is for the Army order while the remaining orders like an order from Gujarat will be completed in the next four months . We are moving at a fast pace in Gujarat and 40% of the work has been completed and the remaining 60% will be completed by March . Apart from this , the order form Maharashtra will be completed in the next eight months and EESL 's smart meter project will be completed by next year . So , the existing and incoming orders will be completed in the next four months to a two-and-a-half-year . <p> In terms of margins , what are the margin expectations for H2FY20 and what is your outlook for future margins ? We are , now , bidding on a very competitive basis . Apart from this , we have created a strategy which is different from the previous strategy in which we used to work on a back-to-back basis . But now , ITI has completed project management for every work that we have and that is coming to us . So , the margins for the products manufactured at our place - like Wi-Fi equipment , optical fibre , SDP pipe , smart energy metre , smart banking cards , data cell business among others - varies from 20-28% . Similarly , the projects that we have , like the Gujarat Project , is being done at our end . In this too , we are gaining 20-23% in terms of margins . However , the old back-to-back project like NFS project were lower margin cases for us as we were giving everything to the partners and earned a margin of around 3-5% only . So , the previous low margin era projects have come to an end and the new projects are high-margin cases . In fact , ITI will complete the Army 's project of Rs7,200 crore at its own level and it is a high margin case and we will have a margin of around 25-30% . <p> Provide the CapEx plan for FY2021 and update us on the current debt position of the company and how it will be reduced ? The government of India has approved a revival plan of around Rs4,164 crore in 2014-15 in which Rs2,264 crore was meant for Capital Expenditure while remaining Rs1,894 crore was OPEX expenditure . This means the capital amount is being funded by the government 's revival plan of which around Rs769 crore has been allocated to ITI . The government has the capital fund of around Rs1,500 with it . <p> There is a major change on the equity front , earlier , things were at par and our shares priced Rs10 were being allocated to the government at the same price . But , last year , we are trying to provide a market rate to the government because our IPO will come soon . So , it was an important factor as we want to allocate the shares to the government as per the market price . Even , the government has agreed on it . <p> The government is supposed to fund the CapEx - around Rs1,500 crore - for the next two years and the shares will be allocated to them at the market rate . Under CapEx , optical fibre is major equipment and we have our own plant for the same and we are supposed to expand it . We also have HDPE pipe plants and it should be expanded . <p> We are developing a new plant of the lithium-ion battery at the Bangalore plant . Solar panels are developed at our Naini plant and its backward integration will help us in developing a solar cell plant at the place . Similarly , we are planning a data centre at Naini . We are also technological company also now and have tied up with the Indian electronic semiconductor association in the recent past for 5G village , robotics and artificial intelligence . ITI will play a major role in new technology and we will be investing around Rs100 crore in that . <p> Just like Microsoft , are you planning to link with any other foreign player for your data centres ? Soon , we are going to invite tender for the operation maintenance and marketing plans for the Data Centre . So , all the local companies including the foreign companies are most welcome to engage with us because there is a transparent process in case of PSUs and that 's why I ca n't say that we will go with a multi-national but all big companies who are world leaders in those things will definitely be preferred ."
"<h> IoT news of the week for July 12 , 2019 <p> More on the Raspberry Pi 4 : We talked about this board last week : The Pi Foundation has shoved what is a full-functioning computer onto a $50 board designed for IoT or other intensive computing tasks . This article features a discussion with Pi founder Eben Upton about the changes to the design , which were done to appease industrial users . New elements including more serial interfaces , Bluetooth 5 support , and more processing power so it can handle inference are intended to help it gain adoption in the consumer and industrial IoT .

"<p> Well , now we know why Jeffrey Mace said he got too much credit as the "" hero of Vienna . "" Nonetheless , his backstory makes for another first-rate episode of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. , which in its fourth year has easily become the most enjoyable comic-book-based show on TV . I 'm hard-pressed in fact to recall a single episode this season that has n't delivered . <p> Part of that is due to the show 's handling of humor . I 'm not sure which producer is responsible for the steady stream of Team Whedon 's trademark one-liners we 've been getting of late , but I suspect it 's Jeffrey Bell , who demonstrated his facility for ensemble wit as the showrunner of Angel . Jokes alone would n't make this show , however , and S.H.I.E.L.D . has proven it knows exactly when to play a scene for laughs , in what has become the Marvel Cinematic Universe 's house style , and when to handle a situation as gravely as it merits . Yet even the throwaway gags are organic ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who throws a towel over Aida 's gruesome decapitated head when she 's told to keep up appearances . <p> The heart of "" The Patriot "" belongs to Jason O'Mara as Mace . Since his introduction this season , he 's been a mysterious figure who 's veered between sinister and silly , in the grand Mutant Enemy tradition . But here we learn the biggest secret he 's been hiding from Coulson and co. -- the fact that he has no powers but was merely a politician recruited by Talbot and the government to be the next Captain America in "" Project Patriot "" ( a project no doubt fast-tracked in the wake of Cap 's departure at the end of last summer 's Civil War ) . A vainglorious bureaucrat who literally tripped and fell into his job as S.H.I.E.L.D . ' s new director , he remains likable because he really did want to make a difference , and by posing as an Inhuman he truly believed he could help end discrimination towards them . In his own way , much like his original Golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Of course it takes the actions of Senator Nadeer to out Mace to Coulson and Mack , both of whom are paired with the director when their Quinjet is taken out by her friends the Watchdogs . Though Nadeer is nowhere to be seen this episode , we get some choice arch-villainy courtesy of Radcliffe and Aida ; both of whom learn it is n't easy to tranquilize a woman who despises tranquility as much as May . I 'm hoping the faux Melinda they 've replaced her with -- and who helps rescue Mack , Coulson , and Mace -- does n't stick around too long , just because we 've already seen a similar storyline play out back in season two . The fact that she might be growing sympathetic towards Daisy and Coulson also feels a little unnecessary . Does n't Aida ( of which there are now also two ) provide enough opportunities to explore the issues surrounding artificial intelligence ? In any case , it looks like S.H.I.E.L.D . will learn about the robotic mole in their midst soon enough since her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the meantime ... Fitz has never before acted like a bigger idiot than he does here by hiding his intent to fix Aida 's programming from Simmons , even going so far as to distract her by telling her he 's turned on by the way in which she "" goes all Godfather "" while interrogating the captive sniper hired by the Watchdogs to take down Mace for Nadeer . His actions are so distasteful they 've taken me past the point of caring about their relationship . Because "" Poppins "" deserves so much better . <p> By the way , it 's worth noting that we 're only two episodes into this back half of the season and I 've already stopped missing Ghost Rider altogether . Though I would n't be at all surprised to seem him race back to S.H.I.E.L.D . ' s aid when things with Radcliffe , Aida , and Nadeer go too far south . Until then , I 'm confident the show will remain gripping . There 's not a single weak player in its roster right now , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengths . <p> Declassified Deliberations <p> -- The Men in Black look suits Mack .

"<h> Author <p> Professor of Information Technology and Organisation , University of Sydney <h> Disclosure statement <p> Kai Riemer does not work for , consult , own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article , and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment . <p> You may have heard that algorithms will take over the world . But how are they operating right now ? We take a look in our series on Algorithms at Work . <p> Picture this : you have written an essay . You researched the topic and carefully constructed your argument . You submit your essay online and receive your grade within seconds . But how can anyone read , comprehend and judge your essay that quickly ? <p> Well , the answer is no one can . Your essay was marked by a computer . Would you trust the mark you received ? Would you approach your next essay with the same effort and care ? <p> These are the questions that parents , teachers and unions are asking about automated essay scoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reporting Authority ( ACARA ) proposes to use this program to grade essays , like persuasive writing questions , in its NAPLAN standardised testing scheme for primary and secondary schools . <p> In my view , this misses the point . Computers are unable to genuinely read and understand what a text is about . A good argument has little worth when marks are awarded by a structural comparison with other texts and not by judging its ideas . <p> More importantly though , we risk encouraging the writing of text that follows "" the script "" but essentially says nothing of worth . In other words , the writing of "" bullshit "" . <h> How does algorithmic marking work ? <p> Here 's how that could work : a machine-learning algorithm "" learns "" from a pool of training data -- in this case , it may be "" trained using more than 1,000 NAPLAN writing tests scored by human markers "" . <p> But it generally does not learn the criteria by which humans mark essays . Rather , machine learning consists of multiple layers of so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are gradually adjusted during the training period to associate certain inputs ( structural text patterns , vocabulary , key words , semantic structure , paragraphing and sentence length ) with certain outputs ( high grades or low grades ) . <p> When marking a new essay , the algorithm makes a statistical inference by comparing the text with learned patterns and eventually matches it with a grade . Yet the algorithm can not explain why this inference was reached . <p> Importantly , high grades are awarded to papers that show the structural features of highly persuasive writing -- papers that follow the "" persuasion rulebook "" , so to speak . <p> A teacher points at a board during a lesson at Stafford State School in Brisbane , Wednesday , Aug. 5 , 2015 . AAP Image/Dan Peled <h> Rewarding bullshit <p> Are the claims by ACARA that algorithmic marking can match the consistency of human markers wrong ? Probably not , but that 's not the issue . <p> It 's possible that machine-learning could reliably award higher grades for those papers that follow the structural script for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher consistency than human markers . Examples from other fields show this -- for instance , in the classification of images in medical diagnosis . It will certainly be quicker and cheaper . <p> But it will not matter what a text is about : whether the argument is ethical , offensive or outright nonsensical , whether it conveys any coherent ideas or whether it speaks effectively to the intended audience . <p> The only thing that matters is that the text has the right structural patterns . In essence , algorithmic marking might reward the writing of "" bullshit "" -- text written with little regard for the subject matter and solely to fulfil the algorithm 's criteria . <p> Not simply lying , analysts use "" bullshit "" to describe empty talk or meaningless jargon . Princeton philosopher Harry Frankfurt argues that talking bullshit may actually be worse than lying , because the lie at least reaffirms the truth : <p> It is impossible for someone to lie unless he thinks he knows the truth . Producing bullshit requires no such conviction . A person who lies is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that extent respectful of it ... For the bullshitter , however , all these bets are off : he is neither on the side of the true nor on the side of the false . His eye is not on the facts at all , as the eyes of the honest man and of the liar are , except insofar as they may be pertinent to his interest in getting away with what he says . <p> Unlike humans , algorithms are incapable of truly understanding when something is nonsense rather than genuine ideas and argumentation . It does n't know whether a text has any worth or relationship to our world at all . <p> This is particularly the case when incentives are tied to the outcomes of algorithmic decision-making . In the case of NAPLAN , we know that the government rewards schools that score highly . As a result , there is already an entire industry geared towards "" cracking the script "" of NAPLAN in order to secure high marks . <p> Imagine what happens when students realise that genuine ideas and valid arguments are not rewarded by the algorithm"

"<p> SAN FRANCISCO -- Amazon said in a legal complaint unsealed on Monday that it had lost a $10 billion cloud computing contract with the Pentagon because President Trump used "" improper pressure "" to divert the contract from the company to harm its chief executive , Jeff Bezos . <p> The Defense Department reviewed outdated submissions from the company and overlooked key technical abilities , Amazon claimed , saying those errors tipped the scale in favor of Microsoft , which won the contract in October . <p> Amazon had been considered the front-runner for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure project , known as JEDI , in part because it had built cloud services for the Central Intelligence Agency . Also , its Amazon Web Services business , known as AWS , is the country 's biggest cloud computing provider . <p> But Mr. Trump said publicly that other "" great companies "" should have a chance at the contract . He said he would take "" a very strong look "" at the JEDI contract , noting that companies including Microsoft , IBM and Oracle had complained about the award process . <p> Amazon 's complaint , filed in the United States Court of Federal Claims in Washington , said Mr. Trump had attacked the company behind the scenes to hurt Mr. Bezos , "" his perceived political enemy . "" <p> It would be improper for a president to intervene in the awarding of a contract , according to experts on federal contracting . <p> Amazon wrote that the department had "" failed to acknowledge the numerous instances in which AWS 's demonstrated capabilities vastly exceeded performance requirements -- while ignoring instances where Microsoft necessarily failed to demonstrate its solution met the technical requirements . "" <p> "" The blatant , inexplicable errors , "" the complaint argued , made it clear that "" President Trump 's message had its intended and predictable effect . "" <p> The Defense Department rejected the idea that Mr. Trump had meddled in the contracting process . <p> "" This source selection decision was made by an expert team of career public servants and military officers from across the Department of Defense and in accordance with D.O.D. 's normal source-selection process , "" said Elissa Smith , a spokeswoman for the Defense Department . "" There were no external influences on the source selection decision . "" <p> Janelle Poole , a spokeswoman for Microsoft , said : "" We have confidence in the qualified staff at the Department of Defense , and we believe the facts will show they ran a detailed , thorough and fair process in determining the needs of the warfighter were best met by Microsoft . "" <p> JEDI was formally opened to bids in July 2018 . The project was designed to modernize the military , from the Pentagon out to the battlefield , by adding more security , connectivity and artificial intelligence to the nation 's arsenal . Because of the complexity of the work and the prestige of the client , it was considered the most important contract the cloud computing industry had seen to date . <p> Amazon did not detail new instances of Mr. Trump 's direct involvement in the process . The company relied on his public statements and Twitter posts , as well as those of his son Donald Trump Jr. , and private comments reported in the press . Amazon argued that the president 's disdain for Amazon and Mr. Bezos was plain for everyone to see , including people directly involved in the procurement . <p> Amazon cited Mr. Trump 's removal of Jim Mattis as defense secretary as an example of direct interference in the JEDI decision . Mr. Trump directed Mr. Mattis 's replacement , Mark Esper , to review the JEDI bidding process . Mr. Esper had said he would conduct an independent review . <p> A speechwriter for Mr. Mattis said in a book published several weeks ago that Mr. Trump had wanted to give the contract to a company other than Amazon . <p> Amazon 's complaint said the Pentagon had begun preparing to award the contract to Microsoft on Oct. 17 . But on Oct. 22 , Mr. Esper said he was recusing himself from the process because his son worked for IBM , which had bid on the contract and been rejected . <p> The Defense Department announced a few days later that the JEDI contract would go to Microsoft . <p> Under pressure from Mr. Trump , the Pentagon "" departed from the rules of procurement and complied -- consciously or subconsciously -- with its commander in chief 's expressed desire to reject AWS 's superior bid , "" Amazon said in its complaint . <p> The company also said the Defense Department required Amazon to build new classified data centers to handle its material , rather than letting the company use its existing data centers that have been approved for classified use . This change , which Amazon said had come at "" the 11th hour , "" drove up the cost of its bid for the contract . <p> Amazon 's legal team includes Theodore B. Olson , a former solicitor general of the United States , who is now at the law firm Gibson , Dunn &amp; Crutcher . <p> Microsoft 's victory in the contracting process has the potential to reshape the cloud computing industry , which Amazon dominates . <p> On Saturday , Mr. Bezos spoke at the Reagan National Defense Forum , an event to discuss the nation 's defenses , and reaffirmed Amazon 's commitment to working with the military . Workers at other large tech companies , such as Google , have protested their technology 's use in weaponry . <p> "" My view is , if Big Tech is going to turn their backs on the Department of Defense , this country is in trouble . That just ca n't happen , "" Mr. Bezos said ."

"<h> Automation and Jobs <p> Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered the GPU Technology Conference ( GTC ) keynote address this morning to spotlight the company 's platforms that span all of computing , from a $59 Jetson Nano robot brain to massive data processing units that are part of its datacenter-on-a-chip strategy . <p> Nvidia 's big digital event is expected to draw 30,000 attendees for more than 1,000 sessions timed to accommodate a worldwide audience . The event is also coinciding with the digital Arm DevSummit , which starts tomorrow with a keynote chat between Huang and Arm CEO Simon Segars . ( Nvidia recently agreed to buy Arm for $40 billion . ) The whole effort is aimed at winning over the hearts and minds of more than 15 million developers worldwide . <p> Huang said Nvidia has shipped more than a billion graphics processing units ( GPUs ) to date and its CUDA software development kit has had 6 million downloads in 2020 . He also said Nvidia has 80 news SDKs available today and 1,800 GPU-accelerated applications . And he called the company 's new Ampere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> DPUs and DOCAs <p> Above : COVID-19 simulation in Omniverse . <p> Image Credit : Nvidia <p> Among the event 's announcements is a new chip aimed at making it easier to run cloud-based datacenters . Head of enterprise computing Manuvir Das introduced the chip , called the Nvidia BlueField-2 , in a press briefing . Nvidia described it as a data processing unit ( DPU ) akin to the GPU that gave the company its start in computing . <p> The DPUs are a new kind of chip that combine Nvidia 's chip technology with the networking , security , and storage technology the company gained with its $7.5 billion acquisition of Mellanox in 2019 . The Nvidia BlueField-2 provides accelerated datacenter infrastructure services in which central processing units ( CPUs ) , GPUs , and DPUs work together to deliver a computing unit that is AI-enabled , programmable , and secure , Das said . <p> "" This is really about the future of enterprise computing , how we see servers and datacenters being built going forward for all workloads , not just AI-accelerated workloads , "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software-defined datacenters , where more of the infrastructure that was previously built as fixed-function hardware devices has been converted into software that deploys on every application server . "" <p> Traditional servers have separate CPUs and acceleration engines for various tasks . But with the DPU-accelerated server , Nvidia will combine them into a more seamless group of services the company refers to as a datacenter-on-a-chip . The BlueField-2 DPU has eight 64-bit A72 ARM cores and a bunch of other components for accelerating security , networking , and storage processing . <p> Above : The Nvidia BlueField-2 DPU . <p> Image Credit : Nvidia <p> The BlueField-2X adds an Nvidia Ampere GPU and could be used for things like anomaly detection and automated responses , real-time traffic analysis that does n't slow that traffic , malicious activity identification , dynamic security , and online analytics of uploaded videos . <p> "" Nvidia is now introducing a new concept that we refer to as the data processing unit , or the DPU , which goes along with the CPU and the GPU , "" Das said . "" This lets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's really taking all of that software-defined infrastructure and putting it on a chip that is in the same server . We believe that the DPU belongs in every server going forward , regardless of the application workload running there . "" <p> Nvidia said a single BlueField-2 DPU can deliver the same datacenter services that might consume up to 125 CPU cores . This frees up valuable CPU cores to run a wide range of other enterprise applications . The BlueField-2 can handle 0.7 trillion operations per second ( TOPS ) , while the BlueField-2X with its Ampere GPU can do 60 TOPS . By 2022 , Nvidia estimates BlueField-3X will hit 75 TOPS . And by 2023 BlueField-4 is expected to hit 400 TOPS , or 600 times more than the BlueField-2 . <h> EGX AI platform <p> Above : Nvidia EGX AI Fleet Command . <p> Image Credit : Nvidia <p> Nvidia said its EGX AI platform -- which will use the BlueField-2 DPU and the Nvidia Ampere GPU on a single computing card -- is getting a refresh . The platform has already seen widespread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ datacenters . <p> The EGX AI platform will be the new building blocks of accelerated datacenters . Systems based on the Nvidia EGX AI platform are available from server manufacturers -- including Dell Technologies , Inspur , Lenovo , and Supermicro -- with support from software infrastructure providers such as Canonical , Cloudera , Red Hat , Suse , and VMware , as well as hundreds of startups . <p> "" AI in the past couple of years has moved from being exclusively in the cloud now to the edge , "" said edge computing VP Deepu Talla in a press event . "" There 's an enormous amount of processing that needs to be done at the point of action . We have to bring datacenter capabilities to the point of action , and Nvidia EGX AI is the answer . "" <p> Talla said manufacturing , health care , retail , logistics , agriculture , telco , public safety , and broadcast media will benefit from the EGX AI platform , as it makes it possible for organizations of all sizes to quickly and efficiently deploy AI at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location , Nvidia believes future enterprise datacenters will have one or more servers across 10,000 different locations , including inside office buildings , factories , warehouses , cell towers , schools , stores , and banks . These edge datacenters will help support the internet of things ( IoT ) . <p> To simplify and secure the deployment and management of AI applications and models on these servers at scale , Nvidia announced an early access program for a new service called Nvidia Fleet Command . This hybrid cloud platform combines the security and real-time processing capabilities of edge computing with the remote management and ease of software-as-a-service . <p> Among the first companies provided early access to Fleet Command is Kion Group , a supply chain company using the tech in its retail distribution centers . Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Illinois is also using Fleet Command for its IoT sensor platform . <h> Nvidia Jetson Nano mini AI computer <p> Above : Nvidia Jetson Nano 2GB is $59 . <p> Image Credit : Nvidia <p> Nvidia also showed the latest version of its robot platform , the Nvidia Jetson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as $59 and is targeted at students , educators , and robotics hobbyists . <p> The Jetson Nano 2GB Developer Kit also costs $59 and comes with free online training and certification . It is designed for teaching and learning AI through hands-on projects in such areas as robotics and intelligent internet of things . It will be available at the end of the month through Nvidia 's distribution channels . <p> In March 2019 , Nvidia announced a $99 version of the kit , using earlier chips . More than 700,000 developers are now using that kit , Talla said , calling it "" the ultimate robotics and AI starter kit .

This means professionals can engage with cloud-based immersive XR experiences and wo n't be tethered to an expensive workstation . <p> Weinstein noted that more than 10 million VR headsets have been sold worldwide , and he said the acceleration in recent months has been dramatic . Car dealerships are just one example of an application for this technology , with a dealer having one real car on hand for people to check out and many versions available for viewing on VR headsets . Data streamed from the cloud could allow people to see what the car would look like with different options , Weinstein said . Nvidia has CloudXR partners in companies such as electric car maker Lucid Motors , the Gettys Group , and Theia Interactive . With the CloudXR SDK and Nvidia Quadro Virtual Workstation software , partners can engage in remote XR . CloudXR on AWS will be available early next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "" You can stream the same rich graphics from a datacenter down the hall or across a campus or even from the cloud , "" Weinstein said ."
"<h> 7 Crucial Education Technology Trends for the Last 5 Years <p> The world is changing , and education must change with it . Many schools are aware of this fact and are trying to rebuild their activities in accordance with the opportunities offered by new technologies . Some universities borrow ideas from the business world , referring to the experience of successful start-ups in order to launch some new processes for themselves . Gradually , a paper routine leaves the schools , giving way to electronic means of working with data . <p> School as a Service <p> School as a service begins with the commitment of the state to each student as a digital student . When states reduce historical barriers , the transition to personal digital learning will mean a school service : access to quality courses and teachers from several providers . <p> Education SaaS changes the basic assumptions -- it does not need to associate time and place . This does not mean that everything will become virtual -- in the foreseeable future , at least 90 percent of families will benefit from local schools , but this requires new thinking , new staffing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with students and families . <p> Mobile Learning <p> Mobile learning , also known as m-learning , is an educational system . Using portable computing devices ( such as iPads , laptops , tablets , PDAs , and smartphones ) , wireless networks provide mobility and mobile training , which allows to teach and learn to expand beyond the traditional audience . Within the class , mobile training provides instructors and students with increased flexibility and new possibilities for interaction . <p> Gamification in Education <p> Gemification in education is sometimes described using other terms : game thinking , the principles of the game for learning , the design of motivation , the design of interaction , etc . This differs from game-based learning in that it does nt imply that students themselves play commercial video games . It works on the assumption that the kind of interaction that players encounter with games can be transformed into an educational context in order to facilitate learning and influence on students ' behavior . Because gamers voluntarily spend a lot of time for gaming , researchers and teachers are exploring ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the classroom . <p> Big Data <p> "" Big Data "" is a term that we are used to hearing in business , but it is also an important tool for education . Learning World explores this technological fashion word and talks with an expert on this topic : Kenneth Cuciere , co-author of "" Learning with Big Data . "" <p> Cukier sees "" Big Data "" as an opportunity to adapt learning to the individual needs of students and the learning process . Instead of avoiding this , teachers must accept changes that bring in large data , and use them to their advantage . <p> One example of the large data that occurs in education is the "" Course Signals "" , which allow professors to give feedback if there are early signs that students do not exercise or do not use class time . <p> Blended and Flipped Learning <p> Blended learning is a pedagogical method in which the learner learns , at least in part , by providing content and training through digital and online media using the student controls in time or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and integrated approach to learning . Blended training is combined with a flipped class approach to learning . <p> The Flipped class is a pedagogical model in which the typical elements of the lecture and the homework of the course change to the opposite . Students watch short video lectures or other multimedia materials asynchronously before a class session . Then , class time is devoted to active learning , such as discussions , design or problem assignments , or laboratory exercises . This learning model allows teachers to guide the teaching of students by answering students ' questions and helping them apply the concepts of the course during classes . <p> Massive Online Open Courses <p> Nowadays MOOCs may not be so widespread as when they first attracted attention , and people no longer think that this is the answer to the problems of educational inequality . Nevertheless , MOOCs still deserve close attention , as it develops as an important part of education , and it offers its students many advantages if used well . Moreover , The New York Times called 2013 the "" Year of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . <p> Personalized Learning <p> Personalized learning is a sort of adaptive learning that considers working with computers to make decisions , based on previous levels of learner understanding when interacting with a computer program . Learning analytics and artificial intelligence are the essence of individual learning because without them it would be impossible to easily adapt the instruction on the basis of immediate answers . <p> Personalized learning can seem like a dream in many schools , but it 's already happening more than we can imagine -- and often behind the back of the teacher . <p> The universities realized that technology can be a catalyst for improving the learning process . If many people enjoy using gadgets , why not to make them an education tool ? <p> About the Author <p> Richard D. Eddington <p> Experienced teacher and private tutor at Tuition Agency in Singapore . The range of interests includes the study of new technologies in teaching , the psychological aspects of learning and the introduction of educational innovations in the context of schooling ."
"<p> One of the ultimate goals of artificial intelligence is a machine that truly understands human language and interprets meaning from complex , nuanced passages . When IBM 's Watson computer beat famed "" Jeopardy ! "" champion Ken Jennings in 2011 , it seemed as if that milestone had been met . However , anyone who has tried to have a conversation with virtual assistant Siri knows that computers have a long way to go to truly understand human language . To get better at understanding language , computer systems must train using questions that challenge them and reflect the full complexity of human language . <p> Researchers from the University of Maryland have figured out how to reliably create such questions through a human-computer collaboration , developing a dataset of more than 1,200 questions that , while easy for people to answer , stump the best computer answering systems today . The system that learns to master these questions will have a better understanding of language than any system currently in existence . The work is described in an article published in the 2019 issue of the journal Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer the way they do , but our work helps us see what computers actually understand , "" said Jordan Boyd-Graber , associate professor of computer science at UMD and senior author of the paper . "" In addition , we have produced a dataset to test on computers that will reveal if a computer language system is actually reading and doing the same sorts of processing that humans are able to do . "" <p> Most current work to improve question-answering programs uses either human authors or computers to generate questions . The inherent challenge in these approaches is that when humans write questions , they do n't know what specific elements of their question are confusing to the computer . When computers write the questions , they either write formulaic , fill-in-the blank questions or make mistakes , sometimes generating nonsense . <p> To develop their novel approach of humans and computers working together to generate questions , Boyd-Graber and his team created a computer interface that reveals what a computer is "" thinking "" as a human writer types a question . The writer can then edit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In the new interface , a human author types a question while the computer 's guesses appear in ranked order on the screen , and the words that led the computer to make its guesses are highlighted . <p> For example , if the author writes "" What composer 's Variations on a Theme by Haydn was inspired by Karl Ferdinand Pohl ? "" and the system correctly answers "" Johannes Brahms , "" the interface highlights the words "" Ferdinand Pohl "" to show that this phrase led it to the answer . Using that information , the author can edit the question to make it more difficult for the computer without altering the question 's meaning . In this example , the author replaced the name of the man who inspired Brahms , "" Karl Ferdinand Pohl , "" with a description of his job , "" the archivist of the Vienna Musikverein , "" and the computer was unable to answer correctly . However , expert human quiz game players could still easily answer the edited question correctly . <p> By working together , humans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tested during a competition pitting experienced human players--from junior varsity high school trivia teams to "" Jeopardy ! "" champions--against computers . Even the weakest human team defeated the strongest computer system . <p> "" For three or four years , people have been aware that computer question-answering systems are very brittle and can be fooled very easily , "" said Shi Feng , a UMD computer science graduate student and a co-author of the paper . "" But this is the first paper we are aware of that actually uses a machine to help humans break the model itself . "" <p> The researchers say these questions will serve not only as a new dataset for computer scientists to better understand where natural language processing fails , but also as a training dataset for developing improved machine learning algorithms . The questions revealed six different language phenomena that consistently stump computers . <p> These six phenomena fall into two categories . In the first category are linguistic phenomena : paraphrasing ( such as saying "" leap from a precipice "" instead of "" jump from a cliff "" ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to a political figure appearing in a clue about something unrelated to politics ) . The second category includes reasoning skills : clues that require logic and calculation , mental triangulation of elements in a question , or putting together multiple steps to form a conclusion . <p> "" Humans are able to generalize more and to see deeper connections , "" Boyd-Graber said . "" They do n't have the limitless memory of computers , but they still have an advantage in being able to see the forest for the trees . Cataloguing the problems computers have helps us understand the issues we need to address , so that we can actually get computers to begin to see the forest through the trees and answer questions in the way humans do . "" <p> There is a long way to go before that happens added Boyd-Graber , who also has co-appointments at the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies ( UMIACS ) as well as UMD 's College of Information Studies and Language Science Center . But this work provides an exciting new tool to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is laying out a research agenda for the next several years so that we can actually get computers to answer questions well , "" he said . <p> The College of Computer , Mathematical , and Natural Sciences at the University of Maryland educates more than 9,000 future scientific leaders in its undergraduate and graduate programs each year .

"<h> Top 100 Reasons Not to Bomb Iran <p> 1 . There are over 80 million men , women , and children in Iran . Bombing them would be mass-murder.2 . If the U.S. government and its allies bomb Libya and Iran when their governments choose not to have nuclear weapons , you can forget about North Korea and the rest of the world choosing not to have nuclear weapons.3 . The longer the world has nuclear weapons , and the more countries that have them , the greater the likelihood of nuclear war.4 . We now know that even a small nuclear war can block out the sun , kill crops , and starve eve-ryone on earth who survives.5 . Bombing people makes those who survive and many who care about them very angry , which is why the "" war on terrorism "" has predictably increased terrorism.6 . Bombing people kills many , injures more , traumatizes even more , enrages even more , cre-ates huge numbers of refugees , and destabilizes the region bombed.7 . Bombing Iran will produce anti-U.S . and anti-Western and anti-Israeli terrorism.8 . Bombing Iran risks direct war between the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be bombed because of shortcomings and evil deeds of their governments , you 're not actually thinking at all ; you do n't want to be bombed because of the shortcomings and evil deeds of your government.10 . If bombing nations made people better off and created human rights , earth would be a para-dise by now.11 . Bombing countries is illegal under the Kellogg-Briand Pact without exceptions , and regard-less of whether Congress "" authorizes "" it . Another country bombing you would be a crime regardless of which parts of its government "" authorized "" it.12 . Bombing countries is illegal under the United Nations Charter with two narrow exceptions , and regardless of whether or not the U.S. Congress does or does not do anything.13 . One of those exceptions is when the U.N . Security Council "" authorizes "" a war . It has not done so in this case and certainly will not . And doing so would n't get you around the Kel-logg-Briand Pact.14 . The other exception is "" defense , "" but if anything is not defense it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has not attacked or even threatened to at-tack your country.15 . Attempts to provoke Iran into attacking U.S. military forces near Iran ( or to disguise some U.S. forces as Iranian and have U.S. forces shoot at each other , as Vice President Dick Cheney once proposed ) does not result in an Iranian attack on the actual United States or any legal ability to claim "" defense . "" 16 . Israel is not a U.S. state.17 . The Israeli government has been threatening , provoking , and lying about Iran for decades , which are not defensive behaviors.18 . Saudi Arabia is not a U.S. state.19 . The Saudi government has been threatening , provoking , and lying about Iran for decades , which are not defensive behaviors.20 . Iraq is not a U.S. state . It is the smoldering ruin of a previous war launched on almost identi-cal and wholly dishonest pretexts.21 . Not only waging war is a crime , but threatening war is a crime under the United Nations Charter . The United States has been threatening war on Iran for decades , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The idea that the government of Iraq or Israel or some other nation could invite the U.S. government to wage war against Iran in and from its territory does not exist in written law and would not legitimize yet another war in the eyes of the world.23 . Gallup polling finds that in most countries out of 65 surveyed , people 's top choice as the greatest threat to peace in the world is the United States government . This needs to be countered , not exacerbated.24 . It is hard to find anyone in the United States , and even in the U.S. government , who can even name every current U.S. war , much less every minor military action the U.S. military is engaged in . This is a sign that something has spiraled out of control.25 . Including recent U.S. wars on Afghanistan , Libya , Syria , Yemen , Pakistan , Somalia , and Iraq , the United States military has , just since World War II , killed or helped kill some 20 million people , overthrown at least 36 governments , interfered in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign leaders , and dropped bombs on people in over 30 countries . In many cases , these actions have undone democracy . In none have they created or "" spread "" it.26 . A nation possessing prohibited weapons is no legal , moral , or practical justification for war . If every lie about Iraq in 2002-2003 had been true , it would have been no justification for bombing Iraq . The United States did and still does possess nuclear , biological , and chemical weapons , and that does n't justify anyone bombing the United States.27 . The very same people who told lies about Iraq are telling almost identical lies about Iran . They 're counting on you to have no memory , no sense of judgment , no ability to resist fear mongering and fluttering flags . They 're counting on you to fall in line and obey like a drool-ing idiot.28 . In 2003 , Iran proposed negotiations with the United States with everything on the table , in-cluding its nuclear technology , and the United States refused . Shortly thereafter , the U.S. government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States urgently needed to attack Iran in 2004 , 2007 , 2015 . It did not attack . The claims turned out to be lies . Even a U.S. National Intelligence Estimate in 2007 pushed back and admitted that Iran had no nuclear weapons program.30 . The United States gave Iran nuclear energy technology and encouraged its use.31 . Iran was attacked with chemical weapons by Iraq , in part provided by the United States , and refused to use similar weapons in response.32 . Iran 's Muslim leader has forbidden the use or possession of weapons of mass destruction.33 . The CIA gave Iran slightly and obviously flawed plans to build a nuclear bomb , as part of an effort to frame Iran , and the man who blew the whistle on that to Congress , Jeffrey Sterling , was sent to prison as a reward.34 . The United States has imposed sanctions on Iran that have denied it green energy technol-ogies and caused significant human suffering.35 . It is one of the worst possible ways to blame victims when a government imposes sanctions that create deprivation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a re-sult.36 . Sanctions were used as a step toward war in the case of Iraq , and many in the U.S. govern-ment have been pushing for war on Iran since 1979.37 . These include lots of nasty old war mongers who do things like sing the Beach Boys ' "" Barba-ra Ann "" changing the lyrics to "" Bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb Iran . "" If we let them bomb Iran they will never shut up.38 . The United States has been lying about Iran having a nuclear weapons program for decades , as well documented by Gareth Porter and other journalists.39 . The 2015 Iran nuclear agreement was not necessitated by anything Iran did . Iran agreed to tougher inspections than any other country on earth has ever agreed to , and those inspec-tions have established that the agreement was not necessitated by anything Iran did.40 . The agreement was an alternative to war , which many in the U.S. Congress and media were clamoring for and demanding urgently . The failure to launch the war then or on any of the previous occasions when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that there is no need for a war.41 . The White House has made clear that it wants to manufacture any possible excuse to aban-don the agreement.42 . Eventually , after numerous broken agreements , the nations native to North America stopped making or believing in agreements with the U.S. government . The nations of the world will do the same , if the United States refuses to abide by its commitments.43 . Iran 's government is deeply flawed , but not in comparison with governments the United States arms and funds and supports.44 . The U.S. government facilitates weapons sales from the United States to 73% of the world 's dictatorships , and gives military training to most of them.45 . There is no correlation between where wars happen and where human rights are abused or democracy lacking or threats to world peace emanating.46 . There is no correlation between where wars happen and population density or resource scarcity or religion or ideology.47 . There is a strong correlation between where wars happen and where fossil fuels are pro-duced.48 . There is a strong correlation between which nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a strong correlation between which nations launch wars and which nations ' people accept war as a legitimate tool of public policy.50 . There is a strong correlation between where the United States launches wars and where that small number of nations remains that have no U.S. military bases and accept no economic dictates from the United States.51 . It 's good for the world , including the people of the United States , for such places to continue to exist , for the U.S. government not to become a world government by force of arms . Such an effort is doomed to failure and misery.52 . Look at a map . Iran is surrounded by U.S. wars and bases . Its government has shown more restraint than recklessness in that context , perhaps , than the U.S. government might show were the Canadian and Mexican borders ( in violation of laws of physics as well as of hu-mans ) lined with Iranian military bases.53 . S. figures , including Senator John McCain , have spoken often over the years of wanting to overthrow the government of Syria and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been disastrous in human and in its own terms . The larger criminal goal of overthrowing Iran will lead to more disasters if it is not abandoned.54 . Following the failure to overthrow Assad despite so much effort , a war on Iran would require extremely massive murder and destruction.55 . Think of all the crazy people who have ever held power in Washington , D.C. Attacking Iran was too crazy for them.56 . On February 27 , 2017 , Donald Trump said , "" Almost 17 years of fighting in the Middle East . . . $6 trillion we 've spent in the Middle East . . . and we 're nowhere , actually if you think about it we 're less than nowhere , the Middle East is far worse than it was 16 , 17 years ago , there 's not even a contest . . . we have a hornet 's nest . . . .

Trump campaigned for office , like most candidates before him , claiming to oppose over-throwing governments , and admitting what disasters are produced by doing so.58 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did thousands of other factors in that close election ) by turning against Hillary Clinton , believing she would be more likely to en-gage in more wars.59 . In fact , polling has long found the U.S. public to favor a significant reduction in military spending , greater use of diplomacy , and fewer wars.60 . Waging wars for democracy is not terribly democratic when the people do n't want them and are not allowed any say in the matter.61 . When Korea announced plans for peace in April 2018 , major U.S. weapons companies ' stocks plummeted , and propaganda for a war on Iran surged.62 . Congress and President Trump in 2017 pushed military spending up to well over 60% of the federal discretionary budget , stripping funding away from human and environmental needs at home and abroad . That trend of many years can not be reversed unless the wars are stopped.63 . Converting to peaceful industries would involve so much savings that anyone in need could be re-trained and assisted in the transition.64 . Bombing Iran would be an environmental catastrophe for the earth far outstripping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. military in preparation for the possibility of bombing Iran -- a possibility that grows with every threat of peace breaking out in Korea or between the United States and Russia -- is an environmental catastrophe for the earth far outstripping any green ener-gy efforts you 're engaged in.66 . A war on Iran would easily cost more than , and a small fraction of annual U.S. military spend-ing is more than , what it would cost to end starvation on earth , or end the lack of clean drink-ing water on earth , or make U.S. colleges free , or convert the United States to clean energy , or quintuple actual non-weapons U.S. foreign aid , or build fast trains connecting all major U.S. cities.67 . The way to alleviate refugee crises is to halt existing wars and put a fraction of their cost into aiding refugees , not launch new wars that leave many more people homeless.68 . A United States government responsible for providing clean drinking water , schools , medi-cine , and solar panels to others would be more secure and face far less hostility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefactor for far less than it spends making itself hated.69 . With every war for freedom we can count on losing more of our actual freedoms , and that would be all the more so with a war as crazy as an attack on Iran.70 . An attack on Iran would also require intense propaganda fueling the racist and Islamophobic bigotry already on the rise in the United States.71 . Results in the United States can be safely predicted to include : more racist violence , even more militarized policing , restrictions of speech and assembly , and a rise in fundamentalist religious hatred and gun sales.72 . Results in the United States can also be counted on to include : cuts to all human and envi-ronmental needs , and a major pushback against all progressive political initiatives in the name of war.73 . If the U.S. government bombs Iran , then that insane NRA video with Charlie Daniels de-manding a war on Iran -- which you may have thought was merely a ploy to sell guns to fan-tasy backyard warriors -- will have gotten what it said it wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government bombs Iran , Netanyahu will openly tell the world that the United States and its people are a bunch of easily manipulated chumps.75 . If the U.S. government bombs Iran , John Bolton will never be off your television channel , and any station without him will have his moustache on.76 . The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations claims that Iranian weapons have been used in a war that the U.S. , Saudi Arabia , and allies are illegally and disastrously waging in Yemen , cre-ating the single greatest human catastrophe on earth , the worst famine seen in ages , and the worst outbreak of cholera ever in the world . That 's not a justification to impose similar suffer-ing , or any suffering , on the people of Iran.77 . While Iranian militarism should be ended , Iran spends less than 1 percent what the United States does on militarism , and the comparison in terms of foreign weapons sales is even more extreme.78 . It is hard to find a war anywhere on the planet without U.S. weapons in it . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambassador 's claims about Iranian weapons pointed to the long-known fact that many of the weapons used by ISIS had once belonged to the Unit-ed States , many of them having been given by the U.S. to non-state fighters ( aka terrorists ) in Syria.79 . Alternatives to war include the rule of law . Iranians suspected of crimes , like Americans and Saudis and anyone else suspected of crimes , should be prosecuted or otherwise held ac-countable through processes of truth and reconciliation . Committing more crimes does not reduce crime.80 . Prime Minister Netanyahu should be questioned about sharpshooters murdering nonviolent demonstrators in Gaza , not listened to as he proclaims the same baseless lies about Iran that he did 16 years earlier about Iraq.81 . The United States overthrew Iran 's democracy in 1953 and installed a brutal dictator / weap-ons customer who lasted until 1979 . Iran has never done anything like that to the United States.82 . The United States shot down an Iranian civilian airliner , killing 290 people . Iran has never done anything like that to the United States.83 . The United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed the other non-nuclear nation on the list of evil nations , desig-nated part of Iran 's military a terrorist organization , falsely accused Iran of crimes including the attacks of 9-11 , murdered Iranian scientists , funded opposition groups in Iran ( including some the U.S. also designates as ter-rorist ) , flown drones over Iran , openly and illegally threatened to attack Iran , and built up mili-tary forces all around Iran 's borders , while imposing cruel sanctions on the country . Iran has never done anything like any of these things to the United States.84 . The United States now has a president who seeks the approval of people who want to bring about the end of the world in the Middle East for religious reasons , and who have praised President Trump 's announcement of moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem for just those reasons.85 . The roots of a Washington push for a new war on Iran can be found in the 1992 Defense Planning Guidance , the 1996 paper called A Clean Break : A New Strategy for Securing the Realm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 2001 Pentagon memo described by Wesley Clark as listing these nations for attack : Iraq , Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Lebanon , Syria , and Iran.86 . In 2010 , Tony Blair included Iran on a similar list of countries that he said Dick Cheney had aimed to overthrow . The line among the pow-erful in Washington in 2003 was that Iraq would be a cakewalk but that real men go to Tehran . The arguments in these old forgotten memos were not what the war makers tell the public , but much closer to what they tell each other . The concerns here are those of dominating re-gions rich in resources , intimidating others , and establishing bases from which to maintain control of puppet governments.87 . The reason why "" real men go to Tehran "" is that Iran is not the impoverished disarmed nation that one might find in Afghanistan , Iraq , or Libya . Iran is much bigger and much better armed . Whether the United States launches a major assault on Iran or Israel does , Iran will retaliate against U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . And the United States will without any doubt re-retaliate for that . Iran can not be unaware that the U.S. government 's pressure on the Is-raeli government not to attack Iran consists of reassuring the Israelis that the United States will attack when needed , and does not include even threatening to stop funding Israel 's military or to stop vetoing measures of accountability for Israeli crimes at the United Nations . President Obama 's am-bassador refrained from one veto on illegal settlements , while President-Elect Trump lobbied foreign governments to block the resolution.88 . As in any country , no matter what its government , the people of Iran are fundamentally good , decent , peaceful , just , and fundamentally like you and me . I 've met people from Iran . You may have met people from Iran . They 're not a different species . They 're not evil . A "" surgical strike "" against a "" facility "" in their country would cause a great many of them to die very painful and horrible deaths.89 . The proponents of attacking Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use them . This is from the American Enterprise Institute : "" The biggest problem for the United States is not Iran getting a nuclear weapon and testing it , it 's Iran getting a nuclear weapon and not using it . Because the second that they have one and they do n't do anything bad , all of the naysayers are going to come back and say , ' See , we told you Iran is a responsible power . We told you Iran was n't getting nuclear weapons in order to use them immediately . ' ... And they will eventually define Iran with nuclear weapons as not a problem . "" Is that clear ? Iran using a nuclear weapon would be bad . But what would be really bad would be Iran ac-quiring a nuclear weapon and doing what every other nation with them has done since Naga-saki : nothing . That would be really bad because it would damage an argument for war and make war more difficult , thus allowing Iran to run its country as it , rather than the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly ( although we 're hardly establishing a model for the world over here either ) , but it would run it without U.S. approval , and cease to be an argument for military spending increases , and that would be worse than nuclear de-struction.90 . Ahmadinejad did not say "" Israel should be wiped off the map . "" A more accurate translation was "" the regime occupying Jerusalem must vanish from the page of time . "" The government of Israel , not the nation of Israel . Not even the government of Israel , but the current regime . Hell , Americans say that about their own regimes all the time , alternating every four to eight years depending on political party . Iran has made clear it would approve of a two-state solu-tion if Palestinians approved of it.91 . Violent solutions are less likely to succeed than nonviolent ones , especially violent solutions in search of a problem to justify them . The tools of nonviolence are developing quickly and racking up successes . They are more likely to achieve good ends , and those successes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government needs to catch up with the times.92 . The choices are not ( a ) bomb another country , or ( b ) do nothing . Other choices include aid , diplomacy , the rule of law , disarmament . Every time people try to urgently rush us into a bad choice , we can point out all the years in which we could have been transforming the world with a whole variety of good choices.93 . We could start making those choices now . But those who want peace have to be as orga-nized and determined as those who want war . We have to actively demand diplomacy and sanctions relief and aid and cooperation and arms embargoes and conversion.94 . There is no such thing as arriving at a war as a last resort . War is a choice . A "" hawk "" is noth-ing other than someone who prefers to choose war.95 . There is everything to be gained by making peace with Iran , governmentally , culturally , eco-nomically.96 . Persian history is at the roots of Western history and could be studied as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces wonderful art , films , books , food , and a soccer team that actually qualifies for the world cup would be far preferable to yet more war.98 . A U.S. war on Iran , with or without a handful of partners or sidekicks , would unite the people of Iran and much of the world against the United States . It would justify in the eyes of much of the world an underground Iranian program to develop nuclear weapons , a program that does not now exist.99 . The environmental damage would be tremendous , the precedent set incredibly dangerous , all talk of cutting the U.S. military budget would be buried in a wave of war frenzy , civil liber-ties and representative government would be flushed down the Potomac , a nuclear arms race would spread to additional countries , and any momentary sadistic glee would be out-weighed by accelerating home foreclosures , mounting student debt , and accumulating layers of cultural stupidity100 . The "" news "" broadcasters who called Trump "" presidential "" when he started bombing people on a small scale would declare him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iran . <p> The media reports the facts .... but that 's not the end of it , and nor should it be . It also marshals those facts and creates a story from them , usually one with a moral that 's implied or explicit . After six months though , it is still unclear just what the dominant media narrative is of the coalition government . Is it Idealistic But Impractical ? Is its Heart in the Right Place , but is it Taking On Too Much ? Is the coalition proving to be Fractious And Unstable , or is it Surprisingly Adept at Keeping Its Inherent Rifts Out of the Public Eye ?

"<h> Read Next <p> MachineHack successfully concluded its ninth installment of the weekend hackathon series on June 22 . The ODI Match Winner Prediction hackathon was welcomed by data science enthusiasts with over 400 registrations and active participation from close to 218 practitioners . <p> Out of the 213 competitors , three topped our leaderboard . In this article , we will introduce you to the winners and describe the approach they took to solve the problem : <h> Mrutyunjaya Rath <p> Besides being a graduate in Mechanical Engineering , data and coding have always excited him . He started his data science journey by doing a course with upGrad in association with IIIT-B . Although he found it to be a little difficult at the beginning , continuous practice gave him the confidence and skills to pursue this path . <p> He spends most of his time participating in hackathons and acquiring new skills by learning new techniques . "" You will succeed in some of the approaches , while in some , you will fail miserably ; that is something which is exciting about data science , "" he said . <h> Approach To Solving The Problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After putting a lot of thinking on how to approach the problem , I stacked both Team 1 and Team 2 features and performed one-hot encoding . Similarly , I one-hot encoded the Host country feature . The rest of the categorical variables were handled through Label Encoder . I tried grouping-by some categorical variables and made some statistical features , but it did not work . After that , I went on to build models and tuned the parameters using early stopping . XGBoost gave me the best result for this particular problem . <p> "" MachineHack is one of the best platforms for any data science enthusiast . Not only can you compete here , but you also get to know your participants , which leads to an increase in your connections , and you get to talk and interact with like-minded people . I would like to thank MachineHack and Analytics India Magazine for organizing this hackathon , and also for their contribution towards the data science and machine learning community . I would also like to congratulate my fellow participants who managed to put a score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betta <p> Anil had no interest in programming during his engineering days , but he had a great deal of interest in mathematics , especially statistics . He soon came across a domain in Computer Science which involved a lot of Math and Statistics , and thus , he started his journey in Data Analytics . He did some online courses on the subject and later came across Kaggle where he acquired his skills through open kernels and blogs . <p> The ongoing pandemic forced him to use his time in participating in hackathons by MachineHack , among other platforms . Anil is currently working as an ML Engineer at Opteamix . "" Thanks to MachineHack for organising these interesting weekend hackathons from which I am learning continuously , "" he said . <h> Approach To Solving The Problem <p> Anil explains his approach as follows : <p> Key thing was to convert the multi-class classification into binary classification . This is because predicting the winning probability for other teams , when Team-A is playing against Team-B , does n't make any sense . This approach helped massively where my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created a Team Rank feature based on the value counts of MatchWinner with respect to Team . <p> I Added a number of group-by aggregate features on both numerical and categorical features . <p> Then , I created group-by n-unique features . <p> I created interaction features ( combining 2 features ) . <p> Frequency encoding on categorical features gave a decent boost in score . <p> Created Team Experience feature based on the number of unique stadiums each team played in."
"<p> Researchers are a step forward in quickly detecting cancer drug resistance as it emerges and identifying another drug that tumours will still respond to by using liquid biopsies . According to the team , their findings could inform more personalised therapeutics . <p> The group of researchers from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard , Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) , IBM Research , all US and other organisations examined a new method for sampling tumours known as liquid biopsy -- a blood sample from a patient that contains DNA shed from tumours , called circulating tumour DNA , or ctDNA , which can be isolated and analysed . <p> The research team compared the results of both liquid and standard tissue biopsies from patients who were treated for gastrointestinal cancer but developed drug resistance . The findings have revealed that liquid biopsies provide a more complete picture of both the genetic diversity of a patient 's cancer and how tumours evolve drug resistance at the molecular level . <p> "" Nearly every patient we analysed had developed not just one , but multiple drug resistance mechanisms simultaneously and this may be more common than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the study , director of the Cancer Genome Computational Analysis Group at the Broad and the Paul C. Zamecnik Chair in Oncology at the MGH Cancer Center . <p> The study also suggests possible molecular mechanisms underlying drug resistance , which could point the way to new and more personalised therapeutics . <p> To investigate the utility of liquid biopsies in detecting acquired drug resistance in cancer , the researchers studied 42 patients with different forms of gastrointestinal cancer who were undergoing treatment with targeted drugs . When the patients showed signs of drug resistance , the researchers analysed their tumours using both liquid and tissue biopsies . <p> They harnessed a suite of computational tools known as PhylogicNDT , to analyse the tumour DNA and their resistance mutations . A head-to-head comparison of liquid and tissue biopsies revealed that in nearly 80 percent of cases , the liquid biopsies unearthed clinically relevant genetic alterations linked to drug resistance that were not identified through standard tissue biopsies . <p> Analysis of DNA from several of the patients in the study did not show clear resistance mechanisms . To learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team developed machine learning algorithms to group patients together according to shared or similar patterns of genetic alterations linked to drug resistance . By doing this , the researchers were able to suggest possible resistance mechanisms for these cases . <p> We use cookies to improve your experience on our site and to show you relevant advertising .

"<h> 0 <p> IBM is taking another step to expand its Watson AI business and build its presence in areas like IoT : today the company announced that its acquisition of the Weather Company -- the giant weather media and data group -- has now officially closed . <p> IBM is not disclosing the value of the deal : it was originally reported to be in the region of $2 billion , but sources close to IBM tell us this was inaccurate . ( For context , the Weather Company was previously acquired in 2008 for $3.5 billion by a consortium that included Bain , Blackstone and NBC Universal . ) <p> As part of the deal , IBM is making some changes : First , the Weather Company 's cloud platform will now run on IBM 's Cloud data centers ( recall that it once was a big client of AWS ) . That platform will now power all of IBM 's wider push into data services and Watson 's Internet of Things business . This will bring a massively bigger amount of data into the mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> IBM will also use its weight to scale the Weather Company 's business : the company plans to expand weather.com into five more markets including China , India and Brazil "" immediately "" , as well as integrate it into IBM 's 45 global cloud centers . <p> IBM is also making an executive change : David Kenny , who had been the CEO of the Weather Company , will take on a newly-created role at IBM running the company 's wider Watson platform business . <p> The IBM acquisition will include most -- but not all -- of the Weather Company 's assets : its B2B , mobile and cloud properties ; weather.com ; Weather Underground ; The Weather Company brand ; and WSI , which houses all the company 's data science and enterprise services will all fold into Big Blue . <p> The Weather Channel -- perhaps the Weather Company 's most mainstream product -- is not included . But as part of the sale , under a long-term contract , it will license weather data forecasts and analytics now owned by IBM . <p> IBM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners -- IBM cut a deal in 2015 to tap into the Weather Company 's network of 100,000 weather sensors to ingest data for its machine-learning-based analytics services . The acquisition will now give IBM ownership of the company 's tech , and help it deliver more services around the weather vertical to current and existing IBM customers . <p> IBM also plans to build on the platform created by the Weather Company , expanding it to include other datasets . <p> "" I think the weather platform is not just about weather data , "" Kenny said in an interview today . "" Obviously we ingest more weather data than others and process it in the cloud for pilots , insurers or farmers or ordinary citizens to make better informed decisions . But that platform can be reused for other unstructured data sets ... this will be helpful for IBM in other business areas . What we have figured out at the Weather Company , and IBM will continue to explore across more IoT applications , is how to take data from lots of places and turn that into decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cited was in the area of connected cars -- an area where we have heard IBM is looking to do more business down the road . <p> The same platform that might take in weather data can now also ingest data around other automotive details around speed , or mileage , or tire pressure and other diagnostics or wider traffic conditions , to feed back information to the car companies for future products , or to the drivers or cars themselves to drive better . <p> The Weather Company 's cloud data platform already had a track record before coming to IBM : it powers the fourth most-used mobile app daily in the U.S. , IBM points out , and it handles 26 billion inquiries to its cloud-based services daily . <p> And while Internet of Things applications like this may be an obvious endpoint , they are not the only area that Kenny as the new platform head will oversee , or where Weather Company data will be used . <p> Kenny said that there are already at least 500 companies using Watson-based machine learning data , spanning applications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The idea will be to create more intelligent analytics for these groups leveraging the Weather Co. datasets . ( The proverbial Butterfly Effect made into an IT service , so to speak . ) <p> IBM more generally has making a big push to bring the company into the next generation of computing . In part , this is to help offset declines in more legacy IT services businesses . Its Global Technology Services and Global Business Services , as well as its software division , all declined in the last quarter , while cloud , mobile and analytics services all grew . <p> These newer areas are still much smaller than the legacy business , however , and IBM has seen 15 straight quarters of revenue decline . So it 's a slow , ongoing process of transformation , as CEO Ginny Rometty might say . <p> Kenny is not ruling out more acquisitions down the line . "" My goal is to make Watson a robust platform and a leader in cognitive computing .

"<h> New Dundee University biomedical unit to stop ' haemorrhaging ' of jobs -- when Tay Cities Deal is finally signed off <p> A new Dundee University project is poised to create a multi-million pound boost for the local economy -- but hinges on the Tay Cities Deal being signed off . <p> The proposed Tay Cities Biomedical Cluster , led by the university in partnership with NHS Tayside , will house life science companies , creating around 250 new jobs by 2033 . <p> Economists Value People have forecast the region will benefit in excess of ? 175 million in that time . <p> It is hoped the facility can help stop the city "" haemorrhaging "" companies . <p> The funding for the project is courtesy of the Tay Cities Deal , but the university is still waiting on the final sign off to unlock funds for the ? 25 million project . <p> The final sign off has been in limbo since the UK general election last year delayed proceedings . <p> Professor Mike Ferguson , one of the leads for the project , said : "" If the deal was signed off tomorrow , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be by November 2022 . <p> "" For every year there is a delay in bringing this to the city , we are going to lose at least one company . "" <p> Mr Ferguson says every year staff at the university see the seeds of an innovative company as students carry out research , but the lack of facilities in Dundee sees them leave to set up elsewhere in the world once they have completed their course . <p> Some examples of this are Exscientia -- a pharmatech company who have remained a presence in Dundee , but now have about half their workforce in Oxford and Osaka -- and Amphista Therapeutics , who are now based in Motherwell . <p> Mr Ferguson added : "" The problem is we are losing them in the because there is nowhere to go . <p> "" They then end up all over the world , with a lot going to Boston . <p> "" We 're hoping to stop that haemorrhaging of jobs .

"<h> Putting technology at the forefront of Bahrain 's Covid-19 fight <h> MANAMA , 16 hours , 48 minutes ago <p> As the world looks to establish a "" new normal "" amidst the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic , information and communication technologies ( ICT ) are coming to the fore in Bahrain as critical tools in protecting public health and in realising socio-economic stability , an industry expert reveals . <p> Understanding this digital shift is important to both businesses and government authorities as they seek new ways to confront the challenges posed by the pandemic , according to Cao Hongyu , CEO of Huawei Bahrain . <p> "" The reality is that everyone from healthcare providers to educators , retailers , manufacturers , and others are being affected by Covid-19 . Nearly every industry in the Kingdom is having to rethink how it does business and delivers value . That pivot requires new tools for success . Many of those are founded on digital platforms that not only enable work to be done as people are physically separated , but which enable faster , more intelligent decision making , "" he said . <p> "" Over the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important technologies that will play a role in this fight against Covid-19 . New applications of artificial intelligence ( AI ) are , for example , being used to aid the many scientists and medical experts who are searching for a vaccine and treatments . Smarter collaboration tools are assisting teachers and students across Bahrain to stay connected , and for future generations not to fall behind in today 's knowledge economy . Advanced cameras and analytics systems are helping government authorities to monitor public spaces and even conduct remote testing , protecting community wellbeing in the process , "" he added . <p> None of these scenarios would be possible without a robust ICT ecosystem . The applications of AI , cloud computing , and big data happening in the Kingdom today are proving just how valuable technology collaborations can be when done in an open framework . "" In particular , the country 's investments in 5G infrastructure are proving extremely beneficial in providing the increased bandwidth needed for the digital tools now being used in consideration of Covid-19 , "" Hongyu highlighted . <p> That open and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every sector of the economy now faces its own unique challenges and needs its own dedicated solutions . No single country or company can create all of these solutions by acting alone . <p> The fight against Covid-19 thus requires the sharing of expertise like never before , particularly in the technology field . That exchange of ideas and technologies can be seen in collaborations like those between Batelco , INJAZ and Huawei earlier this year to significantly improve wi-fi coverage and support distance learning . "" By leveraging our collective strengths and recognising the lessons learned to date , Bahrain 's ICT community can better design the systems that communities and businesses need to tackle this emergency together , "" Hongyu said . - TradeArabia News Service"

"<h> Copy/paste the article video embed link below : <p> In the run-up to Ludwig van Beethoven 's 250th birthday , a team of musicologists and programmers is using artificial intelligence to complete the composer 's unfinished tenth symphony . <p> The piece was started by Beethoven alongside his famous ninth , which includes the well-known Ode To Joy . <p> But by the time the German composer died in 1827 , there were only a few notes and drafts of the composition . <p> The experiment risks failing to do justice to the beloved German composer . Tthe team said the first few months yielded results that sounded mechanical and repetitive . <p> But now the project leader , Matthias Roeder , from the Herbert von Karajan Institute , insists the AI 's latest compositions are more promising . <p> "" An AI system learns an unbelievable amount of notes in an extremely short time , "" said Roeder . "" And the first results are a bit like with people , you say ' hmm , maybe it 's not so great ' . But it keeps going and , at some point , the system really surprises you . And that happened the first time a few weeks ago . We 're pleased that it 's making such big strides . "" <p> The group is in the process of training an algorithm that will produce a completed symphony . They 're doing this by playing snippets of Beethoven 's work and leaving the computer to improvise the rest of it . Afterwards , they correct the improvisation so it fits with the composer 's style . <p> Similar projects have been undertaken before . Schubert 's eighth symphony was finished using AI developed by Huawei . It received mixed reviews . <p> The final result of the project will be performed by a full orchestra on 28 April next year in Bonn as part of a series of celebrations of Beethoven 's work . <p> The year of celebrations begins on December 16th with the opening of his home in Bonn as a museum after renovation . <p> Euronews is no longer accessible on Internet Explorer .

"<p> Over the past decade , technology has radically changed the way businesses operate . Now , even small businesses have access to powerful tools that were previously expensive or complicated . <p> The pace of change has been rapid -- and it 's unlikely to slow down . Businesses must keep up with technology to stay competitive . According to research conducted by Citrix , 92% of companies across South Africa 's key industries agree that digital adoption directly affects company profits .

According to Xero'sState of Small Business Report produced with World Wide Worx , 49% of small businesses surveyed used ADSL connections and only 37% used fibre . When asked to describe their internet connections , 45% said they were ' great ' , while 43% said they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who said their connection was ' great ' were fibre users . <p> South Africa is still playing catch-up in terms of internet connectivity and speed . However , WiFi 6 is set to improve the way routers distribute traffic to connected devices and increase the transfer speeds by around 30% . For when you 're on the go , 5G is the next generation of mobile data standard . It 's already beingtrialed by South African carrier Rain , and a broader rollout is expected in 2020 . <p> Even if you are n't aware of it , you 're probably already using smart software which leverages machine learning ( ML ) and artificial intelligence ( AI ) in your business . While only a tiny proportion of respondents ( 0.25% ) from Xero'sState of Small Business Report say they are using them , most businesses are aware of how important they are . <p> AI and ML are great at taking large amounts of data and spotting patterns that humans might miss .

They are readily available , fairly inexpensive and , in many cases , easy to install . <p> Many are wireless , allowing one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result , they are a solution that can be customised to suit any type of security situation . <p> A world leader in doorbell security , Amazon subsidiary Ring , has recently extended its range of security devices , which now includes doorbells , floodlights , and Wi-Fi extenders , all designed to enhance and complement existing security beams and electric fences . <p> First up is the Ring Video DoorBell 2 <p> It does n't look much like your normal intercom system , except for the miniature eye that keeps track of mischief that may be happening . <p> Setting up is fairly easy . All one needs to do is connect it to the network by pushing the connect button , create an account on the downloaded smartphone app and get started with customisation and certification . Features like sensitivity , alerts , and numbers where these alerts need to be sent can all be preprogrammed . It is then just a matter of positioning the doorbell to get the best video coverage . <p> Getting the correct position may take some time , though , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up is the Floodlight Cam <p> This works much the same as the doorbell . However , it needs to be mounted to a wall . Ring has you covered there : in the box you will find drill bits , screws and even a screwdriver to help you secure the camera . <p> You will have to set alerts , phone numbers , and sensitivity . The spotlight allows you to change what time it should light up and shut down , and the package also includes an alarm , should its beams be broken . <p> Although this all sounds good , there are a few drawbacks to the Ring solutions . Firstly , unlike the United States , where doorbells are stuck in the vicinity of a front door , allowing them to connect to a network easily , many houses in South Africa have gates that need to be opened before one can reach the front door . This means that the bells are on or near the gate , and they are unable to connect to a home or business network . <p> Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this requires an additional set-up process -- and a fairly expensive one , considering the camera cost . <p> The Ring devices come with Protection Plans that automatically upload any triggered recordings to the cloud , allowing you to view them at a later stage . This trial period only lasts for 30 days , after which the plans can be extended from R450 for a three month period , up to R1 500 for a twelve-month period . <p> In practice <p> The attention to detail in the packaging and the addition of the tools really does put the Ring in a class of its own . No short cuts were taken in its design , and you can immediately see that it 's no rip-off . However , the Protection Plans need to be looked at carefully in terms of their costs . <p> Aside from this challenge , I found the devices very handy inside my house . For instance , a few times my external alarm or fence would sound , at which stage I would get a notification from my armed response -- while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my phone to check if anything strange was happening -- all in a matter of seconds and while I was sitting all the way in Berlin . <p> The devices are rather expensive , though , with the Video Door Bell starting at R3 500 and going up to R7 990 , and the Floodlight Cam going for R5 000 . It all adds up quickly . <p> The cost means these solutions may not be quite ready for the South African consumer looking for a complete external perimeter security system . <p> Despite the Protection Plans , I did find them very handy inside my house . For instance , a few times my external alarm or fence would sound , at which stage I would get a notification from my armed response . <p> But , I easily logged in to Ring from my phone to check if anything strange was happening -- all in a matter of seconds and while I was sitting all the way in Berlin . <h> It 's not a ' techlash ' -- it 's a ' tech clash ' <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Published <p> 7 hours ago <p> on <p> February 26 , 2020 <p> People 's love for technology has let businesses weave it , and themselves , into our lives , transforming how we work live and interact in this new world which we at Accenture are referring to -- in our Tech Vision 2020 -- as the "" post-digital era . "" But now we are being held back . <p> At a time when people see the potential of embracing technology more deeply into their lives , systems and services built for a old era are not supporting where people want to go . The next five years will see radical transformation as technology is realigned to better reflect people 's needs and values . <p> We look at the latest emerging trends that will transform how we live in work in this fundamentally different post-digital world .

Until now , enterprises have been using AI to automate parts of their workflows , but as AI capabilities grow , following the old path will limit the full benefit of AI investments , potentially marginalise people , and cap businesses ' ability for growth . Businesses must rethink the work they do to make AI a generative part of the process .

"<h> Industry gears up for tech 's era of democratisation <h> Businesses not plugged into technology 's network are left by the wayside , say company leaders and analysts <p> Analysts say in 2016 and beyond , wearable devices will offer a wide range of new opportunities to engage customers and employees , and will create innovative experiences and digital business offerings . But they add wearables will be far more than just smartwatches . <p> SPH FILE PHOTO <p> Dec 30 , 2015 5:50 AM <p> Singapore <p> AS we pass the halfway mark of the second decade of the new millennium , all organisations , big and small , are grappling with the fact that technology has become the central nervous system of global commerce and communication . Any organisation which is not plugged into this network is brutally left by the wayside . This applied to every company , irrespective of the industry or size , throughout 2015 and would do so for the foreseeable future , according to a slew of company leaders and analysts that The Business Times talked to . <p> Ajay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software used in multiple industries , notes that as 2015 ends , every industry is facing disruption and a degree of democratisation . Explaining the "" democratisation "" , Mr Advani adds : "" The confluence of hardware , software and materials - with innovation in all three areas happening simultaneously - along with the connectedness of people , changes the rules of the game . Now anybody can take down a titan . "" <p> Simon Tate , who is Salesforce 's area VP for commercial business - Asia , agrees . He observes that the new year looks set to be one of change , not just in the technology sector but in every industry , with technology embedded in everything we do . Salesforce is one of the world 's top cloud computing companies . <p> "" The rise of mobile and social technologies has made end-users more empowered and knowledgeable than ever before . At the same time , organisations of all sizes can leverage the cloud to make faster , more efficient software changes ; use social media to connect with customers ; deploy predictive analytics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control devices via a central point with the Internet of Things ( IoT ) , "" he adds . <p> Sam Liew , managing director and Asean technology lead at Accenture , a leading global professional services company , observes that we are likely to witness four key technology trends : <p> Increased automation via artificial intelligence ( AI ) , which will help to drive innovation in our daily lives and platforms will start to become "" more intelligent "" ; <p> integrated technology platform ecosystems , as the lines between ( different ) technology platforms blur even further with overlaps between domains ; <p> gamification ( which is the the application of typical elements of "" game playing "" in areas such as online marketing ) and digital behaviour-shaping tools that engage employees , helping them track progress towards objectives , build new skills and create a portfolio of achievements ; and <p> a "" liquid "" workforce ( which is using freelancers , often crowdsourcing for skills , instead of hiring regular full-time employees ) , which aims to bring together social networks and online portal extensions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology that is changing the way organisations think and to stay relevant and agile is the "" As-a-Service "" model . <p> Accenture research has shown that the "" As-a-Service "" model offers numerous advantages , including the use of plug-in , scalable , consumption-based services supported by analytics , cloud and automation . <p> That said , organisations need to be bold in experimenting and implementing new technologies , adds Mr Liew . Organisations need to be more agile and flexible in order for them to adapt new disruptive technologies ; it is also critical to learn from mistakes when implementing new technologies , and continue finetuning processes and structures , says Mr Liew . <p> Salesforce 's Mr Tate observes that in order to overcome the challenges of increased competition , companies need to invest in creating personalised customer journeys derived through customer insights , and the answer to this can be found through relationship intelligence . <p> Relationship intelligence , which refers to information that salespeople and other stakeholders can garner about the history of their company 's relationship with a prospective customer , has become a trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales tool in 2016 and beyond . <p> Mr Tate adds that in 2015 , consumers connect with brands through a myriad of ways - be it in store , forums , or on social media , through both official and unofficial channels . Every single brand touch point that the consumer encounters plays a role in shaping their perception of the brand in their decision-making process . As the number of touch points increases and consumer expectations rise , brands often find themselves stretched to fulfil multiple requests concurrently . <p> "" In 2016 those businesses that are able to meet the customer in all those places and exceed their expectations will be the companies that succeed . <p> "" More than ever before , organisations of every size and industry are looking for solutions to transform how they work and engage with customers to drive growth . This year ( 2015 ) may have been the year of buzzwords like IoT and wearables - but 2016 looks set to be the year when the discussion moves towards transformational technologies centred on the customer , "" he adds . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Apac president of data management and cloud solutions provider NetApp , says that 2015 saw a significant increase in the adoption of connected personal devices such as smartphones and "" wearables "" . Fitness monitoring , automotive safety , holiday planning and even lower insurance rates are some of the convenient features that people are anticipating from IoT which is makes the "" wearables "" ecosystem work . Businesses are using these new technologies to deliver new experiences and value-add offers to customers . <p> "" As the amount and complexity of data that 's available at our fingertips grows through IoT 's implementation , it becomes important to find a better way to store , manage and retrieve data . IoT is , in effect , artificial intelligence with data as the cardiovascular system that keeps it alive . Therefore , organisations are looking at how they leverage and maximise advancing technologies which help to manage data to become more agile and responsive , "" Mr Scurfield adds . <p> Analysts observe that "" wearables "" became mainstream in 2015 , thanks to devices such as the Apple Watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide range of new opportunities to engage customers and employees and will create innovative experiences and digital business offerings , but wearables will be far more than just smartwatches . "" The wearable market will evolve very rapidly ; organisations developing applications involving wearables must be extremely agile and flexible , "" says Gartner Research 's principle research analyst , Adrian Leow . <p> Researchers and product developers are working on a vast range of new wearable devices , such as the smart fingernail , the wearable "" selfie drone "" , smart contact lenses , and subcutaneous sensors . <p> "" In the longer term , some wearables will evolve from passive sensing and display functions to more active roles such as sartorial robotics . We also expect wearable technologies to evolve rapidly to enable new types of wearables and deliver improved features in established categories such as smartwatches . Areas of technology evolution include touch-sensitive fabrics , new types of screen technologies , improved batteries and printable electronics , "" Mr Leow observes . <p> The Gartner analyst adds that in 2016 , the number of enterprise mobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision for the digital workplace and a robust mobile strategy will thrive , and those without will struggle . <p> "" Consumers make mobility-related decisions in a split second , based on the appeal of an icon , screenshots or a half-star-higher rating ; mobile offerings with superior user experiences rise to the top , "" he adds . <p> Ryan Goh , VP and GM of Zebra Technologies , a major IoT player , adds that his company is anticipating that Wi-Fi will be one of the most important technologies enabling IoT implementations , as businesses experience greater pressure on their systems due to new devices and services coming online . <p> A powerful , secure wireless infrastructure will be the basis for seamless connectivity , and the glue that brings together the power of IoT-enabled devices for seamless , simplified operations for the enterprises . <p> "" As Singapore evolves in its Smart Nation journey , organisations will increasingly seek to gain a good handle and full picture of their business operations . <p> "" Having a holistic strategy would enable them to make the most out of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data capture , to sense , analyse and act on data . 2016 will be an exciting time for our industry to seize opportunities in an IoT-ready landscape , "" Mr Goh adds ."
"<h> Over 20 proposals for new national car received -- MITI <p> The news headlines may have moved on , but the new national car project ( NNCP ) is rolling on behind the scenes . According to the deputy minister of international trade and industry ( MITI ) , Dr Ong Kian Ming , his ministry has received over 20 proposals for the project , which was raised by prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad . <p> "" In terms of the ( new ) national car , we 've received more than 20 proposals to date , from individuals , the private sector and GLC companies . We have a matrix in which we analyse and evaluate each of these proposals . This would be part and parcel of the consultative process by which we come out with a much more comprehensive approach towards this third national car and how it would look like , "" Ong said on BFM 89.9 's Breakfast Grille show this morning . <p> He reiterated that the government wo n't be using public funds for the NNCP , which has to be financially sustainable . "" I think what we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen that in the 2019 Budget , there 's been no commitment made by the government in terms of funding the third national car project . So , whatever proposal that comes in from the various companies will have to include serious financial proposals to make this viable . "" <p> MITI is in the process of reviewing the National Automotive Policy ( NAP ) , and Ong insists that the ministry is looking at a larger picture of the entire automotive ecosystem , and is n't just focused on the NNCP . <p> "" I think we should not discuss the thrd national car project in isolation , beacuse what 's most important is the whole automotive sector . My ministry is currrently undergoing a review process of the NAP . The last review was done in 2014 and the next one is due early next year . <p> "" What this entails is to look at the entire automotive ecosystem . It includes for example the other CKD players ; other car players such as Perodua ; the vendors that supply the CKD players , Proton and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues , "" he said . <p> Elaborating on the final point above , he added : "" If we want to introduce more hybrids and electric vehicles , we 're talking bout batteries , we 're talking about charging stations , electric motorcycles and bicycles . The bigger picture would be looking at the larger automotive sector . "" <p> To recap , last month , entrepreneur development minister Datuk Seri Mohd Redzuan Yusof announced the timelines for the NNCP -- the new national car 's name will be announced by the end of this year , while the prototype for the NNCP model is expected to be ready by early next year , ahead of a 2020 roll out . The car is expected to feature semi-autonomous capabilities and advanced safety features , while remaining affordable . <p> Danny Tan loves driving as much as he loves a certain herbal meat soup , and sweet engine music as much as drum beats . He has been in the auto industry since 2006 , previously filling the pages of two motoring magazines before joining this website . Enjoys detailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reiterated that the government wo n't be using public funds for the NNCP , which has to be financially sustainable . "" I think what we 're looking for are proposals which are financially sustainable . You 've seen that in the 2019 Budget , there 's been no commitment made by the government in terms of funding the third national car project . So , whatever proposal that comes in from the various companies will have to include serious financial proposals to make this viable . "" <p> In other words , the cronies have lined up early and had been chosen . All these "" proposals "" r just wayang to tipu the easily fooled pipu . The previous Gov have managed to offload the countrys burden and ensure the survival of national car , but now we go back one again to carrying this burden once more . So those who chose PH , stop complaining about car prices cuz u made that choice to choose overpriced Perotiga . <p> Even for ' cronies ' as you said , they need to work hard in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just tipu , you need a team of engineers and designers working together . This is what Proton should have done instead of rebadging China cars . Also , stop blaming the Gov for cars you ca n't afford as the previous Gov have never managed to make cars affordable to ensure the survival of national car . <p> Many people blame on national car 3.0 but they fail to see the reason behind this project and solely blame on Tun M is desire to attain his dream . In fact we have NO CHOICE because we are heavily rely on automotive . There are a lot of people in automotive industry like car manufacturer , transportation , used cars ( online market or showroom ) , grab car , tyre shops , car repair or service center , body paint , car accessories , car tinting , car wash , carpark , public ticket machine ( oen of the income to local municipal ) and many more . Imagine one day we have zero car ( except public buses ) on the road and people all take train , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income too . By then who need the public buses or trains as no work available . <p> Some of you may said we can explore more fields like IT , machinery technology , medication research , telco etc . But we are not in these fields in the past and there are other countries are very good in these fields . It takes decades to them to become expert and invested huge amount of money involved and trained or employed many talents to become successful in these fields . <p> If we start explore new things government need to invest huge amount of money but now we all know the country is in huge debt . We need outsider to invest money into Malaysia . You guys may argue we have lots of natural resources and should be fully utilize , but if we local Malaysia unable to havest and utilize them then these resources are considered as junk . Why do nt we allow foreigner companies to utilize these resources and return some profit to us . <p> The main reason of this national car 3.0 is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create 175k jobs and over 100 of enterpreneurs . This figure may not real but if the achieve half it will still about 90k people got jobs to survive . <p> Every year we heard of news some big companies reduce workforce , companies like Western Digital , Seagate , British Tobacco , Japan Tobacco . These are reported one but there are many not reported one like IT companies IBM , HP , Dell etc every year they also retrench staffs more than new employment . In year 2015 38,000 jobs lost , 2016 about 37,000 jobs gone as official mentioned . 2017 unofficial report is about 40,000 jobs retrenched and 2018 is expected to be 50,000 jobs lost . <p> Now you tell me which field or industry can help to employ these people , let said 30% still unemployed about 50,000 . Do n't forget there are more and more youngesters to come out to work , they do need job too . And soon more and more insurance agents and bankers will lost their jobs too if artificial intelligence take over . <p> To me this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is more for creating job to citizens . <p> Actually I 've no idea what you r implying on creating another National Car to boost up car accessories/parts suppliers in Malaysia . Does n't Malaysia have enough 3rd party brands to support them why do you even need another car company ? <p> Malaysia is never a car manufacturer to begin with , we are basically not capable to create a car from the ground up because in our Schooling days there is no such automotive subject to begin with while our higher education on this subject is also limited as can be seen all our national engines are manufactured with other partners or just bolted on by other brands . <p> To be real honest why Malaysian are so mad is all because this car parts/accessories suppliers were created to lower down the quality ( as quoted by Proton ) and to feed some cronies along the way . <p> Do you think Malaysia citizens still living in 1990 ? We are getting more educated and people wo n't buy low quality products these days . To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had owned 1 saga , 2 iswara , 3 wira , 2 waja , 1 perdana and 1 Gen 2 in past 20 years . Except the mighty Gen2 was giving most headache other proton models are not bad . I have none of these cars broken down in roadside except Gen2 . Waja ( both mitsubishi engine models ) has no issue on engine or gearbox except the absorber problem . Wira proton is well know as the power window , broken 2-3 times during 7 years time . Saga and Iswara are great not giving headache except no powersteering ( need more muscle power to turn ) . <p> To me worst part of Proton is the after sales service , the SC does n't has skilled workers , waiting long time for parts , lower standard of SC somes are authorize workshop deemed as SC and higher bill . <p> Nowadays no more cronies companies for Proton after Preve launched if not mistaken . Because my friend worked in steel supply company to Proton and the steel was imported from Korea it was from Hyundai steel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Robert Bosch . Is this also call crony ? <p> Why proton ca n't lower down the price is because they are unable to achieve economy of scale like others . If the sales of Proton is low the cost of production will be higher . To achieve lower cost they must produce more and sell not only domestic but also overseas markets . <p> Malaysia has a lot of small car accessories shops or spare part shops but this is for "" replacement market "" . We do not have enough BIG part supppliers in Malaysia yet as the current scale is still consider small . FYI , Proton tanjung malim plant is still under utilized until today . To boost the scale of parts suppliers they need big order from car manufacturer , that 's why more CKD cars or national cars will help them expand their capacity and business too . No volume will lead to higher cost , less competitive and lower margin . We are talking about business without volume business is hard to sustain . <p> National car 3.0 reduce the country 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all car manufacturers including national car have to pay this excise duty tax . Tax incentive apply to corporate tax once a year but excise duty charge on EVERY new vehicle sold . So there is no revenue decrease but increase of excise duty tax income to government . <p> P1 still designing bumpers and logo after 30 years .. screw all those claiming need protect engineers and related industries job .. they can easily find job without neeer for national car status .. just look at Thailand <p> I would like to express one thing . How good is our Malaysian driver , road infrastructure , public transport and etc . If you could solved those issues and raise your voice for third national car . I salute u . Those ambition to have another car company is not bad , but please fix our citizens of Malaysia main point . Even third national car will be intro , how much tax being impose into import cars . U want all Malaysian to suffer . Hope G feel our pain . Malaysian is suffering with high tax into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market and let P1 and P2 become mature without protection . I feel bad for Malaysian who suffer since day one P1 exist . <p> I hope government not increase the import or excise duty anymore to foreign car brands , meanwhile please DO NOT reduce excise duty too . Imagine with current high tax on vehicle luxury brand like Mercedes and BMW are selling more new vehicle every year . This imply that Malaysian have high capability to afford expensive car . Look at the road condition in KL , the traffic is getting higher every year despite more highways built . <p> If decrease of car tax means government encourage more citizens to buy car and our traffic will get worsening . National car 3.0 is creating additonal option to citizens rather than to encourage citizen to buy more cars . It is increase of OPTION not volume . <p> I was told by one of my contacts that Kepong kit car makers Bufori also submitted for national car . they cant even save themselves and make proper cars and they bid for this ? is this an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thailand Bangkok , Philippines Manila or Indonesia Jakarta ? Look at these countries with no vehicle tax or very low tax rate , the traffic condition is extremely horrible . 5km distance will take at least 30-45min in day time non-peak hour . <p> And yet with higher car tax rate in ASEAN except lower than Singapore , Malaysia has the highest ratio of branded cars . Our cars are expensive and yet we still afford to buy expensive foreign cars , what if government reduce the tax people will buy even more expensive or additional cars to flood the road . <p> And this national car 3.0 intention is to create job opportunity , I did not seen a reason to oppose it unless you can tell me which single industry nowadays can give 175k job opportunity . <p> Country like Vietnam just launched their national car WINFAST and being featured in the Paris Auto Show . The EV cars look really attractive . If Vietnam can do it we Malaysians can do it too . We should encourage the 3rd car development initiatives n work to succeed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , designing , financial control , sales n marketing n technical training are utmost important to make the 3rd car project n it 's brand successfull otherwise we Malaysians will become a laughing stock . Make it the pride of all Malaysians . <p> If you guys realise I did reply several posts here . Why I so keen to do so , I am not related to PH nor involve in politic . My point of view purely from economy perspective . Nowadays more and more industries reducing workforce and many retrenchment happened and people are losing their jobs . This is not only happen to Malaysia but also globally . There will be more retrenchment happen in future not because of Malaysia government not good but due to cost effectiveness and advance technology lead to automation . <p> There are no single industry can create more jobs in near future except this national car 3.0 project . It is true having new national car is not a good idea to settle our daily commuting issue . But this project gives lots of career opportunity and more businesses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created means more personal income tax collect , more business means government able to collect more corporate income tax . And yet this project is not using public fund , it is 100% private project . In this scenario government does not spend money to create more jobs and business opportunities and yet they able to collect more excise duty from new national car 3.0 and more income tax ( personal and corporate ) . This is huge income to government to pay off the country debt . <p> You can either post as a guest or have an option to register .

"<h> Combination of techniques could improve security for IoT devices <p> UNIVERSITY PARK , Pa. -- A multi-pronged data analysis approach that can strengthen the security of Internet of Things ( IoT ) devices -- such as smart TVs , home video cameras and baby monitors -- against current risks and threats has created by a team of Penn State World Campus students pursuing master of professional studies degrees in information sciences . <p> "" By 2020 , more than 20 billion IoT devices will be in operation , and these devices can leave people vulnerable to security breaches that can put their personal data at risk or worse , affect their safety , "" said Beulah Samuel , a student in the Penn State World Campus information sciences and technology program . "" Yet no strategy exists to identify when and where a network security attack on these devices is taking place and what such an attack even looks like . "" <p> The team applied a combination of approaches often used in traditional network security management to an IoT network simulated by the University of New South Wales Canberra . Specifically , they showed how statistical data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied to assure the security of IoT systems across their lifecycle . They then used intrusion detection and a visualization tool , to determine whether or not an attack had already occurred or was in progress within that network . <p> The researchers describe their approach and findings in a paper to be presented today ( Oct. 10 ) at the 2019 IEEE Ubiquitous Computing , Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference . The team received the "" Best Paper "" award for their work . <p> One of the data analysis techniques the team applied was the open-source freely available R statistical suite , which they used to characterize the IoT systems in use on the Canberra network . In addition , they used machine learning solutions to search for patterns in the data that were not apparent using R. <p> "" One of the challenges in maintaining security for IoT networks is simply identifying all the devices that are operating on the network , "" said John Haller , a student in the Penn State World Campus information sciences and technology program . "" Statistical programs , like R @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The researchers used the widely available Splunk intrusion detection tool , which comprises software for searching , monitoring and analyzing network traffic , via a Web-style interface . <p> "" Splunk is an analytical tool that is often used in traditional network traffic monitoring , but had only seen limited application to IoT traffic , until now , "" said Melanie Seekins . <p> Using these tools , and others , the team identified three IP addresses that were actively trying to break into the Canberra network 's devices . <p> "" We observed three IP addresses attempting to attach to the IoT devices multiple times over a period of time using different protocols , "" said Andrew Brandon . "" This clearly indicates a Distributed Denial of Service attack , which aims to disrupt and/or render devices unavailable to the owners . "" <p> As the basis for their approach , the researchers compared it to a common framework used to help manage risk , the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) Risk Management Framework ( RMF ) . <p> "" The NIST RMF was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framework that organizations can use to tailor , test , and monitor implemented security controls .

"<h> Here 's how India is working towards the future of AI and machine learning <p> Amid the realignment of jobs and changing business models , companies are aligning goals with the world in a quest for a global AInetwork . <p> Key highlights : <p> Next decade will push Narrow AI to "" real AI "" <p> IT services businesses will bet more on software <p> Startups will play a key role in corporate innovation in AI <p> Realignment of the workforce amidst much chaos <p> AI will remove mundane tasks such as customer engagements at initial stage <p> Data processing power of GPUs and massive storage to lead the era of deep learning and machine learning <p> This autumn or post-monsoon , depending on which part of the world you live in , the movie Blade Runner will see a return after 35 years . If you remember the first movie , the artificial intelligence character , or the "" replicant "" , the antagonist , played by Rutger Hauer , saves the protagonist , played by Harrison Ford , from dying . After that , the protagonist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford then says : "" I do n't know why he saved my life . Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before . Not just his life , anybody 's life , my life . All he 'd wanted were the same answers the rest of us want . Where did I come from ? Where am I going ? How long have I got ? All I could do was sit there and watch him die . "" <p> That 's AI for you in a nutshell when things become sentient . Computer programmers call it "" singularity "" , where self-learning software would become aware with every cycle of learning and ultimately surpass human intelligence . <p> Rolf Bulander , Chairman of Mobility Services , Bosch GmbH , says "" New technologies such as AI and ML have already ushered in the era of making networks intelligent and are changing business models . "" He adds that in Germany they have already created an ethics committee to understand the man-and-machine relationship in case of automated driving . <p> "" Fundamental questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , a child or the parent . The setting up of the committee clearly signals that human intelligence and machine intelligence should work together , "" Rolf says . <p> Before we have robots taking over the world , serious work is being done in every industry to get tasks done by software and remove human intervention altogether . <p> Machines are not sentient yet , but we are already in the realm of "" Narrow AI "" , where mundane tasks such as customer queries and data generation will not need humans anymore . <h> The world of Narrow AI <p> Starting from healthcare and banking to automotive and media , business models are changing thanks to Narrow AI . The languages , mostly Python and even Java , going into AI and ML are all built out of India , which is why the country is aligning its goals to the world 's quest for a global network of artificial intelligence . <p> The terms ML and AI are used interchangeably these days . But what are they really ? <p> NVIDIA , the $4.5 billion GPU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in AI today can be termed "" Narrow AI "" , where certain tasks are better performed by technology . So before we have a sentient being ( like in Blade Runner ) , we are already in the era of "" Narrow AI "" . The bot example was one of them because they use millions of data points that are processed quickly and present immediate action . <p> Machine Learning , on the other hand , is termed as an approach to AI . It is nothing but algorithms that make sense of data to determine or predict something , thanks to the processing power of chips today . Before Machine Learning comes something known as Deep Learning where engineers try to understand the functions of the brain and how neurons work . So while programming , engineers look at how a machine can function like neurons firing in the brain to perform tasks . <p> Layak Singh , Co-founder of Artivatic , says : "" Engineers today can make a machine understand text , video and images . But every engine needs to be trained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building a system for banks to understand credit history of customers and reduce loan defaults . <p> Startups are clearly playing a major role in innovating faster than corporates , which has led to several curious partnerships . SAP India has invested in Niki.ai , a bot that improves the ordering experience . Then there 's Ractrack.AI , where a bot improves customer engagement and provides insights ; it functions as a virtual communications assistant to convert the customer into a client . Racetrack is helping companies turn leads into meaningful engagements by using AI . Another startup , LUCEP , converts all potential queries into leads with their AI engine . <p> Bobby Reddy , of Indus Ventures , is the Co-founder of Housingman.com , which is building a platform that uses machine learning and artificial intelligence . "" The objective is to generate insights from data and simplify customer interaction with a business and also convert them into leads , "" he says . <p> Indian startups saw $4 billion in risk capital being deployed across 1,040 angel and VC/PE deals between January and December 2016 . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreased value of 55 percent from the same period last year ( 2015 ) and a decrease of 20 percent from 2014 . About $9 billion in VC/PE capital had been invested in 2015 . The number of deals in 2016 , however , has increased by 3 percent over the last year . On an average , four startup deals were announced every weekday throughout 2016 . VCs predict that going forward machine learning and AI would be key themes to invest in . <h> The era of voice and vision <p> Billions of dollars have been pouring into AI across the world . <p> Leaders like Elon Musk , the founder of Tesla , have said this will create a global apocalypse and should be "" regulated "" . He expressed this fear because Russian President Vladimir Putin said the race to own AI assets will determine the ruler of the world . Musk also expresses that a system of such intelligence could "" start a global war "" . <p> One must really watch Westworld or read Issac Asimov to understand the merits and consequences of AI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , "" We are in a great era of change because human behaviour will be out-matched by superior digital technologies . AI will eventually change everything . But humans can do better things than mundane tasks . "" <p> In Manthan 's offices , engineers and marketing teams are jointly working together to build a voice-based AI suite called "" Maya "" , based on Amazon 's Alexa platform . Maya , when called upon , becomes the virtual assistant to the CEO and dynamically pulls out company sales information across regions . She can even tell what categories did not sell . <p> "" Over time the platform can prescribe what should be done and this will challenge the entire C-Suite of leaders , "" Atul says . <p> The impact of AI is best described in a PwC report on The Future of Work : A Journey Towards 2022 . This predicts that a student protest will erupt globally in 2020 as a consequence of the non-availability of jobs . This prognosis is based on universities not being able to keep pace with sudden changes in economy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs and the accompanying chaos , companies will push the boundaries of innovation in AI . It will all be about agile IT , sensors , and data , which will change the entire Indian work scenario . Coding jobs will be scarce as all platforms will be available and automated . IT and its allied services will focus on implementing products such as SAP , Microsoft and Oracle on platforms in cloud environments . <p> Vishal Sikka , the outgoing CEO of Infosys , said the future of Indian IT was not in services , but in software . He was prescient as all global clients want IT to be enabled to business outcomes and building agile applications . <p> This year , Infosys launched Nia , its AI platform . Nia worked as a PoC in a bank which generated data volume of 596 million trade transactions on a 100-node cluster in the AWS stack . The case was peculiar and it involved pulling data rapidly to avoid fines in reporting . Usually the message insertion rate into a platform is slow ; it takes more than 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per second or 18.22 MB per second . <p> The report execution for 30,000 trade records was done in 35 seconds , with corresponding 120,000 trade line items , including end-to-end processing . If the bank reports delays of more than 15 minutes , it attracts a penalty by the regulator . With the Nia platform , end-to-end processing and reporting just took 35 seconds instead of 10-15 minutes . The platform helped the bank avoid non-compliance and related penalties . <p> Again , all this is just "" Narrow AI "" . <p> Undoubtedly Nandan Nilekani , who ushered in the Aadhar database in this country , will understand the use of AI in processing data . It has a bright future as an investment opportunity , provided CIOs take the plunge in using AI in their companies to reap benefits . <h> The future : reducing human error <p> According to Gartner , by 2018 Indian CIOs are expected to spend around a third of their IT budgets on the digital economy . Analytics , cloud services , mobility and digitalisation/digital marketing are the top four spending priorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Globally , spending on digitalisation is expected to jump to 28 percent of IT budgets by 2018 from 19 percent in early 2017 . <p> No wonder Google 's AlphaGo , IBM Watson and Bosch Centre for Artificial Intelligence are approaching this subject with so much fervour . Their platforms will power homes , cars and industry . <p> Bosch is already working with Daimler to launch an autonomous car in the early part of the next decade . It is training a whole range of cars to use computer vision , LIDAR , Radar and Ultrasound to figure out driving autonomously . Nearly 3,000 engineers from Bosch , in Stuttgart and Bengaluru , have one thing in common : they are putting their brains -- figuratively speaking -- into a super brain . This "" brain "" can crunch 30 trillion data points per second and will process data three times faster than a human brain can . This "" brain "" , powered by AI , has no reason to feel guilty about anything because it is designed to not make mistakes . <p> In one year since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 1 billion from the sale of these sensors with an order book value of ? 3.5 billion . This is significant because with Elon Musk 's Tesla paving the way for a world where software in the car will determine the travel experience , a vehicle is no longer going to be a single entity . It is going to understand everything , be it the driving methods or shopping habits of a person . <p> Dirk Hoheisel , member of the board of management , Robert Bosch GmbH , says , "" Only AI will make this possible and reduce human error . "" <p> He adds that an AI-led car has superior reflexes compared to human beings . It can interpret if there is a ball or a child on the road . <p> "" We have to improve our sensors to monitor surroundings and think like humans , but only faster , "" Dirk says . <p> Is this the era of AI ? 2017-2018 is about this narrative .

It 's a tidy stretch of Yonge , the object of some care and investment to reflect the area around it -- prosperous suburbs anchored around a historic village . It 's not the sort of place you associate with homelessness , but that 's why the Krasman is here . <p> The Krasman Centre is 20 years old ; it began life as a resource centre and evolved into a drop-in to give aid to the homeless in the area , many of them with mental health issues . It became a United Way agency recently , which is what 's brought Daniele Zanotti , president and CEO of United Way Greater Toronto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zanotti , president and CEO of United Way Greater Toronto , listens to Lisa Kostakis , executive director of Albion Neighbourhood Services in Rexdale , discuss how local gangs have tried to use the centre to recruit . ( Rick McGinnis / for the Toronto Star ) <p> Stephen Bambo , seated , previews his website and clothing designs to Daniele Zanotti and Lisa Kostakis , both at right , at the REXpressions media arts program at Albion Neighbourhood Services . ( Rick McGinnis / for the Toronto Star ) <p> The front room is full when we arrive , with clients doing crafts and drinking coffee . There 's no diagnosis needed to access the Krasman 's services , such as computers , telephones , food , washrooms and a shower . Many of the staff have also had experience with mental health issues , and a third of them started as users of programs at the Krasman . <p> Zanotti is met by Susan Dobson , executive director at the Krasman , who introduces us to workers and clients and makes sure everyone is OK with having their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lounge at the back . Everyone is friendly , none more so than a cheerful man with an impressive collection of facial tattoos . <p> "" What we like to see here most is people supporting each other , "" Zanotti says . Dobson tells us they deal with all kinds of crises in the lives of their clients , such as loneliness and isolation , or the grieving widow who did n't have anywhere else to go for sympathy . What surprises many people about the Krasman is that a centre for mental health and homelessness is needed here , so far from downtown . <p> Article Continued Below <p> When the Toronto United Way merged with its two adjacent agencies in York and Peel regions recently , it was an acknowledgment that issues such as homelessness , mental health , youth unemployment and simple poverty had migrated not only into working-class suburbs but into neighbourhoods like Richmond Hill , which seemed prosperous and immune . <p> "" In York Region there were no low-income neighbourhoods in the 1980s , today about 16 per cent are low income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most dramatic increase , about 52 per cent of neighbourhoods are low income . "" <p> Dobson explains that even working at capacity , they can only do so much work out of the drop-in centre , even with its central location on transit lines . The Krasman serves a large area , and there 's a need for mobile workers who can go and meet with clients in the field , at libraries and coffee shops . <p> The vastness of the area United Way agencies have to cover is underlined when Zanotti heads for his next stop , in Peel Region , at an after-school program at the Erin Mills Youth Centre . We 're met there by Adoama Patterson , an adviser with the Peel Poverty Reduction Strategy Committee that 's co-chaired by the United Way . <p> The centre is run out of a suite of rooms on the ground floor of a public housing complex , in an area that features the usual suburban landmarks : a Costco and a Home Depot , a Mandarin , some auto dealerships and an arena . Patterson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Winnipeg was in another lowrise apartment just next door . <p> Workers and volunteers have started laying Halloween crafts out on the tables in the big room , and a few children have already showed up . One little boy is an obvious favourite of the staff , and effortlessly makes himself the centre of attention . He tells us he wants to be a YouTube star and drive a Ferrari . <p> Patterson says the hard part of managing programs out here is the rate of change . There 's the transience expected from their client families , who move to where jobs and rental accommodation can be found . But there are also demographic changes that have to be managed as newcomers alter the makeup of communities , and big economic changes , such as artificial intelligence , automation and the "" gig economy "" hit low-income workers first and hardest . <p> Article Continued Below <p> To address this , Patterson 's group has instituted an unprecedented 10-year plan for their region -- the first in Canada , and unheard of in social services , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups are willing to plan . She says it 's actually the best way to manage poverty issues that they consider their focus ; there are areas they can predict changing rapidly over the next decade , such as Brampton , but the longer time frame lets them stay on top of those big-picture issues . <p> "" Ten years allows us to keep in control of the things that will change slowly , "" she says . <p> Another drive along the highway takes us to Rexdale , where Zanotti got his start in social work , and to Albion Neighbourhood Services . It 's one of the United Way 's "" anchor agencies "" -- a hub , built in what was once a Catholic high school and home to multiple services and agencies , such as a Boys and Girls Club . <p> Executive director Lisa Kostakis meets us . Like most people who run social service agencies , she has a big personality ; she 's known Zanotti for a long time , and they playfully tease each other while she shows us around the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of former classrooms . <p> The priority at ANS is youth employment , and Kostakis quickly runs through a number of recent programs , such as the youth job fair they recently sponsored at Woodbine Casino . The United Way 's corporate partnerships are essential to these programs , which help steer young people toward them as future employers ; Kostakis mentions nearby Toronto Pearson International Airport offering internships to young people in their programs . <p> She takes us to the home of REXpressions -- a media arts program based out of the centre , where local kids are given access to the equipment needed to edit photos , mix music and design websites . Mentorships are key to the program , and we watch a young man , Stephen Bambo , as he 's given help designing a website for a clothing line he 's designed . <p> Kostakis says they 're competing for the kids ' attention with the local gangs , who 've been known to try and use the centre to try and recruit before they 've been banned . She says the hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want , and they 're tired of it . "" We 've been doing that to them for years . "" What 's needed is to provide options and resources . <p> "" There 's no app for human care , "" Zanotti says . "" We 've got to come to a deep understanding that we all have a role to play . It is literally our brother , mother or friend , on any of the issues and unless we commit to it and lean in on community and local issues , we are n't going to solve this stuff .

"<h> Read Next <p> Turing awardee Yann LeCun unintentionally sparked up a debate on the role of bias in machine learning with a single tweet . A paper called PULSE made the rounds last week , thanks to the CVPR conference . It was used to demonstrate how a machine learning model could generate a high-quality realistic face when it is given a pixelated input . However , things went out of hand when few enthusiasts started playing with the model . <p> When a blurred image of Barack Obama was fed to the model , it blurted out an image of a Caucasian male . Given the situation right now in the US , it did n't take long for the people to come down heavy on the lack of diversity in ML results . The issue of racial and gender bias has been around for a while , and no one seems to know the solution to it so far . <p> I 'm sick of this framing . Tired of it . Many people have tried to explain , many scholars . Listen to us . You ca n't just reduce harms caused by ML to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people , LeCun explained in a tweet about why such bias occurred in the case of PULSE . His initial response was to bring people 's attention towards the biases associated with the dataset . This did n't go well with the audience , and they accused LeCun of dousing the issue by bringing up the age-old excuse of datasets . Even though he tried to explain his stance on bias more eloquently in the follow-up tweets , there was no going back for the other side . <h> What The Practitioners Have To Say <p> I respectfully disagree w/ Yann here <p> As long as progress is benchmarked on biased data , such biases will also be reflected in the inductive biases of ML systems <p> Advancing ML with biased benchmarks and asking engineers to simply "" retrain models with unbiased data "" is not helpful https : //t.co/ecYxivQ7Y9 <p> Luca Massaron , a data scientist who has been in this field for more than a decade , says that though Yann LeCun is perfectly correct from a technical point of view , the reactions online and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an issue now for the public . <p> There is a widespread fear of unfair control and manipulation . People unconditionally , and somehow unreasonably , fear that AI will take away their liberty from them , not just their work . <p> Luca Massaron <p> "" Personally I do not fear Face Depixelizer or other experiments of this kind .

There is no one-stop solution to this . For the models to be unbiased towards certain groups or communities , there needs to be a representative who has been part of it . The ecosystem has to be incentivised in a way so that people from all walks of life can be heard and help build algorithms that we all can agree upon .

"<h> The Survivors Of The Walking Dead Have A New Worst Enemy : Themselves <p> As anyone who 's been living through the zombie apocalypse knows , everything falls apart eventually . Fortifications . Relationships . Communities . Morality . Anything people can build can also be destroyed ... and unfortunately , that includes the civilisation that Rick and so many others worked so hard to establish . <p> "" Silence the Whisperers "" is a very thoughtful episode of The Walking Dead , which is not an adjective that normally gets used to describe the show . Obviously , it is n't close to the level of , say , Breaking Bad or Mad Men , but this time , the major threat to the various colonists is n't from zombies or the Whisperers , but themselves . <p> That 's not to say that Whisperers and zombies are n't still threats -- when a tree falls just before a surprise zombie attack at Hilltop , the Whisperers are blamed immediately by its angry inhabitants -- but it 's the fear of and hate for the Whisperers that starts causing the real damage at Alexandria . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new leader of the Highwaypeople ) , and some other kid who presumably has a name which I ca n't remember start hassling Lydia , cruelly teasing her by putting a burlap sack with eyeholes on their heads to mock her origin . There have been plenty of bullies on The Walking Dead before , of course , so what 's most disturbing here is that Whisperer-hating Aaron is there , seeing it all , and just letting it happen . <p> Instead , it 's the increasingly redeemed Negan who 's there for Lydia , telling her not to fight them , but to "" kill "" her tormentors with kindness -- arguably the most anti-Saviour-era policy he could advise , but one he 's told her on more than one occasion . Of course , when Daryl spots the two of them talking , he breaks them up immediately , more because he knows that fraternizing with Negan will only cause people to hate Lydia rather than his distrust for Negan , although that 's certainly a factor . Lydia tartly replies that Negan gets her , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover someone has graffitied "" Silence the Whisperers "" on their door . <p> Hate speech is never a good sign , obviously , and Lydia does n't even try to the kindness approach . Instead , she plops down next to them at lunch , starts gutting a whole squirrel so that blood sprays on Gage 's face , and gives them a big , whispered "" Shh . "" Again , none of Alexandria 's leaders try to defuse the increasingly tense situation until Daryl pulls her out , and foolishly asks if Lydia can just avoid her tormenters . Lydia justifiably storms off . <p> That night , everything goes to hell . After dark , Gage , Margo , and Other Jerk assault Lydia , restraining her and beating her , even as she desperately reminds them she 'd abandoned the Whisperers long before Alpha put their friends ' heads on spikes , that she loved Henry , that the Alexandrians are her people now , all of which only infuriates the attackers more . It 's an immensely disturbing scene -- certainly more than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting to get on the Good Negan bandwagon , watching him burst onto the scene , throw Margo to the side , pull Gage off Lydia , and hold and console her then and there , well , hop on board . <p> There 's only one problem : Margo is dead . <p> AMC has only two official photos of Margo ( Jerri Tubbs ) and this is one of them . It 's fitting . ( Image : Gene Page , AMC ) <p> Negan killed her when he threw her to the side to protect Lydia ; by the hefty "" squelch "" sound effect that accompanies her landing , her head presumably landed on a rock . And now , even though neither Negan nor Lydia was at fault -- because Margo was the actual attacker -- the two most hated people in Alexandria are seen as killers of one of "" the good guys . "" <p> Lydia tries to defend Negan , but the Alexandrians want blood . However , Daryl believes Lydia and later goes to confront Negan in his cell , resulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversations ever . I could honestly quote the whole thing , but here 's a snippet of Negan talking to Daryl , right after he says he 's not at all sorry for killing an arsehole who was beating a kid : <p> "" But you already know that , do n't you ? You came down here to look me in the eye because you do n't know what to do with me . Shit , all that time you spent trying to kill me you spent fantasizing about my death , all that time you actually tried to kill me , and now look at you ? You 're not so sure . "" <p> Negan also wryly loves the irony that he started believing in Alexandria 's way of life and moral code , and now he 's going to be executed for actually doing the right thing . When Daryl says he 'll get a fair trial , Negan scoffs . But we 'll never know , because the next morning , when Gabriel goes to the jail to talk to the accused , Negan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make things much , much worse in Alexandria , and Lydia quickly confesses to letting Negan loose and marches right into the cell -- even though Daryl knows for a fact Lydia did n't do it . <p> But when he tries to get Lydia to leave the jail , she wo n't because she feels safe there -- just as Negan voluntarily returned to his cell after the **25;774;TOOLONG zombie attack in the season premiere . Negan knew people would start looking to punish an old enemy because they could n't fight their new enemy , and Lydia knows that with Negan gone , the Alexandrians will take out their anger and fear on the one scapegoat they have left . <p> Lydia 's safety is paramount , and not just because she has n't done anything wrong . As Michonne reminds Daryl earlier in the episode , the only thing that has kept Alpha from annihilating them all with her Zombie Bomb is because her daughter is inside Alexandria 's walls . If Lydia leaves or Alpha somehow learns she 's in danger , they are doomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about bullies -- the arseholes bullying Lydia , Alpha bullying the colonists , and Negan , who used to bully the colonists -- and repercussions . On their way to Hilltop , Michonne tells Judith there are some bullies you can live with , but there are others who will never stop taking what 's yours . <p> Negan had to be stopped back in the day , and Alpha needs to be stopped now . And despite Daryl and Negan 's futile suggestions , no matter what Lydia did , Gage , Margo , and Other Jerk were never going to leave her alone . However it played out , it was always going to end in tragedy for somebody . It was true with Negan , and it 's already true with Alpha and the Whisperers , too . <p> But the episode is also about those internal fractures that weaken the whole . The fear of the Whisperers is threatening to overcome the civilized society forged in Alexandria . Magda and Yumiko 's relationship has begun fraying because of the latter 's control issues and Siddiq 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point he may now be useless in an emergency . <p> Khary Payton does some fantastic work as Ezekiel in this episode . ( Image : Gene Page , AMC ) <p> The most poignant example is Ezekiel , who Michonne spies riding alone as she travels to Hilltop . When she catches up with him , he 's standing on a ledge , dead-eyed and hopeless , not jumping purely because of the inertia of sadness . He 's lost the Kingdom , Carol , Henry , even his tiger Shiva , and all he feels is his loss and his failure . ( Kudos to actor Khary Payton , because he captures that faraway , sick look of utter depression perfectly . ) But when Michonne reaches out to him , it draws him away from the ledge , literally and metaphorically . <p> Desperate for connection , Ezekiel impulsively kisses Michonne , who takes more than a few beats to pull back -- as she says later , she has n't kissed anyone over four feet tall in six years -- but it 's her empathy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time ago , but Michonne lost her first child in the zombie outbreak , and for a while , she was attacking zombies primarily in hopes they 'd kill her , and she and Ezekiel bond over how much harder it is to recover after losing everything a second time . It 's a pretty clear comparison between the power of coming together in compassion and the danger of coming together in fear and hate . <p> Unfortunately , the latter is much more prevalent in Alexandria , even as people realise the massive zombie attacks on all three colonies ( Oceanside 's occurs off-screen ) ca n't be a coincidence . As Carol tells Daryl , all the turmoil over Negan and Lydia and Margo is just a distraction , because the real enemy is outside . She 's not wrong , but she 's not exactly right , either . Because there 's a very real enemy inside Alexandria , too , and it 's not Negan or Lydia . <h> Assorted Musings : <p> I want to apologise in advance if I missed something here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , visually dark -- and a significant portion of this episode looked practically pitch black , so it was often tough to tell what was going on . <p> Judith is frighteningly adorable in this episode , and then she 's also devastatingly effective when it comes time to take down the zombies attacking Hilltop . But she 's also preternaturally wise when she suggests the Whisperers may be trying to tire them out with zombie attacks so they ' re even weaker when the real assault begins . I love Daryl , but I have to revise the mantra : If Judith dies , we riot . <p> Michonne says a relationship between her and Ezekiel never would have worked out because they 're both too stubborn . I 'm sorry , Michonne -- did you meet Rick Grimes while you were dating him for those four years ? <p> Yumiko used to be Magda 's lawyer ! I like the way that fun fact was tossed off so casually . <p> It 's genuinely funny how instantly Gage and Other Jerk 's accusation that Lydia somehow led them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a single question from Gabriel . <p> I 'm so happy AMC 's promotional images included a photo of Luke 's crazy-arse gear mace , because it 's spectacular . If the zombie apocalypse hits , it would definitely be my weapon of choice , because it looks just brutal . <h> Trending Stories Right Now <p> DJI just announced the latest member of its Mavic line , and it is tiny . The foldable Mavic Mini is roughly the size of three smartphones stacked on top of each other and weighs just 249 grams . Those drone regulations kick in for aircraft 250 grams and up , and if you 're thinking DJI is being a little sneaky , you 'd be correct . <p> As video games give players more freedom to explore complex digital worlds , it becomes more challenging for a CG character to naturally move and interact with everything in it .

"<h> Taiwan , South Korea re-launch trade promotional efforts in British Columbia <p> After months of pandemic-induced doldrums on the trade promotions front , Asian markets are again trying to garner more business interest from B.C. and elsewhere in Canada . <p> The one major difference in the current efforts -- when compared with previous events and trade shows -- is that almost all gatherings are now held virtually via the internet . The Taiwan External Trade Development Council ( TAITRA ) , for example , held its machine-manufacturing event on September 14 through both a YouTube press conference and a virtual-reality kiosk in a bid to secure Canadian business . <p> At the press conference , TAITRA president and CEO Walter Yeh said Taiwan is banking on the success of its fight against COVID -- recording one of the lowest active-case rates in the world -- in showcasing some of the technological capabilities that have helped in that fight . <p> "" As the world 's fourth-largest exporter of machine tools and components , Taiwan has averaged US$4 billion in exports in each of the last few years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 1,000 precision manufacturers and 10,000 upstream suppliers ; for this reason , Taiwan was able to boost face-mask production during the COVID-19 pandemic from 1.88 million masks a day in January to 20 million shortly afterwards .

"" Through this press conference , we will demonstrate how companies that have won the Taiwan Excellence Award can help their clients with innovative techniques and solutions to meet manufacturing demands in the post-pandemic era .

The one market where Stephens does see growth this year -- China -- he said will see minimal economic expansion , adding that any attempt to base a B.C. or Canadian economic recovery on China 's fortunes is "" not a solid one "" given the increasingly fractious relationship between Ottawa and Beijing . <p> In other markets , recessions have slowed demand -- meaning any growth will require a sharply focused approach by Canadian companies to find a specific demand for a specific product in a specific country . Only in cases where customers are well-defined and readily reachable would trade growth be possible , Stephens said . <p> "" It all has to do with demand on both sides of the Pacific , and things are n't looking too good , "" he said , citing a June World Bank report that projected 93% of the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "" Since Canada and Korea have a bilateral FTA , exporters on both sides have no major impediments to growing exports .

But the key , he added , will be to see whether the governments in those jurisdictions are willing to relinquish their traditional approach of favouring some local companies -- because investors and businesses from places like Canada and the United States need a level playing field to even consider getting involved in these markets , given global economic uncertainty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive to North American companies by staying open and free without showing excessive favouritism or political bias toward domestic players , "" he said . "" These markets can even cut North American businesses some breaks to attract more of them .

Such an FTA would be for security reasons as much as for anything else -- but it 'd still be good for business . "" *"
"<p> As we enter 2020 , we say goodbye to a long decade of technological advancement and information augmenting the business landscape globally . <p> That means a new beginning is on its way . A beginning that is poised to bring in a gamut of changes , ideas , innovation , information , and obviously some new challenges . Businesses that possess information are looking to make intelligent use of this otherwise junkish data . <p> Applications of data science <p> That naturally gives way to data analysis and data science technologies . Subsequently , it is critical to comprehend what is data science and how it is valuable for businesses of the information age . <p> Not only that , data science has also enabled numerous startups and enterprises worldwide to bring distinctive offerings making improvements in the business landscape as well as people 's lives . A great example is social media networks , and the way Facebook and similar legacy platforms have leveraged the power of data such as user demographics and interests to bring endless solutions for business owners and individuals . <h> What is data science ? <p> While there are endless ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' Data science is a multi-disciplinary domain that deploys scientific methods , algorithms , processes , and systems to extract graspable information and insights from structured and unstructured data sets to come to the final stage of decision making and predictions . ' <p> The data science domain employs mathematics , statistics , computer science , and information science to analyse and understand data . The final results and information are then converted into ideas , solutions , and offerings by the business decision makers . <h> Why do we need data science ? <p> It is really easy to understand the available structured data like that of Google Analytics that helps us ascertain the type of users visiting our platform . But that 's not the only kind of analysis to do . There is a lot of unstructured data available with organisations that can help their offerings to be much more personalised . <p> In comes data science ! It is used to analyse and draw meaningful insights out of semi-structured and unstructured data , various advanced analytics tools , and frameworks like Power BI , Apache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Python , which help carry the load . <h> Data science use cases <p> Talking about the use cases , there is no stop to the implementation of data and tools to make a difference in business or changing lives . Here are the cornerstone use cases of data science : <h> ? Decision-making <p> Data science has enabled businesses and industries in India and across the globe to analyse market trends , study users ' metrics , predict risks , and make ultimately make careful decisions . There are a number of case studies such as Flipkart vs . Walmart by Data Flair backing the importance of data science in terms of minimising losses Data science has facilitated rapid growth in industries and has minimised their losses . <h> ? Understanding demand <p> With the ever-evolving , competitive business landscape , it has become critical to understand the users and their requirements precisely . With data science , it is possible to create and utilise time-saving automated models to go into users ' purchase history , age , income level , and related demographics . This helps to assess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> ? Artificial intelligence <p> Artificial intelligence and machine learning are the new cool as demonstrated in movies such as Iron Man . Taking a more real-life case , having a self-driving car today is entirely the outcome of processing data , utilising machine learning algorithms , and implementation of instructions by the machine . <h> ? Predictive analysis <p> Weather forecast is a great example of predictive analysis . It is required by space research organisations , media portals , and the aviation industry . The data pulled from radars and satellites is analysed and used to provide predictions related to weather changes and natural calamities . <h> ? Fraud detection <p> Industries such as telecommunications and social media , which are attracting millions of users and subscribers daily really need to moderate the activities of the users . Frauds such as illegal access , theft , impersonation , cloning , and any other such activities can be monitored and prevented with data science . <h> ? Product development <p> Doing business in the digital era needs accumulating data and analysis to bypass competition and identify user interests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data tools not only to ease up the product development process but also to bring the unique offerings that society lacks today . Here , we ca n't ignore the impact of Airbnb and OYO , which have augmented the entire landscape of the hospitality industry on a global level . <h> Scope of data science in India <p> India is undeniably one of the cornerstones of the IT industry today . Enterprises today leverage the power of data to hire , train , and improvise functions within organisations . <p> At the same time , the rapidly increasing demand for data scientists and experts ca n't be ignored . IBM has predicted that the demand for data scientists will soar 28 percent by 2020 . It is the very need of the hour for organisations to hire employees armed with data science to create relevancy with the market requirements and sustain in the competitive business environment of the present and the future . <p> A report published by Express Computer back in July 2018 outlines how OYO utilised data science to come up with a distinctive offering making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Hindu , at the beginning of 2019 , there were close to 97,000 data analytics jobs vacant in India , of which 45 percent lie in data analytics companies . All this makes data science a hot career choice . <h> Career options for data scientists in India <h> ? Data analyst <p> As a data analyst working for an organisation , you are responsible for analysing large amounts of complex data , identify patterns , and derive conclusions carried forward to make prudent business decisions . <h> ? Business intelligence ( BI ) developer <p> As a BI developer , you contribute towards organisational growth by developing strategies . You need to deploy various BI tools and build custom models to facilitate understandability for the leaders of an organisation . <h> ? Data architect <p> Data architects ensure maximum performance built by data scientists and developers by testing and demonstrating the results . <h> ? Applications architect <p> Applications architects track the behaviour of applications used within a business and how they interact with each other and with the end users . <h> ? Infrastructure architect <p> Infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development of new technologies and system requirements . A great example of this role is a very trending one - cloud infrastructure architect . <h> ?

One also needs to possess managerial skills to be eligible for this role . <h> ? Machine learning scientist <p> Machine learning scientists understand the binary language behind the applications and models . They perform batch processing of accumulated data to make it readable for data scientists . As a machine learning scientist , you are also responsible for researching new data approaches and algorithms , create data funnels , and deliver solutions . <h> Education qualifications and skills required <p> Being technical and analytical to the core , the data science domain requires expertise in various disciplines including , mathematics , statistics , IT , and computer science . Some common educational qualifications required to become a data scientist would be : <p> Bachelor 's degree in IT , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Master 's degree in mathematics , computer science . <p> A certification in data science and data analytics is always demanded by most of the organisations across various sectors such as healthcare , aviation , automobile , FMCG , telecommunication and many more . <p> Data scientists in India earn an average of Rs 650,000 in a year . While the job roles and opportunities associated with the data science domain are appealing , these involve a steep learning curve , experience and a technical background - making data science a tough domain to crack . The steep learning curve associated with data science is evidently the reason behind the ever-increasing demand and shortage of supply of data scientists in India . And therein lies its potential ."
"<p> San Francisco , June 27 ( AP/UNB ) -- Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the company is evaluating how it should handle "" deepfake "" videos created with artificial intelligence and high-tech tools to yield false but realistic clips . <p> In an interview at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado on Wednesday , Zuckerberg said it might make sense to treat such videos differently from other misinformation such as false news . Facebook has long held that it should not decide what is and is n't true , leaving such calls instead to outside fact-checkers . <p> But Zuckerberg says it 's worth asking whether deepfakes are a "" completely different category "" from regular false statements . He says developing a policy on these videos is "" really important "" as AI technology grows more sophisticated . <p> Facebook , like other social media companies , does not have a specific policy against deepfakes , whose potential threat has emerged only in the last couple of years . Company executives have said in the past that it makes sense to look at them under the broader umbrella of false or misleading information . But Zuckerberg is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility that Facebook might ban deepfakes altogether . <p> Doing so , of course , could get complicated . Satire , art and political dissent could be swept up in any overly broad ban , creating more headaches from Facebook . <p> Other false videos could still get a pass . For instance , the recent altered video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that made her sound like she was slurring her words does not meet the definition of a deepfake."
"<p> If I say ' Nokia ' what immediately comes to mind ? If you are Finnish , perhaps its ' pride ' . If you have been watching the name return to the smartphone market it might be ' phoenix ' . I 'm pretty that for a lot of people ' nostalgia ' would be one of the top answers . <p> But there 's one element of Nokia that everyone knows . Nokia phones have the Snake game . <p> A person plays "" Snake "" game on the new "" Nokia 3310 "" model of Finnish HMD global on the first day of ... + the Mobile World Congress in Barcelonaon on February 27 , 2017 in Barcelona .

Because the Snake game everyone associates with Nokia is n't the same game that runs on the new handsets . If you want to be awkward that Snake game everyone remembers is n't even the first Snake game Nokia shipped . <p> Nokia was not the first company to ship a device with a game in the Snake genre . Given the simplicity of the underlying game you 'll find examples going back to 1976 , as commercial releases for early home computers , type-in listings to teach programming , through to its inclusion on the Nokia 6110 .

Because of the fascination of Snake on the Nokia 3310 , it has been seen as the default version , the one that nostalgia brings to mind . And while the new Nokia handsets tap into that , the version of Snake that ships with the machine looks nothing like the Snake everyone remembers loving , nor does it play remotely like Snake from 1997 or Snake from 2000 . <p> Perhaps the clue is in the name . Snakes . Not Snake . <p> Because if you go back , there was a ' classic Nokia ' game called Snakes . The 2005 release was a huge step up from the monochrome top down view seen in the early Nokia Snake games . It brought color to the game , it brought not just square grids but hexagonal grids . It brought bonus pickups , local multiplayer over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another handset over bluetooth , global high scores , a 3D board that allowed you to snake around the top surface and then the underside , or on a sphere ... <p> "" At the very core of the game , Snakes is a straight line moving around a grid . But you can forget about a white background and a black snake line that you would see in the "" Snake "" game on a regular Nokia phone ( or even in the mini-game "" The Sims "" ) , because we 've a riot of colour , shapes , graphics and noise coming at you from the screen . Watching someone else play Snakes is like the travelling through the Stargate at the end of 2001 . "" <p> But there is a catch . Snakes was launched alongside the Nokia N-Gage QD , the second of Nokia 's gaming focused smartphones .

"<h> FOLLOW US ON <h> Ad Space <h> Article <h> The case for applying digital transformation principles to reinvent marketing <p> This post is sponsored by Edelman Singapore . <p> Customer centricity , design thinking , agility , DevOps , prototyping , big data , artificial intelligence , and blockchain , are the currency of digital transformation . It is also where the major corporate investments to be future-ready are centred . <p> Meanwhile , marketing and brand communication , along with efforts to engage and converse with revenue-generating customers , seem less in the limelight . Despite the plethora of martech and performance options , inspired and insight-rich creative solutions and platforms that wow and engage new and existing customers to brand advocacy are in short supply . <p> The C-suite has swelled following the inception of new Cs in the form of the CIO , CGO , and CDO -- with seemingly sexier and more lavishly budgeted portfolios . <p> But if we think back to even the most basic definition of marketing -- pre Byron Sharp and mental and physical availability -- to the 4Ps of product , place , promotion , and price , there is a good reason why the chief marketing officer should be regaining their seat as the most important role in terms of the ongoing wellbeing of a company . <p> Marketing is the function which truly understands customers . From their needs and wants , the implications for emotional and rational involvement with brands , to their subsequent purchases and ongoing relationships . <p> It is also the role most qualified to combine creativity , strategy and all pervasive technology to truly differentiate and build a brand . <p> The time is ripe for marketing ( and by definition the CMO ) to retake its role as the primary driver of the wellbeing of a corporation and brand . <p> We 've seen this dynamic in action at some innovative brands , such as Mastercard . A former client , Sam Ahmed , now leading eCommerce at Facebook , was a key inspiration in driving initiatives such as the Mastercard Priceless Engine some years ago . A proponent of putting marketing firmly at the centre of the business . <p> With our heritage in helping brands build trust , and as an agency network also constantly redefining ourselves to be future-ready , Edelman recognises this dynamic and has defined a collaborative methodology to put marketing firmly back at the pinnacle of C-suite influence . We call this BrandVision . <p> BrandVision is a structured approach that brings together deep customer understanding via our proprietary "" Data Fusion "" process with the proven techniques of design thinking . It is also geared towards developing outcomes in terms of brand marketing road maps and prototype innovation initiatives . <p> With sharp-shooting audience content/message consumption understanding , and channel engagement insights , we can deliver dynamic personas . This allows us to look at people via look-alike "" pattern-of-life "" audiences , regardless of whether the channel and media they are consuming is buyable via advertising , or not . <p> With the advent of always-on digital , nothing is static . Passions , fads , likes , and dislikes are in constant flux as our target markets continue to evolve . We believe this should be reflected in marketing and communications . <p> We elevate data-driven audience insights a step further to produce predictive intelligence via the Edelman Predictive Intelligence Centre , or EPIC as we call it . In partnership with Singapore 's Economic Development Board , Edelman 's specialist capabilities open up the potential to tap on expertise in machine learning and big data modelling . <p> The net result is a solution which genuinely puts today 's and tomorrow 's customer at the centre of a highly efficient and relevant marketing plan . <p> And while sales growth will continue to be a primary indicator of the performance of a company -- transformative realities such as global warming , social influence , fake news and even geopolitical realities such as Trump and Brexit mean that a more diverse definition of marketing success is required . <p> Fjord ( the design and innovation consultancy within Accenture Interactive ) refers to this as the many facets of growth . <p> Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff also echoes this : "" It 's time for a new capitalism -- a more fair , equal and sustainable capitalism that actually works for everyone , and where businesses do n't just take from society , but truly give back and have a positive impact . "" <p> The marketing function and CMO as figurehead have a pivotal role to play here -- while Edelman has the perfect tool to facilitate that role via BrandVision."

ETCIO Updated : June 18 , 2019 , 07:27 IST <p> Oyo has revolutionized the fragmented and legacy-driven budget hospitality space by empowering small asset owners with the operational capabilities that enable them to compete with big hotel chains and achieve high occupancies . <p> Oyo today host guests from around the world in over 20,000 franchised and leased hotels and over 700,000 rooms , and more than 45,000-holiday homes adding over 70,000 rooms every month , globally . <p> According to Anil Goel , Group Chief Technology &amp; Product Officer , Oyo Hotels &amp; Homes , hospitality and real estate are broken categories . There is a huge disconnect between demand and supply of quality living spaces , forcing travellers and city-dwellers to compromise on location , quality , and price . <p> "" At Oyo , we leverage the right technology and talent to deliver predictable , affordable , anytime-available stay experiences for travellers - a tech-driven hospitality business model and the first-of-its-kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oyo 's biggest differentiator is its full-stack fulfillment led model , where they fully acquire hotels and homes , on franchise or lease , renovate it and bring it up to Oyo standards , use technology and operational capabilities to ensure seamless management of the property - revenue , pricing , day to day guest experience , etc. , and then use an omnichannel distribution strategy , across online and offline channels , leading to over 90% of their demand . <p> Oyo 's digital strategyGoel explains that their digital strategy is threefold - Customer Experience , On Ground Team/Employee Operating Efficiency and Asset Owner Support . Backed by innovative technology , Oyo 's plans to upgrade all forms of real estate and thereby provide quality living spaces to travellers around the world . <p> "" We focus on digitizing all aspects to create an efficient tech-empowered ecosystem .

Barcodes , mobile payments and cloud-based technologies are slowly yet steadily replacing cash deposit boxes or cash registers or any other physical payment system . This simply increases security , efficiency as well as transparency . <p> "" Through AI and machine learning , we look at multiple metrics from time of day , weather , location to local events , to be able to learn more and more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what are the search results the customer is most likely to appreciate , "" shares Goel . <p> Goel believes image recognition and AI will help simplify the auditing process in the future .

According to Forbes , The Panda algorithm has seemingly been incorporated into the core algorithm , in fact , although the last update still seems to still be the 4.2 , which is from March 2015 . And while the volatility of January 2016 rankings seemed to show that a Penguin update was finally uploaded , Google 's Webmaster Trend Analyst John Mueller confirmed that it was due to core algorithm changes instead . <p> The rapid advancement of mobile technologies is deeply affecting the entire web scenario .

"<h> Lessons from Japan -- The Land of the Rising Sun <h> Lessons from Japan -- The Land of the Rising Sun <p> Both Bradley and I have been fortunate to have been invited to spend some time in the beautiful city of Tokyo during the past year . Bradley worked with Accenture as part of an economic development mission designed to help the Tokyo Metropolitan Government promote its growing tech and fintech ecosystem and became an Ambassador for Invest Tokyo ( you can read about his journey here ) . <p> More recently , I had the wonderful opportunity to participate in the 4th annual FINSUM conference and share my thoughts on the intersection of fintech and longevity . The conference covered a variety of topics from the future of payments , fintech innovation , and the evolving world of financial services covering more specifically the impact of big technology firms , artificial intelligence and ethics , the role of data , and much more . <p> Throughout the FINSUM 's sessions and beyond , one could feel the energy around the exploration of the next frontiers of finance , in a city very eager to regain its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what stood out for me was not just the engagement of the conference itself , but more so what I observed while walking around the metropolitan city of Tokyo . If there was one thing that stands out in Tokyo -- and Japan itself -- it is the sense of homogeneity , pride of its culture and heritage , and an overwhelming sense of community spirit . <p> Japan is known as the most ultra-aged society globally , where one in four Japanese citizens are 65 or older . This fact , combined with healthy lifestyles and one of the world 's longest life expectancies , means that Japan must rapidly address longevity-related challenges alongside providing some unique lessons for our global society . Japan approaches everything about aging quite differently than the rest of the world -- it is tangible -- and something that you can initially witness subtly through the age of their cab drivers and later more demonstrably through the pervasiveness of their overall age-inclusive work culture . <p> Not only does Japan have one of the most comprehensive social care systems for older adults in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ageless society encourages workers to stay employed longer , and sets the tone for private sectors to hire more older adults . <p> Japan is the only country in the world with a national public holiday called Respect for the Aged Day , or Keiro no Hi -- to honor the country 's aging citizens . Japan 's public and private sectors embrace this societal zeitgeist by working diligently to address the needs of its aging population through technology , innovation , policy , and structural changes . <p> As a very homogenous people -- Japan 's population includes only 1.5-percent immigrants compared to 5 percent in the United Kingdom and 17 percent in the United States -- the Japanese have historically approached systemic challenges as one people , one community -- by demonstrating the technological and manufacturing prowess of China ; the innovation , research and academic focus of the United States ; and the deference to its unique culture and history seen throughout Europe . <p> Walking around Tokyo , you notice all the little details that go into urban planning to ensure accessibility and convenience for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapt to their everyday needs . Major crosswalks are equipped with a special button that can be pushed to allow pedestrians extra time to cross . More companies are developing products and services that seek to improve the quality of life for older adults , and to help them stay connected as active participants of the society . Curiously , I hear more discussions around creating insurance and financial products for adult children taking care of their aging parents travelling through Asia than I do in Europe or back home in the U.S .. <p> Appreciation for seniors is ingrained throughout Asian culture , where being old is an asset , instead of a liability . Such attitudes can not be more different compared to how old age is perceived in the United States , a country where assisted living centers are profit centers and fintech is focused on instagram fueled millennials instead of longer living boomers . Respect and dignity for one 's elders , and the creation of innovative solutions to meet their needs , has never been a facet of daily life in the U.S. as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the future reality that Japan 's fate is also our own . <p> Japan is not only the land of the rising sun , it is also a country of hope and aspiration , where culture and values blend in harmony with modern technology . The Japanese island nation has shown us that we can live in the future 's past , that we can grow , and innovate , without giving up our traditions . While technology is as important as it is prevalent in their society , much of what transformed the country remains uniquely human . Its public policies , along with innovations and actions by the private sectors can help pave the way for the rest of the world to follow . <p> There is much to gain from the lessons of Japan . Perhaps what society needs is not round the clock access to socialdata and status updates -- but rather , 24 ? 7 access to empathy and emotions -- the very essence that defines the human race -- and also the best way for us all to find commonality . Only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own outlook on life to see more than ourselves . Only by going back to our roots can we best plan for our future . Only by daring to dream can we achieve those goals that make the greatest impact on society .

"<h> Leverage , deals &amp; a succession plan : Mukesh Ambani has an eye on the future <p> Ambani has also been negotiating with Saudi Aramco for an equity partnership at the flagship refining and petrochemicals business . <h> Highlights <p> RIL has been the busiest deal maker in India Inc , buying businesses and selling stakes in them . <p> Ambani has also been negotiating with Saudi Aramco , the world 's largest oil company . <p> After investing more than $40 billion to create the world 's largest 4G network for Jio , India 's richest man would certainly like to take some money off the table . <p> When Saudi oil minister Khalid al-Falih made his second visit to India in less than three weeks in March to attend Akash Ambani 's wedding , it was expected that a Reliance-Saudi Aramco alliance was just round the corner . Al-Falih , also Saudi Aramco 's chairman , had previously let the cat out of the bag -- first in December during the Udaipur festivities that marked Isha Ambani 's wedding , then in February when he accompanied Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman for a state visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Riyadh , "" he said . <p> On February 20 , Lutyen 's Delhi had even been buzzing with speculation that a deal announcement was due . What came instead at that time was an innocuous statement from the Saudi Aramco chief executive Amin Al-Nasser about joint investments with Reliance in refining and petrochemicals , almost echoing his boss ' previous statements . <p> But for those who still find it difficult to fathom that Mukesh Ambani would seriously consider diluting his hold over the Reliance Industries ( RIL ) crown jewel , especially since he has always chosen to build rather than buy in his home market , here 's a reality check . <p> RIL has been the busiest deal maker in India Inc , buying businesses and selling stakes in them . In the past two years or so , it has bought or invested in around 27 businesses , half of them in the telecom and media space , to bulk up operations that are still at the growth stage . These range from music streaming apps and cable networks to telecom software and hardware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past five years , 79% has been allocated toward deals in the telecom sector , Morgan Stanley estimates . <p> At the same time , for perhaps the first time , the company has been proactively exploring asset monetising even in its core home market through stake sales , innovative structures such as infrastructure investment trusts ( InvITs ) or even the outright sale of assets and businesses . <p> This , evidently , is a new strategy after the failed bid for Lyondell Bassell in 2009-10 or the misadventures in US shale gas , and has much to do with ensuring that the legacy of fiscal discipline endures as it is . <p> Reliance will sell stakes in firms that own its fleet of very large ethane-carrying ships to Japan 's Mitsui OSK Lines , it said on April 17 . Reliance Jio Infocomm has already transferred its fibre and tower assets into two separate InvITcontrolled special purpose vehicles ( SPVs ) to reduce liabilities of $15 billion . <p> "" The end objective will be to have a different set of investors who would want to run these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets , so liabilities also go down , "" Srikanth Venkatachari , joint chief financial officer , RIL , had said in January . "" We were surprised with the scale of the demerged tower and fibre assets ( book value of $18 billion ) , which is the largest among telecom operators in India , "" adds Nikhil Bhandari of Goldman Sachs Research . <p> Ambani has also been negotiating with Saudi Aramco , the world 's largest oil company , and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co for months now , for an equity partnership at the flagship refining and petrochemicals business . He has already sold his private pipeline entity for $2 billion to Brookfield , with an option of buying it back after two decades . <p> PLANNING AHEADAfter investing more than $40 billion to create the world 's largest 4G network for Jio , India 's richest man would certainly like to take some money off the table . <p> With net liabilities of $45.1 billion , according to Jefferies , even Reliance needs to think of fiscal management , especially when it needs ammunition for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Walmart-owned Flipkart and Alibaba . <p> But , having turned 62 this April , this portfolio management exercise by Mukesh Ambani is also about baby steps toward succession planning . <p> Ambani Senior is an astute billionaire , a perfectionist manager who revels in projects of unprecedented scale and scope . First , refining and petrochemicals , then retail and now telecom -- the Reliance juggernaut has disrupted businesses across brick-and-mortar and digital like few others before it . <p> He 's also a doting father who wants to ensure his legacy endures through his three children -- Isha , Akash and Anant . And he well knows the pitfalls of not having a clear plan for who gets to run what . <p> All three are adults , two of whom are active in the business and married , with the third about to do so . As several of Reliance 's newer group businesses achieve adolescence , recasting the empire is seen as logical and value accretive all round . This could involve various strategies , such as spinning off retail or petrochemicals and bringing a specialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their expertise and cash , pay off debt , improve return on capital and reward shareholders . The next generation could each run telecom and media , retail , and energy as verticals with share sales that would release value . <p> It is a sensible step , feels ET columnist and family business historian Sonu Bhasin . "" The promoter gives an opportunity to his inheritors to operate somewhat independently while protecting the core business . The inheritors , too , get an opportunity to work without a constant over-the-shoulder hovering presence of the patriarch ! To build businesses with longevity , and to keep the legacy going , this verticalisation is one of the logical ways . "" Quoting US industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie , she adds , "" ' Three generations from shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves ' the most difficult transition that family businesses make globally is from second to third . "" . <p> Some family friends disagree . "" He 's all keyed up . He 's building the business for the next phase of his life . This is classic MDA 3.0 , "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gas exploration and Jio 's teething problems , he 's an entrepreneur again . He 's done with his parental duties , got the kids settled . He 's raring to go and is all keyed up . Other family related distractions are also gone . "" <p> Investors also prefer cleaner , leaner structures or verticals , discounting holding companies or a mixed bag of operations that tend to distract management . Conglomerates across the world have had to face the wrath of activist shareholders who have clamoured for carveouts and spinoffs to unlock value . <p> In Pic : Akash , Anant , Isha , Nita and Mukesh Ambani.WIN-WIN FOR ALL ? Reliance Industries is at a crossroads in more ways than one -- its organisational DNA is changing as GeNext takes up more proactive roles in executive leadership and management . Meanwhile , the old-world commodities and industrials champion is evolving into an increasingly consumer-facing enterprise . <p> The legacy energy business still constitutes the lion 's share of 75% of group 's Ebitda ( earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortisation ) while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to take that to 50% as Reliance looks to pivot to being India 's answer to Google or Apple -- or better still , a combination of AT&amp;T and Amazon -- to offset business cyclicality . <p> March quarter results announced on April 18 show why that makes sense -- refining margins continue to be squeezed , leading to an 18.6% drop in sequential Ebit while retail and telecom , though improving , are yet to offset the shortfall . <p> "" RIL highlighted ' unprecedented capacity buildup in ethylene and paraxylene chains , utilisation rates to drop and weakening olefin and aromatic cycle . ' This is the most negative commentary we have heard from RIL in petrochem . Given the sheer size of the business ( 43% of FY19 Ebitda ) , multiyear weakness in petrochem would be negative , "" highlight Pinakin Parekh and Sanket P Parab of JP Morgan . SELL STRATEGIC ... But getting closer to consumers and fortifying the telecom and retail businesses , the next big frontiers , will need money -- and lots of it . Reliance has already spent $2.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets . Jio 's liabilities alone have ballooned to Rs 1.29 lakh crore in March 2019 , as per CLSA estimates , which includes Rs 67,000 crore of debt and Rs 21,100 crore of spectrum liabilities . But as the competition fights to retain share with the refarming of spectrum in 4G and introduction of minimum average revenue per user ( ARPU ) plans , the economics of the telecom trade have become challenging . <p> As mentioned before , with a user clocking below $2 in average billing , even an ambitious 30% operating margin for a 1 billion-plus market translates to $8 billion gross Ebitda . Doubling revenue market share to 40% would only lead to a $3 billion Ebitda pie for Jio , after deploying 12 times that in investments . Ambani needs a silver bullet -- and that will come from ecommerce , content and carveouts . <p> A blockbuster deal -- say with Aramco and/ or others -- can slash a third of the liabilities that Reliance has and even help on long-term crude contracts . BP has been its partner for the upstream oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alliance could be the launch pad for joint petrol pumps and aviation turbine fuel ( ATF ) sales to take on newer entrants such as Rosneft . Ambani was in Abu Dhabi last week . He and his senior management had visited Riyadh in February to meet the Aramco top brass and even discussed new frontiers of R&amp;D and product development , including crude to chemicals and non-metallics . <p> Selling tower assets to Brookfield or floating another InvIT-like structure with five to six sovereign wealth funds , such as Abu Dhabi Investment Authority ( ADIA ) , Qatar Investment Authority ( QIA ) and long-only pension funds like Canada Pension Plan Investment Board ( CPPIB ) or Public Sector Pension Investment Board ( PSP , also Canadian ) will further improve net debt to Ebitda ratio of around 3.7x , based on the current year 's debt and earnings estimates . <p> ... BUY STRATEGIC TOOReliance has always chosen its partners carefully . Bringing BP on board in 2011 was as much about its deep-water drilling and natural gas expertise as it was for the cash . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betting small yet strategically on sunrise offerings -- frontier applications developed by niche , nascent entrepreneurs . He 's seeking to integrate complementary services under the telecom and media businesses , becoming both , a software developer as well as a hardware manufacturer , in the process . <p> The recent M&amp;As are all aimed at creating a digital ecosystem around Jio , acknowledged Anshuman Thakur , the telecom unit 's strategy head . "" Lots of things we do organically , but we come across entrepreneurs , business leaders who are doing interesting work on technology , on platforms that can be integrated with Jio , "" he said on April 18 . "" There are certain core capabilities that some of these companies bring , such as national language processing or artificial intelligence ( AI ) , so we are looking at those capabilities ... There are people focusing on them so it helps to expand faster , and this is with focus on whole digital services layers .

Fibre-to-the-home ( FTTH ) will provide broadband access and pay TV , along with a range of new-generation services . The Hathaway and Den acquisitions provide access to living rooms across India . Next up : The internet of things . <p> The Reliance Retail omnichannel initiatives are being implemented through Reliance Trends and partner brand stores integrated for online order fulfilment , returns and refunds . The recent policy flux gives it a distinct edge over overseas-owned ecommerce rivals . To plug the gaps , Reliance is buying fashion brands from ITC . It has also acquired Haptik , which runs one of the world 's largest conversational AI platforms and focuses on key customer engagement use cases such as concierges , lead generation and live chat . Loss-making toymaker Hamleys , already the most successful joint venture partner of Reliance Brands , is also likely to be scooped up . <p> "" This is a perfect string of pearls . For a Reliance , these are small transactions and often go unnoticed , "" says an investment banker who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anonymity . <p> After years , the Reliance stock has been on a rising streak -- up 45% in the last 12 months , during which the Nifty50 has barely climbed 12% . Investors would only want more from here on . Put yourself in Mukesh Ambani 's shoes . More than improving leverage ratios or market capitalisation , what would be the greatest prize ? A legacy that can be sustained over the next few generations . And to that effect , he has set the ball rolling ."

"<h> Trust In The Financial Sector : What Drives It And How To Earn It <p> While the U.S. economy made significant strides following the 2008 recession , one area that continues to struggle is consumer trust in the financial sector . More than 10 years later , the financial services industry is still working to bounce back : A recent Edelman survey reported sharp declines in trust in 2018 . <p> While the U.S. economy made significant strides following the 2008 recession , one area that continues to struggle is consumer trust in the financial sector . <p> Getty <p> This landscape can be daunting for banks , but some financial institutions see an opportunity to rebuild trust by focusing on doing right by their customers , employees and communities . Here 's what drives trust in the financial sector and what banks can do to rebuild it . <p> What drives trust : An ethical internal culture <p> One of the most important steps also takes the most work : building an ethical organization from the inside . <p> "" The best way to earn trust is to be trustworthy , "" said Tae Wan Kim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tepper School of Business . "" You can rely on your watch because it 's dependable and punctual , but you can not trust your watch , because it does n't have any inner self . Trustworthiness is about inner self . "" <p> And when it comes to businesses , Kim said , the workplace culture of the organization takes on this role of inner self . So , a business must foster an ethical organizational culture that instills strong values in all employees -- from the C-suite to frontline staff . If a bank makes headlines for executives committing fraud , or if a teller is n't honest with a customer , those actions can affect the perceived trustworthiness of the entire company . <p> How to earn it : Motivating thousands of employees to consistently make the right choices is n't an easy job . But companies that put in the effort may find it 's worth it . "" At U.S. Bank , it starts with creating an environment where every employee has a voice and can speak up , knowing that we will listen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank . "" We have a mantra : Speak up , listen up , follow up . "" <p> When employees can live out their values and believe in the values of their employer , they can authentically act in the best interest of the customer . <p> "" Every single one of our employees is an ambassador of this company , "" said Lawler . "" We build trust with our customers one interaction at a time . "" And for U.S. Bank , the approach yields results : In 2019 , U.S. Bank was named a World 's Most Ethical Company by the Ethisphere Institute for the fifth consecutive year . <p> What drives trust : Pairing data with personal knowledge <p> "" All commercial banks use machine learning technology now , "" said Kim . Algorithms might be responsible for determining whether or not customers qualify for loans , for example . <p> But data is imperfect and often lacks key context that humans consider during the decision-making process . Studies also show that incomplete or missing data can lead to discrimination . <p> In addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leverage a rich customer database to ultimately help their clients . But striking a balance is essential : As they aim to harvest insights , companies should not only consider data 's inherent shortcomings but also emphasize privacy and maintain transparency about the data 's use . <p> "" We 're not just here to check the box on compliance , "" said Lawler . "" We 're going to leverage this requirement as an opportunity to really get to know our customers . "" <p> The bank aims to learn where customers are in their financial journey and what their goals are . For example , if someone comes in requesting an equity loan , a banker will ask about the customer 's plans and discuss whether the loan is the best product for meeting short- and long-term goals . <p> "" We 've really worked hard with our frontline bankers to teach them how to have those meaningful conversations to get to know their customer and understand what they 're trying to accomplish so we can better meet their needs , "" Lawler said . <p> What drives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world where one in four consumers experienced cybercrime in 2018 , financial institutions must aggressively and transparently protect their customers . That means protecting them from cybercrime , as well as protecting their privacy by not selling or sharing consumer data with third parties . "" Financial institutions have a special duty to protect consumers ' online privacy , "" said Kim . <p> U.S. Bank currently has hundreds of U.S. Bank Cyber Defense Center employees in five global locations monitoring more than four billion cyber events daily . It also partners with other financial institutions through the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center . <p> "" We are n't competing with other banks on safety and soundness -- it 's a shared responsibility , "" said Lawler . "" We want to make sure we 're all strong on cybersecurity because it 's in everyone 's best interest . "" <p> And when it comes to privacy , banks should be just as protective of the data consumers share with them -- using it only to benefit customers and informing customers on how the information is used . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "" said Kim . "" One way to maintain that trust is transparency . "" When customers know what you 're planning to do with their data , there are no surprises -- and no breaches of trust . <p> What drives trust : Sincere community investment <p> How banks execute corporate responsibility programs makes all the difference in trust-building . If a bank sends employees out to volunteer for causes they doubt their employer really cares about , it 'll show -- and undercut any community trust the bank hopes to build . <p> "" Employees will have some skepticism about the sincerity of the external activities if inside the company it does not appear that they really care about ethics , "" Kim said . <p> How to earn it : Many banks and other organizations make a point to be visibly invested in every community they serve through volunteering and other philanthropic efforts . Kim emphasized that choosing the right cause for your organization is key . <p> "" My recommendation is to take advantage of the bank ' ' own resources to have the most effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aligning the company 's core mission and capabilities , like financial resources and expertise . <p> For example , at U.S. Bank , community outreach includes initiatives around financial literacy that help customers and other community members make better financial decisions . <p> "" We get out in the communities to really help our customers and non-customers have the information they need to make strong financial choices so that we can serve them better , "" Lawler said . "" We 're in the business of helping our customers with their financial well-being , and that is the role of trust . "" <p> Restoring trust in financial institutions is essential , not just because of the pivotal role they play in the global economy , but also because trust is integral to their core mission . And to get there , it involves more than asking customers for their trust -- it requires foundational values within the organization . If banks start by incorporating ethical behavior into their workplace culture , the ethics they build internally will translate to stronger trust from consumers . @"
"<h> Vindicated Covid-19 models warn pandemic is far from over <p> Modelers have watched with a mixture of horror and frustration as their projections of the pandemic 's evolution have come to fruition . <p> Daniel Hertzberg / for NBC News <p> Sept. 24 , 2020 , 4:15 PM UTC <p> By Denise Chow <p> When the coronavirus pandemic hit the United States this year , scientific models forecasting hundreds of thousands of deaths were met by some people with derision . <p> The models , unfortunately , have been vindicated . And they 're providing fresh warnings that a recent uptick in numbers of cases could mean the U.S. death toll could almost double in the next four months . <p> "" If we go back to March , at that time , we were saying if this thing is not handled very carefully , we could end up with 200,000 or 300,000 deaths , "" said a coronavirus modeler , Alessandro Vespignani , director of Northeastern University 's Network Science Institute . "" At that time , everyone was saying that 's impossible . I think we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future . "" <p> After beating back an initial wave of coronavirus infections , some countries in Europe find themselves in familiar territory : facing a spike in the number of new cases and weighing which restrictions could help drive the numbers down . In the U.S. , after a brief dip earlier this month , the number of new cases daily is creeping up again . Since Sept. 18 , the seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases in the country has n't fallen below 40,000 a day , according to an NBC News tally . <p> For coronavirus modelers , the writing has been on the wall . Many have watched with a mixture of horror and frustration as their projections of the pandemic 's evolution , and its potential death toll , have come to fruition . <p> But infectious disease modeling can be a tricky science easy to criticize for its uncertainties . Experts say coronavirus models have come a long way since the early days of the pandemic , to the point where some researchers are moving away from long-term projections and focusing instead on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six weeks . <p> Not all the models were accurate . Their biggest mistake came in terms of Africa , where some predicted severe outbreaks . Instead , much of the continent has avoided the worst of the pandemic . <p> The director of the institute , Dr. Christopher Murray , a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington , said his team 's U.S. model has undergone numerous refinements throughout the pandemic . Behavioral changes -- such as diligent mask-wearing -- could drive their projections for January down , but he also worries about fatigue settling in . <p> Murray said the new trajectory can already be seen in some European countries , including Spain , France and the United Kingdom . <p> That 's why modelers are hoping people heed their warnings about the coming weeks , when , they say , growing complacency and changing behaviors tied to the fall and winter seasons could result in a new wave of infections . <p> "" I think some people think the worst is over , "" he said . "" That progressive decline in vigilance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "" <p> The University of Washington institute 's model , which is one of several the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses to track the pandemic , has been criticized for often including high degrees of uncertainty , which can lead to imprecise predictions . Early on , the model underestimated the number of Covid-19 deaths nationwide , projecting that the U.S. could hit 60,415 by the end of August . <p> Still , the model is updated frequently , and refinements are made as data on case numbers , hospitalizations and a host of other factors become available . By June , the institute 's model was estimating that the U.S. death toll could hit 200,000 by Oct. 1 , a projection that ended up being accurate to within two weeks . <p> But infectious disease models are never static , and several unknowns could significantly alter the existing projections . <p> One such factor is how the virus 's spread may be affected by the changing seasons . No firm evidence suggests that the coronavirus will be more or less transmissible in the fall and winter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on human behavior that concerns researchers , particularly because cold weather is likely to draw people indoors and make it difficult to practice social distancing . <p> "" In the winter , people tend to stay inside , which could make it easier to transmit the disease , "" said Sen Pei , an associate research scientist at Columbia University , who has done extensive Covid-19 modeling work . "" But we still do n't know how the virus will perform in the winter . "" <p> Pei said that there were enormous challenges with modeling a novel coronavirus but that with nine months of data from the pandemic , his team 's projections have become significantly more sophisticated . Yet one of the most difficult things to predict in a model is also one of the most important factors that could change the outcome of an outbreak : how humans respond . <p> "" It 's a fluid situation , because people 's behavior changes over time , which is essentially unpredictable , "" Pei said . <p> The uncertainty is partly why Pei and other modelers avoid long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing short-term outlooks for the next four to six weeks . <p> "" Nobody really knows what 's going to happen past the next few weeks , "" said Youyang Gu , a data scientist who runs a coronavirus model known as Covid-19 Projections . Gu , who does n't have a background in epidemiology or infectious disease modeling , designed a model that uses machine learning to "" study "" certain parameters that evolve with the pandemic , such as the virus 's reproduction number , or R-naught , which represents how contagious a disease is . <p> "" We do n't rely on any implicit assumptions , "" Gu said . "" We look at the data and say : This is what we learned from what is happening . "" <p> Gu said his model , which runs forecasts only until November , was able to predict that the surge in new cases in June and July would n't subsequently lead to an equivalent spike in deaths on par with what the country experienced in March and April . <p> "" We compared what happened in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data did n't support deaths ' going up as quickly as cases , "" Gu said . "" We ended up peaking at about 1,000 deaths per day , which is obviously still very significant but less than what a lot of people in the scientific community had been expecting . "" <p> The shift from long-term projections is a desire shared by other modelers , who say long-term projections are often less accurate because they need to include a wide range of estimates to account for uncertainties . By January , for instance , travel bans , lockdowns or other restrictions could be introduced , dramatically altering long-term predictions . <p> The switch "" allows us to get away from these scenario projections that we were initially doing and move closer to forecasting , which is the goal , "" said Shaun Truelove , an assistant scientist and modeling expert at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health . "" The forecasts are more understanding what is really going to happen given the situation , rather than this is what could happen . "" <p> Vespignani likened it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the further out they target .

"<h> Senators : Utility ' woefully ' unprepared for gas explosions <p> BOSTON ( AP ) -- The natural gas company at the center of the explosions north of Boston last month was "" woefully unprepared "" to prevent or respond to the unfolding disaster , Sens . Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey said Friday after a review of internal company documents . <p> The Massachusetts Democrats said Columbia Gas did n't have adequate safety and response measures in place before Sept. 13 , when more than 80 explosions and gas fires struck Lawrence , North Andover and Andover . <p> The explosions , likely caused by overpressurized gas lines , killed one person , injured 25 others , damaged or destroyed dozens of homes , and left thousands of Merrimack Valley residents without natural gas to heat their homes as the winter approaches . <p> Warren and Markey said in an Oct. 4 letter that they had reviewed documents and statements provided by the company , including its Distribution Integrity Management Plan and Operations and Maintenance Manual . <p> Insight by Lookout : Federal security and IT practitioners examine the state of mobile cybersecurity in this exclusive executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly contemplate the possibility that a disaster like this could occur , did not have sufficient safety measures in place to prevent a disaster , and was not prepared to respond . "" <p> The senators also criticized the company for not instituting "" commonsense "" measures -- such as knowing the exact location of control lines and having the proper staff onsite during repair work -- until five days afterward . <p> "" The omission of these sorts of safety measures from Columbia Gas ' operating procedures prior to this disaster is alarming and unacceptable , "" the senators wrote . "" It raises serious questions as to why these policies were not previously in place for Columbia Gas ' systems and whether that failure was the result of negligence , cost considerations , or incompetence . "" <p> Ken Stammen , a spokesman for NiSource , Columbia Gas ' parent company , said the utility ca n't comment on the cause of the incident or matters related to the ongoing National Transportation Safety Board investigation . <p> "" We have been responding to the Senators ' requests for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most recent letter , "" he said in a statement . "" Our attention right now is focused on restoring gas service to customers in the Merrimack Valley . "" <p> Meanwhile , local government officials and Columbia Gas announced Friday they 're offering hotel rooms , travel trailers , shelters and other temporary housing for those without gas service or otherwise unable to return to their homes . <p> Will artificial intelligence replace many federal workers ? <p> At least 15 structures have been deemed uninhabitable , an additional 19 need significant repairs , and an additional 102 sustained minor damage , state officials said this week . <p> Columbia Gas has deployed thousands of workers to replace 45 miles of aging pipeline and gradually restore service . <p> The company says all customers should have gas , including for heat and hot water , by Nov. 19."

"<h> Majority of Canadian Parents Worry Their Children are Falling Behind in Their Studies <p> Survey by Osmo finds more than half of parents are overwhelmed trying to balance homeschooling with work demands <p> TORONTO , April 30 , 2020 /CNW/ - While some parts of the country are starting to loosen restrictions implemented due to COVID-19 , school reopenings are still a long way off leaving parents and caregivers adding the role of teacher to their already laundry list of responsibilities . With new research fromOsmo , provider of fun and engaging educational tools for kids , revealing three in five of these parents having a newfound respect for teachers and 40 per cent stating teachers deserve a pay raise , it 's clear many families are finding homeschooling a challenge . <p> With seventy-one percent of Canadian parents and caregivers still working an average of six hours a day , lack of time is clearly one factor making home education difficult . However , parents are also questioning their ability to teach some subjects to their children . Canadian parents and caregivers ranked mathematics ( 89% ) , reading ( 83% ) and science ( 72% ) as the top three subjects they think are the most important for their child to continue to learn about while at home . However , mathematics and science were the top two subjects that parents felt like they could n't pass should they be tested today . <p> "" It 's clear that Canadian parents and caregivers are doing their best to juggle schooling and work commitments , but it 's not easy - in fact , three in five are concerned their children are falling behind in their studies , "" said Pramod Sharma , CEO and Co-Founder of Osmo . "" Rather than putting all the onus on their own shoulders , I recommend parents look for tools and resources that empower children to learn independently , giving parents some much-needed time back to focus on work . "" <p> Some parents are already turning to a variety of resources to keep their children learning throughout the day , including : workbook and worksheets ( 68% ) ; video conferences with teachers ( 53% ) ; reading aloud ( 40% ) and education television shows ( 38% ) . More than half are finding that games on tablet/mobile devices , such as Osmo , are effective in that they are educational and fun at the same time , so kids enjoy the time they spend learning about math , science , coding , reading and more . This might be the key for the 69% of parents who wish they had more engaging activities for their children . <p> "" We know that the majority of Canadian parents are worried that their children will fall behind on educational milestones with so much time spent at home , "" said Toronto District Schoolboard teacher Luke Persaud . "" Leveraging virtual resources that keep kids learning and the process fun is key , and Osmo 's tools for both families and teachers are a great resource for that . "" <p> Other interesting findings include : <p> Passing the time : the top five activities parents have done with their children since being home include : watching tv/movies ( 90% ) ; school work ( 82% ) ; games on tablet/mobile device ( 74% ) ; drawing ( 53% ) ; and playing outside ( 49% ) <p> Staying on schedule : the country is divided when it comes to creating a daily schedule for children during this time - 53% have a plan while 47% go with the flow <p> Free for all : 59% of kids have between 4 and 7 hours of free time each day <p> Class time : almost half of all parents ( 49% ) dedicate 2 to 3 hours a day for education at home <p> Your attention , please : 1 in 3 parents plan to be more engaged in their child 's education following COVID-19 <p> During the month of May , Osmo for Schools is offering special promotions for teachers , including 50% some items and free shipping to Canada : https : //schools.playosmo.com/ <p> About OsmoOsmo is building a universe of hands-on play experiences that nourish the minds of children by unleashing the power of imagination .

"<h> Facebook Is Giving Away This Speech Recognition Model For Free <h> Read Next <p> Researchers at Facebook AI recently introduced and open-sourced a new framework for self-supervised learning of representations from raw audio data known as wav2vec 2.0 . The company claims that this framework can enable automatic speech recognition models with just 10 minutes of transcribed speech data . <p> Neural network models have gained much traction over the last few years due to its applications across various sectors . The models work with the help of vast quantities of labelled training data . However , most of the time , it is challenging to gather labelled data than unlabelled data . <p> The current speech recognition systems require thousands of hours of transcribed speech to reach acceptable performance . There are around 7,000 languages in the world and many more dialects . It can be said that the availability of the transcribed speech for a vast majority of languages is still negative . <p> To mitigate such issues , researchers open-sourced the wave2vec framework . The framework has the capability to make efficient development in Automatic Speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How wav2vec 2.0 Works <p> The successor of wav2vec model , wav2vec 2.0 model learns basic speech units that are used to tackle a self-supervised task and is trained to predict the correct speech unit for masked parts of the audio while learning the speech units at the same time . <p> wav2vec 2.0 utilises a self-supervision method to push the boundaries by learning from unlabelled training data to enable speech recognition systems for many more languages , dialects , and domains . <p> In technical terms , wav2vec 2.0 masks the speech input in the latent space and solves a contrastive task defined over a quantisation of the latent representations which are jointly learned . <h> Wav2vec 2.0 &amp; Other Models <p> The latent representations are then fed to a Transformer network to build contextualised representations , and the model is trained via a contrastive task where the true latent is to be distinguished from distractors . <p> Also , similar to the famous BERT ( Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers ) model , the new wav2vec 2.0 model is trained by predicting speech units for masked parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that speech audio is a continuous signal that captures many aspects of the recording with no precise segmentation into words or other units . Wav2vec 2.0 tackles this issue by learning basic units that are 25ms long to enable learning of high-level contextualised representations . <p> These units are then used to describe many different speech audio recordings and make wav2vec more robust . This feature helped the researchers to build speech recognition systems that can outperform the best-semi supervised methods , even with 100x less labelled training data . <h> Wrapping Up <p> According to a blog post , with just 10 minutes of transcribed speech along with 53K hours of unlabelled speech , this new model enables speech recognition models at a word error rate ( WER ) of 8.6 per cent on noisy speech and 5.2 per cent on clean speech on the standard LibriSpeech benchmark . <p> In this research , the researchers showed that speech recognition models can be built with very small amounts of annotated data at very good accuracy . According to the researchers , this model has opened the door for speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that previously required loads of transcribed audio data to provide acceptable accuracy . <p> Developers in a blog post stated , "" Wav2vec 2.0 is part of our vision for machine learning models that rely less on labelled data , thanks to self-supervised learning . "" They added , "" We hope that the algorithm will enable improved speech technology for many more languages , dialects , and domains , and lead to improvements for existing systems .

"<h> How LinkedIn came between Microsoft and Salesforce <p> Microsoft and Salesforce are arch-rivals that recently battled each other to buy the social network LinkedIn . <p> by NICK WINGFIELD and KATIE BENNER <p> This is a story of love lost after a fight over social media . <p> Today , Microsoft and Salesforce are arch-rivals that recently battled each other to buy the social network LinkedIn hungry for its troves of highly personalised data about businesspeople . When Microsoft won , Salesforce threw cold water on the acquisition by saying it would violate European anti-monopoly laws . <p> But not long ago , the two software giants were tight . They even talked about merging their businesses not once , but twice . The second round of talks has n't previously been reported . <p> A behind-the-scenes look at the fight between Salesforce , which upended business software by pioneering a rent-by-the-month model , and Microsoft , which is racing to adjust , exposes an awakening in corporate America about the value of social networks like LinkedIn and Twitter . The data stashed in their servers has elevated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that helps big businesses understand their customers . <p> But now that tech giants like Microsoft and Salesforce covet that data , they are finding that only a few companies have it . That 's partly why Salesforce considered bidding recently for Twitter , despite its growth struggles . Microsoft was so eager to have LinkedIn that it agreed to pay $26.2 billion in cash for it , the biggest deal in its history . Salesforce fired back , complaining that Microsoft could use LinkedIn data to increase its control of the business software market . <h> Related Quotes <h> Company Profile <p> At first , Microsoft and Salesforce put past grievances behind them the two had squabbled over patents , employee poaching and more and agreed to make their products work better with each other . Their relationship warmed up when they began to talk about a merger but then quickly got frosty when they could n't agree on a price . <p> There are big personalities behind the battle . At Microsoft , the job of adjusting course has fallen to Satya Nadella , a poetry-quoting chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas like the cloud business applications where Salesforce is a leader . <p> "" Microsoft decided it could go ahead and recreate the best parts of Salesforce , "" said Venky Ganesan , a managing director at Menlo Ventures who has spoken with Nadella and other business-development executives at Microsoft . <p> Marc Benioff , a founder and the chief executive of Salesforce , is considered a self-assured visionary . But he had doubts about staying independent around the time he understood that Microsoft was getting serious about competing with his company . <h> A Budding Friendship <p> Salesforce was founded in 1999 to bring about "" the end of software as we know it , "" as Benioff liked to say . The slogan appealed to Benioff , a former Oracle executive who alternates between the brashness of a Silicon Valley tycoon and the mellowness of a Hawaiian surfer . ( He has a sprawling compound in Hawaii and frequently signs off emails with "" Aloha . "" ) <p> At the time , software used by businesses was usually sold through huge licensing deals for software that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to undercut that model : He would offer the same thing over the internet , without expensive installations , and customers would pay by the month . <p> The idea proved prescient . Though it only recently began turning a profit , Salesforce is on track to have more than $8 billion in revenue this year , representing annual growth of about 25 percent . The total market value of the company is more than $50 billion . Salesforce is the largest tech employer in San Francisco , and the company will move into the city 's tallest building , Salesforce Tower , when it is completed . <p> Salesforce 's main products are for customer relationship management , or CRM , unglamorous tools that are nevertheless critical for helping businesses where it counts : by managing sales leads and client interactions that bring in revenue . Sales in the CRM market totalled $26.3 billion last year , and Salesforce was in the No. 1 spot , with just under 20 percent , according to Gartner , a research firm . Microsoft was in fourth place , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It took Microsoft years to see the potential in what Salesforce was doing . Microsoft had its own CRM product , Dynamics , but it took a back seat inside an empire that , under former chief executive Steven A. Ballmer , was consumed with battling more prominent competitors like Apple , Google and Sony . <p> Nadella , a longtime Microsoft executive whose career odyssey at the company included overseeing its CRM product , was less combative than his predecessor . He began reaching out to leaders of many rival companies after he became chief executive in early 2014 , with a special goal of improving Microsoft 's standing in Silicon Valley . <p> John W. Thompson , a longtime Silicon Valley executive who had recently become chairman of Microsoft 's board , arranged a dinner at the Rosewood hotel in Menlo Park , California , for Nadella to meet other tech executives , including Benioff , the Salesforce chief said in a 2015 interview . "" At the end of dinner , I really gave Satya a number of areas I thought we could work closely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me up on all of them . "" <p> Nadella and Benioff declined to be interviewed for this article . <p> A few months later , the two men had negotiated an agreement to make Microsoft 's Office 365 suite of applications work better with Salesforce 's online services , which they said business customers were clamoring for . They promised more collaborations to come . They began tweeting at each other like old friends . <p> At one point , Benioff offered to buy the Dynamics business that Salesforce competed with , but Nadella turned him down , according to two people briefed on the discussions . <p> The two companies stayed close , and by the spring of 2015 their conversations evolved into another deal : Microsoft would acquire Salesforce . In May 2015 , CNBC reported that the talks had fallen apart because Salesforce was demanding around $70 billion , about $22 billion more than the company 's market value at the time . <p> Several people briefed on the talks said that account was accurate , though two of them said another factor was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building Salesforce . It was unclear whether Benioff would be happy in a subordinate role at Microsoft after building Salesforce from the ground up , and it was equally hard to imagine a successful Salesforce without him . <p> Quickly , there were signs that Microsoft planned to get its act together in the CRM business . As part of a broader shake-up , Nadella moved Dynamics under Scott Guthrie , one of Microsoft 's most respected engineering leaders . This telegraphed that it intended to go after Salesforce 's business . <p> "" They 're serious in a way they have n't been before , "" said Charles Fitzgerald , an angel investor in Seattle and a former Microsoft manager who occasionally consults with the company . <h> Competition Heats Up <p> Salesforce did not sit idle . In November , it hired a former head of Dynamics , Bob Stutz , to oversee its data analytics products . <p> Still , Microsoft and Salesforce had reasons to keep the peace . Nadella wanted Salesforce to use Microsoft 's cloud computing infrastructure , called Azure , to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credibility to Azure as Microsoft tried to catch Amazon , the top cloud infrastructure provider . <p> In September 2015 , Nadella spoke at Dreamforce Salesforce 's annual tech jamboree in San Francisco where Benioff positively gushed over him in his introduction . "" Satya and I have become good friends over the past couple of years , "" he said . "" He is an incredible person , an incredible visionary , an incredible leader of an incredible company . "" <p> In the months after , Benioff met privately with Nadella to talk business . Benioff discussed using Microsoft 's HoloLens augmented reality headset in a Salesforce presentation ; that never panned out . And he again brought up the idea of Microsoft 's acquiring Salesforce , according to several people briefed on the talks . <p> Microsoft seemed less receptive to the idea than before , partly because of Salesforce 's price tag and also because Microsoft had decided to compete more aggressively with its own product , these people said . By February , the discussions were dead , they said . <p> The conversations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Benioff and Thompson , according to two people with knowledge of the relationship . The two men did not speak for months ( although things have since thawed ) . That 's around the time Benioff seemed to recognize the seriousness of the threat posed by Microsoft a well-capitalized competitor , many times the size of Salesforce according to people who discussed the issue with him . <p> The most alluring acquisition target for both companies was LinkedIn . <p> The business social networking site has become an indispensable tool for people to advertise their employment histories and professional achievements . LinkedIn 's enormous database of profiles could be coupled more tightly with CRM systems to help sales representatives close deals , both companies believed . LinkedIn 's data could also be used to strengthen Microsoft products such as Office , one of Microsoft 's most lucrative products . And LinkedIn comes with a steady revenue stream . <p> On Feb. 16 , Nadella met with Jeff Weiner , chief executive of LinkedIn , to talk about existing business relationships between the companies , but the conversation eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LinkedIn filing with securities regulators . Benioff raised the possibility of a Salesforce acquisition of LinkedIn with Weiner almost a month later . <p> For the next several months , Microsoft and Salesforce privately made competing offers for LinkedIn , each sweetening their bids as the competition increased . Bill Gates , Microsoft 's co-founder and a board member , wooed Reid Hoffman , LinkedIn 's founder and chairman , according to the LinkedIn filing . Salesforce code-named its LinkedIn effort Project Burgundy . <p> In mid-June , Microsoft won LinkedIn with a bid of $196 a share , all of it in cash , which provided more certainty for LinkedIn shareholders than the combination of cash and stock that Salesforce was offering . Microsoft has more than $136 billion in cash and short-term investments . Salesforce has less than $1.2 billion . <p> After LinkedIn filed the details of its acquisition process with regulators , Benioff sent an email to the Salesforce board commenting on how the company had nearly beat Microsoft . The message was one of many published by the website DCLeaks.com from the hacked email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a Salesforce board member . <p> "" We were closer than we realized maybe a $105 cash plus $105 stock would have done it ! "" Benioff wrote . "" But we were definitely over our skis ! ! ! ! "" <p> As the prospect of a LinkedIn deal began to dim for Salesforce , the company 's chief legal officer , Burke Norton , sent an email to the board saying the company , as a result , could contemplate a number of other acquisition targets , one of which Demandware it ended up buying . Other possibilities , including Adobe , Box , Tableau and Workday , remain independent , according to a presentation attached to the email , which was published on DCLeaks.com . <p> Benioff has bought at least 10 companies in all . His most expensive purchase , at $2.8 billion , was Demandware , which helps companies run their online shopping sites . One big acquisition , the document software company Quip , took direct aim at Microsoft Office , one of Microsoft 's cash cows . <h> Deal vs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LinkedIn will give Microsoft the edge it seeks in data analytics , machine learning and CRM. software . The company has a history of fumbling big acquisitions , including its disastrous acquisition of Nokia , which ended in a $7.6 billion write-off , after which Microsoft backed away from mobile phones . <p> While Salesforce 's acquisitions and war chest are relatively small , the company highlighted in a presentation to analysts this fall that it had acquired Quip in part to land its co-founder , Bret Taylor , a former Facebook and Google executive . Analysts view Taylor as someone who can weave Salesforce 's pieces into a more competitive company . <p> In the meantime , Benioff cut a deal in May to use primarily Amazon 's cloud computing services , not Microsoft 's . The deal was worth $400 million over four years for Amazon . <p> Microsoft wooed away a big Salesforce customer , HP , in September to use Dynamics . <p> Salesforce began grumbling to regulators in Europe about the LinkedIn deal last month , raising concerns that the agreement would hinder access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfair advantage . Benioff even blasted the deal on Twitter . <p> "" Given Microsoft 's history and existing monopolies , it is sometimes necessary for antitrust enforcement agencies to intervene to ensure that Microsoft is operating in a manner that promotes competition , rather than stifles it , "" said Norton , Salesforce 's chief legal officer . <p> It 's not clear if the complaints will be a problem for the deal , which has already been approved in the United States . <p> In response to Salesforce 's complaints , Microsoft has said it will bring more price competition to the market . But neither company is totally estranged from its rival , and they say they must work together . In a statement , Peggy Johnson , an executive vice president at Microsoft , said that "" while we 'll continue to compete , we look forward to continuing to partner . """
"<p> Today 's post is part of our "" Editor 's Choice "" series where we highlight recent posts published by our sponsors that provide supply chain insights and advice . This week 's post is from Manhattan Associates . <p> The explosion of e-commerce has impacted every part of the supply chain , from distribution centers to inventory and transportation . Manhattan 's podcast , Transportation Disruption , discussed these challenges with industry thought leaders and experts -- you can listen to it here . <p> Fundamentally , supply chains were built on the logistics principles of scale , consolidation and centralization . For decades , they delivered great efficiencies . E-commerce , however , is the antithesis of those principles . Two-day , next-day and same-day delivery promises shifted transportation execution priorities . It ushered in a new set of objectives for speed , for flexibility and for delivery of smaller quantities of goods to exponentially more locations . As companies race to meet consumer expectations , the decision to offer all these different delivery and shipping methods has had a big impact on their bottom line . For example , in 2018 Amazon spent $27.7 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meeting customer delivery expectations , but without Amazon 's deep pockets . <p> In short , satisfying new demands without evolving the supply chain is not sustainable . That 's why companies are taking steps to optimize their transportation networks , utilizing new technologies to meet customer expectations and leverage the advanced science of machine learning to reduce cost so as to compete more efficiently ."

"<h> Mark Carney decries ' unfair ' economic growth <p> Monday , December 12 , 2016 <p> Having been berated by angry Brexiteers after he intervened in the referendum campaign to warn of bumpy times ahead should UK voters opt to leave the EU , the governor might be forgiven for having wished for a lower profile . <p> Last week , however , Carney waded back into controversy when he delivered a thoughtful address in Liverpool University . <p> The governor pointed out that while globalisation and the digital revolution have produced many benefits , they have also caused "" staggering wealth inequalities "" . <p> He went on to observe that "" every technological revolution mercilessly destroys jobs and livelihoods and therefore identities well before the new ones emerge "" . <p> This year will be remembered as the year of the populist political movement and of the overturning of liberal establishments across advanced economies . <p> We have been witnessing the revenge of the forgotten people , those who have been largely passed by . <p> Taking note of this , Carney warned that people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something is done to help those most impacted by technology and by the global financial crisis . <p> To many citizens , "" measures of aggregate progress bear little relation to their own experience .

Shareholders , taxpayers ... paid a heavy price .

Stagnation , in effect . <p> In the authors ' view , "" the key factor driving growth "" is a continued expansion of the labour force of around 2% a year made up of natural population increase , a rise in female participation and a return to net immigration -- in part driven by that old familial homing pigeon instinct . <p> Our economy is almost as open as a beach hut and right now the winds are blowing hard . <p> Without US investment , it is certain that we would never have achieved the economic rebound which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ironic that arguably the greatest threat to Ireland 's foreign direct investment strategy is coming from within that establishment and from large EU nations like France which are eyeing the State 's corporation tax revenue base . <p> The ESRI , in its report , highlights the plan for the implementation of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base -- CCCTB -- across the EU . It considers that the prospect of the introduction of the new system represents the potential for a large negative shock for the Irish economy . <p> The EU certainly surpasses itself when it comes to the invention of clunky names and acronyms . Is it any wonder that the citizens are turned off the great European project ? However , CCCTB is certainly a wolf lurking in sheep 's clothing from an Irish perspective . <p> Its supporters insist it is all about ensuring tax payments are simplified and about limiting the ability of multinationals to move profits so as to avoid taxes . <p> A curb on such activity should be welcomed . Certainly , the pressure is being stepped up as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CCCTB project was relaunched following a five-year hiatus . <p> The ESRI estimates that , should it be introduced , it would represent a double whammy for Ireland . <p> First , it would result in a reduction of almost 5% in foreign investment flows into the country and there would be a drop of close to 6% in the revenue from the investment that was actually attracted . <p> Under the tax reform proposal , sales location would be relevant in determining the divvy out of the revenue . This would favour larger , consumer markers at the expense of countries such as Ireland where productive activity takes place and where the headquarters is typically located . <p> Interestingly , the ESRI estimates that France , followed by Spain and Greece , would benefit most from the changes while Holland , Denmark and Ireland would suffer the most . <p> One suspects that battle lines are only beginning to be drawn .

Accelerating technological innovation is causing people 's attitude to free trade to harden . <p> "" Economists need to clearly acknowledge the challenges we face , "" said Carney . <p> "" There is a need for a rebalancing of monetary and fiscal policy and structural reforms .

"<h> How science can bring about a eureka moment for Indian startups <p> The bonding and the networking between academic institutions , industry and entrepreneurs have to grow speedily and by orders of magnitude . <p> By Tarun Khanna &amp; K Vijay Raghavan <p> Over the past three years , India 's science and technology-focussed startup movement has seen steady improvement in quality and in numbers . Today , new Indian companies are becoming pioneers in a range of domains , like computer science , engineering , medicine , drug discovery and agriculture . They are moving smartly beyond their comfort zone of e-commerce ventures . <p> Policy initiatives that give tax breaks and stimulate intellectual property development are an important impetus for their growth . In addition , GoI 's Atal Innovation Mission ( AIM ) has strengthened the incubators supported by various government science agencies , and has also invested in new ones . There is marked progress on the following fronts : the curation of ideas for entrepreneurs to choose from ; mentoring the teams implementing these ideas through early stages ; helping enterprises succeed by navigating the inevitable challenges that present themselves in a nascent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also getting attention : the flow of scientific input to fuel startups . Science must inform the innovative process . Without that , our startup ecosystem will be competing globally with hands tied behind its back . Our innovations will be restricted to reverse-engineering , reverse-innovating , and so on . Jugaad -- ' band-aid ' creativity in an infrastructure-deficit ecosystem- -- may be a first step , but it 's simply insufficient to get our ecosystem to compete globally on more encompassing fronts . <p> Fortunately , India 's scientific institutions can deliver , built as they are on robust foundations . Despite legitimate concerns about median quality , there is no question that people of extraordinary talent do graduate from our institutions in significant numbers across numerous scientific fields . This has resulted in pockets of high-quality research in our best universities and research institutions . Institutions like the Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ) and the Department of Atomic Energy ( DAE ) have built impressive indigenous capacity in complex areas . <p> Science FundingFinancial support for science has also grown steadily over the past four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at 0.7 % , the 2018 Economic Survey argues for substantial increases and for taking on major missions in basic science . Missions in artificial intelligence ( AI ) , cyber physical systems , supercomputing and bio-pharma have been started , and others like deep ocean exploration are in the offing . <p> Yet , for basic science to be itself constantly invigorated and to invigorate the entrepreneurial ecosystem , two major chasms need to be bridged . First , industry must invest much more in R&amp;D and connect to the startup ecosystem . The cumulative R&amp;D spend of Apple , Amazon , Facebook and Microsoft in 2017 was about $60 billion . This is comparable to the entire US federal government expenditure on all non-defence-related scientific research . <p> India may not be able to leap to this level directly . But we must start by fostering links to ultimately eliminate the mutual incomprehension between science and industry in India . The link of startups to the industrial ecosystem also requires serious attention to the risk capitaldeficit in India . Ultimately , GoI will likely have to backstop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes the risk-return trade-off more attractive to the latter . <p> Community of ScientistsThe second chasm has to do with India 's community of academic scientists . They must now embrace the responsibility of connecting much more to society , industry and the startup ecosystem . The resulting jalebi of connectivity will help provide the energy to our entrepreneurs and , in turn , to the scientists themselves There has been a self-organisation of such jalebis in some locations- -- Bengaluru , Chennai , Hyderabad , Pune , the National Capital Region ( NCR ) , Kanpur . The bonding and the networking between academic institutions , industry and entrepreneurs have to grow speedily and by orders of magnitude . <p> IIT-Madras shows that the task is not impossible . Its research park has grown from a sparsely occupied shell to a huge venture bubbling with interactions . Only a very small part of the major resources for its growth has come from government funds . <p> Bengaluru is strong in IT and biotech , Hyderabad in chemistry , Pune and Chennai in manufacturing . These must be leveraged as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in IIT-Madras on solar power and electric mobility with national missions and with the auto industry again provides an example . As an immediate starting point , India must make it far easier for global talent to work in , and with , Indian institutions and scientists .

"<h> Putting machines in the driver 's seat <h> Self-driving cars : accidents may happen , but a machine behind the wheel is still the more ethical choice , explains Laurie Zoloth . <p> Last September , Uber , the app-based ride service , rolled out a small fleet of self-driving cars in the US city of Pittsburgh . Reporters delivered breathless accounts , largely along the lines of : "" Not me ! I would never opt for a self-driving car ! "" <p> Two things unsettled the reporters . <p> One was the threat to their sense of autonomy . Self-rule is a core value in constitutional democracies , enshrined in a culture that deifies the lone cowboy or the lone driver setting off into the sunset . A car is often one 's first major possession . In the California of my childhood , wide open freeways were an expression of individual choice and power . <p> The other thing that unsettled them was how the machines would act if faced with the "" trolley problem "" . It 's a favourite of every first-year ethics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a set of fixed tracks and the brakes fail . Just ahead of you , a group of five people are crossing the tracks . You can not stop , but you can pull a lever and switch the speeding trolley to a side track . Sadly , there is also a person crossing there . Can you kill the one to save the five ? Most people say yes . Does it matter if the lone person is Einstein , and the five are members of a criminal gang ? Does it matter if the one is your elderly parent and the five are innocent children ? And do you want to make a rule for all trolley operators that it is always better to kill one to save five ? <p> So how does the self-driving car solve this problem ? I asked J. Storrs Hall , a Virginia-based artificial intelligence expert and author who has given machine ethics a great deal of thought . He published a book called Beyond AI : Creating the Conscience of the Machine . <p> Hall thinks the public worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbing utilitarian machine ethics to come up with a solution . They would n't . <p> The trolley problem is just as unsolvable for a machine as it is for philosophers . In his view it 's not actually a moral problem ; it 's a technical problem . You design the machine to cause as few accidents as possible . You test and compare the results with what human drivers actually do . And then you reiterate the process . It does n't need to be perfect ; it only needs to be better . <p> Ultimately , the question for an ethicist is : even with an imperfect algorithm , is the self-driving car a more ethical choice ? <p> Hall and I agree : the answer is a resounding yes . <p> Nearly 1.3 million people die in road crashes each year -- 3,287 deaths a day , on average . An additional 20 to 50 million are injured or disabled . More than half of all road traffic deaths occur among young adults aged 15-44 . About 32% involve alcohol . <p> And that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtless or downright criminal stupidity of drivers . Many other accidents are caused by driving under the influence of drugs , texting while driving or exhaustion . <p> The safety programming on a self-driving car would eliminate the risks imposed by such behaviours . Self-driving cars would also give autonomy to those who currently do n't have it , like the aged and infirm . <p> There are other values to consider . Creating a car that is wildly technologically advanced instead of , for example , creating better public transportation systems is a choice for one sort of world over another . <p> Like any technology , self-driving cars are not perfect . But stopping the needless tragedies on our roads means the choice to develop them is not even a close call . No doubt there will be mistakes and dreadful accidents . But by preventing risky behaviours in the first place , there would undoubtedly be less carnage than we have today . <p> In Hall 's view , the real trolley problem is : how long do you leave the status quo versus speeding up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not- so-distant future , the question for ethicists will be : why did we wait so long to fix this ?"
"<h> Best of 2015 : Here are the best movies of the year <p> A one-armed post-apocalyptic survivor searching for her home . A courageous mother trying to give her boy a normal life under unfathomable circumstances . A willful scavenger standing tall next to the iconic likes of Han and Chewie . <p> These are but a few of the remarkable female characters we encountered in 2015 , a grade-A film year that found a plethora of substantial roles for actresses , as well as some new surprises ( a flinty iPhone-shot feature titled "" Tangerine "" ) and old favorites ( nifty reboots with Rocky Balboa , Mad Max and the "" Star Wars "" crew to name but a few ) . <p> More quality filmmaking awaits in the wings , which has a bearing on this best-of the-year roundup . Some awards-season contenders -- "" 45 Years , "" "" The Revenant "" and "" Son of Saul "" -- have been released in other markets but wo n't hit Bay Area theaters until January , so they were not eligible for this list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here then are my favorites of 2015 : <p> Advertisement <p> 1 . "" Mad Max : Fury Road "" : Veteran director George Miller put the pedal to the floorboard for a maniac post-apocalyptic thrill ride co-driven by one of the screen 's most intriguing female action heroes ever -- the rage-filled Furiosa ( Charlize Theron ) . "" Max "" snapped and popped with eye candy and flashy , daring stunt work , but do n't dismiss it as mere pulp fiction . Dig deep and you 'll find all sorts of heady symbolism and commentary , ranging from politics to feminism . It 's a classic . <p> 2 . "" Spotlight "" : Director Tom McCarthy corralled a gifted ensemble for this no-nonsense drama about a pack of tenacious Boston Globe journalists unearthing the extent of the Catholic Church sex abuse cover-up . With integrity and conviction , this disciplined film epitomizes what the very best of journalism can accomplish . While the reality that print journalism clings to life support might not be a news flash , "" Spotlight "" serves as an urgent reminder that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the platform it takes . <p> 3 . "" Mommy "" : You probably know Xavier Dolan as the hotshot director of Adele 's black-and-white "" Hello "" video . What you might not realize is that at just 26 , he 's an accomplished filmmaker . His "" Mommy "" does everything right , illustrating how a complicated , sexually vibrant woman ( Anne Dorval ) finds herself leading a narrowed-down life as she raises an emotionally volatile son . It sounds routine and obvious , but the execution is anything but as Dolan and Dorval imbue scene after scene with rawness , honesty and passion . <p> 4 . "" Room "" : Yes , it 's about a mother and son held captive for years in a 10-foot-by-10-foot room . Yes , it is harrowing and overwhelmingly sad . But with a gem of a screenplay by Emma Donoghue , who wrote the novel it 's based on , director Lenny Abrahamson presents a beautifully rendered and acted ( especially by Brie Larson ) testament to the enduring power of love and the human spirit . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "" Love &amp; Mercy "" : It sounds contrived and problematic to have one actor ( a standout Paul Dano ) play a young version of troubled Beach Boys ' leader Brian Wilson and another ( John Cusack ) portraying him later in life . But the result is harmonic . "" Love &amp; Mercy "" gracefully shows the agony and the ecstasy of being a deeply troubled -- and exploited -- artist , along with the healing power of love . Expect to be moved . <p> 6 . "" Ex Machina "" : What a year this has been for sci-fi , from "" Mad Max "" to that latest "" Star Wars . "" But Alex Garland 's drama was the brainiest of the bunch , a thought-provoking artificial intelligence drama about a beautiful robot ( a magnetic Alicia Vikander ) facing an existential crisis of sorts . As the genius inventor , Oscar Isaac gave one of the year 's most underrated performances ( and that dance sequence is soooo creepy ) . It 's streaming on Netflix , so get on it ! <p> 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satire about how a group of financial wizards foresaw the subprime mortgage train wreck and lept to made a mint off it is shrewd , funny and makes you mad as hell . Christian Bale , Steve Carell , Brad Pitt and Finn Wittrock certainly sell it . <p> 8 . "" Tangerine "" : Sean S. Baker 's raunchy iPhone-shot comedy about a tempestuous L.A. transgender prostitute wanting to get even with the woman her man 's been hanging out with crackles with electricity and authenticity . But it is Mya Taylor as a singer wannabe who is trying to keep her angry friend from going overboard who steals the film and wins your heart . <p> 9 . "" Straight Outta Compton "" : F. Gary Gray 's massive , engrossing and relevant take on the groundbreaking hip-hop group N.W.A. might hew to biopic traditions , but it 's so well done and stuffed with standout performances and powerful scenes you just do n't mind . It held me in its grip from first scene to last , and that 's saying a lot with a two-and-a-half-hour running time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Awakens "" : Initially , I had quibbles with J.J. Abrams ' reboot , thinking it almost played too much like a greatest-hits of the original trilogy . Then I caught an image of Jar Jar Binks from "" The Phantom Menace . "" Doubts vanished . In one of 2015 's daunting assignments , filmmaker Abrams renovated a broken and bruised "" Star Wars "" franchise . In the process , he gave us a joyous reunion and a kicky new start for fans and newbies . It 's not as good as "" The Empire Strikes Back , "" but this is a satisfying reboot with some nifty new characters , especially Rey ( Daisy Ridley ) , and renewed hope for future installments."

"<p> Huge fleets of Chinese fishing boats have been caught stealthily operating in North Korean waters -- while having their tracking systems turned off . The potentially illegal fishing operation was revealed through a combination of artificial intelligence , radar and satellite data . <p> A study published today in the journal Science Advances details how more than 1,600 vessels of Chinese origin ( over 900 in 2017 and over 700 in 2018 ) likely caught more than 160,000 metric tons -- close to half a billion dollars ' worth -- of Pacific flying squid over two years . This may be in violation of United Nations sanctions , which began restricting North Korea from foreign fishing in September 2017 following the country 's ballistic missile tests . <h> Advertisement <p> Illegal fishing threatens fish stocks and maritime ecosystem , and can also jeopardise food security for legitimate fishers .

"<h> Thanks ! <h> 1/10Style : A Retro Mood <p> A sense of nostalgia was palpable at the 58th edition of the Salone del Mobile furniture fair in Milan . Rounded forms , velvet upholstery and the exuberant use of jewel tones added to the retro feel of the collections . "" We 'll see a lot of curves this year and a lot of nostalgic accents , "" observes Jean Wee , COO of Marquis Furniture Gallery . "" There is a lot of multi-functional furniture ; such as tables that can be used for all different corners of the sofa . "" <h> 2/10Colour : Seeing Red <p> The crimson hue took the interior world by storm this year . The most popular application of the colour : the use of burgundy upholstery fabrics , which turned minimalist seats into statement pieces . A brighter , fiery tone was also applied onto accent pieces such as side tables and stools ; an easy way to bring a touch of this trend into your home . <h> 3/10Shape : The Bauhaus Effect <p> With the centenary celebrations of the Bauhaus movement in full swing this year , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be hugely influential . Its functionalist approach has inspired the light , minimalist silhouettes of several collections on show , with pieces distilled to pure forms . These geometric shapes have also been incorporated onto patterns used on upholstery fabrics , rugs , decorative vases and other objets d'art. <h> 4/10Material : Fashionable Twist <p> Upholstery textiles can instantly change the look of your furniture ; a detail that 's much evident at Salone del Mobile . "" In Milan recently , furniture is having a fashion moment with more frills , bold patterns ; wall panelling is really bold , "" says Jennifer Murray , creative director of The I.D . Dept . "" There 's a lot more play with textures and bolder colours . "" Chairs and sofas were dressed in a plethora of fabrics that took cues from the fashion runways : these include the use of boucle , tweed , horsehair and animal prints on stylish seats spotted throughout the fair . <h> 5/10Style : Outdoors In <p> With the blurring of boundaries between indoors and out , it seemed only natural that outdoor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its first outdoor collection at the fair ; top picks include the Vulcano seating system designed by Antonio Citterio . Citterio also created the Ribes outdoor collection for B&amp;B Italia , which features sofas , armchairs and daybeds in a variety of shapes and sizes ; the stripe upholstery fabric adds to its relaxed look . <p> Minotti also continued to grow its outdoor selection , which has been designed to be used for luxury yachts and hotels as well as in residential settings . New pieces include tables , seats and accessories added to the Quadrado modular system by Marcio Kogan of Studio mk27 . First launched in 2018 , the system is distinguished by its teak duckboard design ; a feature that draws influence from the boating world . <p> The Primordial bookcase by Raphael Navot for Roche Bobois , from Roche Bobois at Boon Siew Building <h> 6/10Finish : Raw Textures <p> The juxtaposition between man-made features and natural elements continue to intrigue ; this is manifested in the popularity of rugged surfaces on furniture which add a tactile touch to each design . <p> Technological advancements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural materials ; pieces made with ceramic and engineered wood feature unconventional shapes and concrete-like finishes . This can be seen in myriad collections showcased at the fair , including the Nativ range authored by Raphael Navot for Roche Bobois . The Primordial bookcase ( seen above ) is a key example of the collection 's preoccupation with organic shapes and hand-carved details ; its oblong , sculptural form is made of moulded polyurethane with a rock-like finish . <h> 7/10Material : Plastic Fantastic <p> The eco-conscious use of plastics continues as furniture makers and designers respond to climate change while minimising wastage . These include the Emeco On and On collection by Barber Osgerby ; 70 per cent of each seat is made of recycled PET bottles while the other 30 per cent comprises of non-toxic pigment and glass . <p> Another eco-conscious highlight is the Kartell A.I. chair . French architect Philippe Starck worked with software company Autodesk to create a chair designed by artificial intelligence -- the machine was instructed to design a durable chair that uses as little material as possible , while employing creative thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Precious Things <p> Marble has long been the preferred choice for luxurious table tops , with varieties such as the Calacatta marble and Statuario marble being perennial favourites . This year , brands such as Visionnaire incorporated a wide range of natural stone in its collections ; a design detail that draws influence from the glamorous shine of jewellery pieces . These include the use of onyx , applied on the Kylo dining table as well as decorative lighting pieces such as the Moon-eye lamp . <h> 9/10Form : New Division <p> Spaces and furniture are becoming more multifunctional to adapt to the limited square footage in urban homes . In response to this , furniture manufacturers have created ingenious , space-optimising solutions that are mindful of these limitations while utilising their unique expertise . These include the Gliss master wardrobe system designed by Vincent Van Duysen for Molteni&amp;C , which now features the Sistema 7 opening mechanism ; a patented system comprising horizontally folding doors that can be moved to the side of each compartment . These doors enable the wardrobe system to function as a partition between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit within a master bedroom . <p> Manufacturers such as Boffi also showcased new interior solutions , in the form of partition doors and wall systems that improve spatial flow within modern homes . The Quadra collection created by Massimo Luca for ADL -- a manufacturer that 's part of the Boffi Group -- features pivoting or sliding doors in extruded aluminum alloy with a central tempered glass frame ; these can function as doors or moveable walls . <p> For smaller spaces , the Arflex Vela screen is a top pick , now available in more shapes and colourways. <h> 10/10Material : Wood Works <p> In response to the human desire to reconnect with nature , designers have increasingly incorporated natural materials such as wood in interior furnishings . The new collections presented during Milan Design Week were no exception . These inventive designs feature geometric detailing and slim profiles that also highlight the beauty of the unique grain pattern found on each piece . <p> Conscious of the limitations of our natural resources , furniture manufacturers have also harnessed modern techniques to minimise material wastage . These include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the Kingwood armchair and ottoman . It pairs a plywood frame in ash or striped rosewood ; the seat can be upholstered in fabric or leather . <p> The 58th edition of Salone del Mobile Milano and the Fuorisalone satellite events were held from 9-14 April during Milan Design Week ; visit salonemilano.it for more information ."

As autonomous technology gets ready for introduction on public roads , "" there are many areas where we can deploy early , "" he said . Geofenced and highly structured environments are some of those areas , he added . <p> Nvidia said its full software stack for sensor processing , perception , map localization and path planning allows a wide range of possible autonomous driving applications .

"<p> Welcome back to This Week in Apps , the TechCrunch series that recaps the latest OS news , the applications they support and the money that flows through it all . <p> The app industry is as hot as ever , with a record 204 billion downloads and $120 billion in consumer spending in 2019 . People are now spending three hours and 40 minutes per day using apps , rivaling TV . Apps are n't just a way to pass idle hours -- they 're a big business . In 2019 , mobile-first companies had a combined $544 billion valuation , 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus . <h> Top Stories <h> Quibi dies ... and no one was surprised <p> There was so much wrong with Quibi 's premise that it 's sometimes hard to even know where to start . But at the core , its problem was that it fundamentally misunderstood how , when and why users would watch video on their phones . <p> The company 's thinking was that you could fund high-production value content ( $100K/minute , yikes ) then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a technology layer , then call this a reinvention of cinema . <p> When people want to appreciate high-quality filmmaking ( or even TV production ) , they tend to want a bigger screen -- they 've spent money for their fancy high-def or 4K TV , after all . Pre-COVID , they might even pay to go a movie theater . On mobile , the production value of content is far less of a concern , if it even registers . <p> Quibi also misunderstood what users want to watch in terms of video on their phones when they have a few minutes to kill . <p> By positioning its app in this space , it had to compete with numerous and powerful sources for "" short-form "" content -- existing apps like YouTube , TikTok , Facebook ( e.g. News Feed content , Watch feeds ) , Instagram Stories , Snapchat and so on . This is content you do n't have to get invested in , since you 're just distracting yourself from a few minutes of boredom . It 's not a time or place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Quibi also cut the length of content to serve its artificial limitations -- at the expense of story quality and enjoyment . <p> A reality show dumbed down to just its highlights is almost unwatchable , as it exposes the editors ' machinations and manipulations that are better hidden among longer stretches of fluff . And there was simply no reason to cut down movies -- like Quibi 's "" The Dangerous Game , "" for example -- into pieces . It did n't elevate the storytelling ; it distracted from it . And if you wanted a quick news update ( e.g. Quibi 's "" Daily Essentials "" ) , you did n't need a whole new app for that . <p> Quibi content may have been considered "" high quality , "" but it often was n't good . ( I still ca n't believe I sat through an episode of "" Dishmantled , "" where chefs had to recreate dishes of food that were thrown in their face . And Quibi had the nerve to shame YouTube 's low-quality and lack of talent ? ! ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but its catalog was n't designed for families , with content that ranged from kids to adult programming . It did n't offer parental controls . This immediately limited its competitiveness . <p> At launch , Quibi also limited itself to the phone , which meant it limited your ability to use the phone as a second screen while you watched a show . ( There was no PiP support ) . TechCrunch hasbeenwriting about phones as the second screen for the better part of a decade , often with a focus on startups . But in Quibi 's case , it killed the second screen experience , seemingly forgetting that people text friends , order food , check Twitter and peek in on other apps while a TV show plays in the background . Did it really think that a reboot of "" Punk 'd "" deserved our full attention ? <p> Quibi naturally blamed COVID for its failure to thrive . It had imagined a world where users had ample time to kill while out and about : commuting on the subway , standing in long lines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was flawed . It would have eventually caught up to Quibi , too ; COVID just accelerated it . The issue is that Quibi imagined the U.S. as only a swath of urban metros where public transportation is abundant and standing in lines is the norm . In reality , more than half ( 52% ) the U.S. is described as suburban , 27% is urban and 21% is rural . Non-urban commuters often drive themselves to work . Sure , they could stream Quibi during those commutes , but not really look at it . So why burn high-production value on them ? And standing in long lines , believe it or not , is not actually that common in smaller cities and towns , either . If it only takes two minutes to grab a coffee or a burrito before you hop back in your car , do you really want to start a new show ? <p> So where would that have left Quibi ? Hoping for Gen Z'ers attention as they lounge around their bedrooms looking for something to do ? And yet it wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even know ? As COVID pressed down , it left Quibi in competition with ( often arguably better ) content that streamed natively on the TV from apps like Netflix , HBO , Hulu , Prime Video , Disney+ , and others where you could binge through seasons at once instead of waiting every week for a new "" quick bite "" to drop . <p> There 's more , so much more that could still be said , including the fact that a former eBay and HP CEO may not be the right person to lead a company that wanted to dazzle a younger demographic . Or how its video-flipping TurnStyle feature was clever , but added complexity to filmmaking , and was not enough of a technological leap to build a business around . Or how , no matter how much money it had raised , it was still not enough , compared with the massive budgets of competitors like Netflix and Amazon . <p> You can read a further post-mortem round-up here . And another here .

Snap 's net loss of $200 million was a 12% improvement over last year , too . <p> During earnings , the company touted it now reaches 90% of the Gen Z population and 75% of millennials in the U.S. , U.K. and France . User growth was attributed to new products , including Profiles , Minis , Lens creation tools and AR ads .

What was once merely the moniker for fans of a romantic relationship between Rey and Kylo Ren has , in fits and starts , become a heated war between people for and against it . <p> Reylo has grown beyond typical fandom shipping and , like a lot of Star Wars discourse in recent history , evolved into a buzzword that often brings with it toxic and harassment-laden levels of intra-fandom spatting . <p> That 's on either side of the debate , too , whether it 's particularly fervent supporters of the pairing ( and through it , a path to Ben Solo 's redemption ) demanding that the final film in the Skywalker Saga make it the series endgame . <p> Or , on the other end , it 's the equally fervent detractors who see supporting a relationship between the light-side-aligned heroine and the dark-side villain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of making the female lead 's story arc hinge around romance , but a potential normalisation of abusive relationships ( Kylo Ren has , of course , literally tortured Rey multiple times ! ) . <p> Both fans and creatives involved with the saga -- from authors to actors like Daisy Ridley herself -- have faced abuse over whether or not they support the pair , or for even acknowledging that the mere potential of the pairing could exist in the films , and it 's a topic of debate that has only gotten more intense the closer we get to The Rise of Skywalker 's December release . <p> Which is why it 's interesting to see Daisy Ridley tell Entertainment Weekly in a new interview that the film will not only provide definitive answers about Rey and Kylo Ren 's relationship , but also address Reylo directly as something neither she or the movie treats as some fannish kerfuffle the film could never deign to comprehend . <p> "" It does not bother me , people writing theories , "" Ridley told the outlet . "" It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's sort of going to happen , I think it 'll be really interesting to see people 's reaction to the final film . Obviously , there 's this whole Reylo thing and some people are very passionate about it , some are n't .... J.J. does deal with it . It 's a very complex issue . People talk about toxic relationships and whatever it is . It 's no joke and I think it 's dealt with really well because it 's not skimmed over . "" <p> Now , that 's not Ridley saying that Reylo fans will get the outcome they desire . Rey and Ben 's relationship could just as easily be addressed by her shutting a more literal door in his face this time than the closing of the Millennium Falcon 's entrance gangway was meant to represent in The Last Jedi 's climax . <p> It could be addressed by her putting a lightsaber through his chest ( it 's like poetry , it rhymes ) . But her commentary does not definitively rule out that The Rise of Skywalker could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either . <p> But regardless of however The Rise of Skywalker deals with Reylo , the fact that it does -- and that Ridley does not immediately dismiss the notion of it just because it 's a thing fans talk about -- is surprisingly refreshing to hear . So often concepts like this are tossed around in the press and in interviews as something too silly or squicky to discuss , as if concerns from fans ( whether for fan theories or for Reylo , specifically , in this regard ) are n't worth reassuring or acknowledging . <p> As typically heteronormative as a romantic relationship like Rey and Kylo being Rise 's emotional focus would be , at least we know that the concept of it is being explicitly and directly addressed and "" dealt with , "" as Ridley puts it , in the movie . <p> Which is far more refreshing to hear than , say , the repeated "" wait and see "" -ing , "" please understand "" -ing when it comes to whether or not the mainline Star Wars films will finally acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LGBTQ+ characters , or the revelation that characters we 've already met are LGBTQ+ . <p> You know , instead of dancing around it with two minor aliens in a kid 's TV show and then casually trying to act like it was people 's fault for not asking directly enough . Or saying that such representation exists , just not in the text . <p> But that 's a story for another time ! The story right now , at least , is that when December 19 rolls around , there will be an answer either way as to whether or not Reylo is a no-go . <p> As video games give players more freedom to explore complex digital worlds , it becomes more challenging for a CG character to naturally move and interact with everything in it . So to prevent those awkward transitions between pre-programmed movements , researchers have turned to AI and deep learning to make video game characters move almost as realistically as real humans do ."

"<h> Your Holiday Impulses are the Stuff of On-Demand Logistical Nightmares <h> Share <h> Your Holiday Impulses are the Stuff of On-Demand Logistical Nightmares <p> Getty Images <p> One of the best things about holidays is breaking your usual routine . Get up late , stay out late , make plans late -- whatever . Hey , wait , it 's 4 pm on July 3 and no one bought buns or Solo cups for the Independence Day cookout ? ! What 's that app that delivers stuff on short notice ? <p> You may have been watching July 4 approach in anticipation of a well-earned break , but a special category of math-literate Americans views the impending holiday very differently . For those in the business of promising to get people things like rides or emergency Solo cups at the tap of an app , the prospect of the nation varying its usual patterns is enough to bring on a cold sweat . "" Everything becomes super , super chaotic , "" says Jeremy Stanley , vice president of data science at grocery delivery service Instacart . "" The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , Stanley and his number-crunching cohort face a nation-scale sociological problem . If you give people a midsummer Tuesday off work , what will they do more and less of , and where and when will they do it ( or not ) ? <p> As July 4 draws near , Instacart has been augmenting its usual 14-day forecast of hourly order volume for the regions it serves with data from past holidays and tips from grocery stores it works with . Postmates , which delivers groceries , food orders , and even alcohol , has done a similar exercise to revise its own demand prediction models . It has also been running an unusual robo-call campaign , in which a recorded message asks local businesses to punch in what their hours will be over the long holiday weekend . "" We want to make sure we will be able to deliver you those last-minute napkins , "" says Enu Hertzberg , director of product at Postmates . <h> Burger Forecast <p> The way July 4 moves around in the week makes it harder to plan for than some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is almost philosophical . "" We have to ask : Does Tuesday become Sunday ? Is Monday a Saturday ? "" Stanley says . But a day off in July also comes with some certainties . Hertzberg of Postmates expects healthy orders for burgers and napkins over the next few days ; the summer surge in orders for Corona will likely continue before tailing off come fall . ( Ramen orders are down , but should come back in winter . ) Last year Instacart saw a big spike in demand for chips and condiments alongside a slump in requests for granola bars and yogurt , and it seems a fair bet the pattern will repeat . <h> Related Stories <p> As fascinating as our impulsive holiday behavior is , it also cuts right to the heart of the business challenge facing on-demand startups .

"" Consumer patience is low for bad service . "" <p> The millions of venture capital dollars riding on these problems has created a new industry in trying to figure them out . Postmates hired a new executive to lead and expand its data science and machine learning team late last year , for example .

But they claim to be learning to understand our holiday behavior fast . "" I expect our July 4 to outperform our Memorial Day , and for that to outperform Thanksgiving , "" says Elzberg of Postmates . If your ride or hot dog order does n't arrive quite as fast as you 'd hoped this holiday , spare a thought for the logisticians trying to make it quicker next time ."
"<h> Is artificial intelligence a threat to human jobs ? <h> Tuesday November 5 2019 <p> Advertisement <p> By Detricia Pamba @TheCitizenTz ddetricia@yahoo.com <p> If you could have told anyone from the past centuries that we would be able to communicate in video calls , they would most likely tell you that you are in your fantasy , but years later , with the help of technology , we are able to enjoy a simpler life , having machines do everything for us ; calculate for us , wash our clothes , communicate better and much more -- a fully automated life . <p> While technology has evidently improved human lives , the more it keeps advancing , the more it poses a threat to humans -- in as far as our jobs are concerned . The concept of Artificial Intelligence termed as ' AI ' , and also known as ' the fourth industrial revolution ' is now becoming a much more familiar concept , while also raising debates and concerns over its implications towards human jobs . <p> By definition AI can be described as a branch of computer science that emphasizes the development of intelligence machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of speech recognition , problem-solving , learning and planning . If you think AI is something that we should worry more in the future , you might be right , but these machines are already here and maybe you are already using one of them , from Tesla , to Alexa and even SIRI on your apple gadgets , AI is everywhere . <p> Where does it come from ? <p> Although it is highly recognizable in the recent years , the concept of AI goes way back to the Second World War where they used an enigma code to send messages and a bombe machine was used to decipher these codes . It is also said that in 1951 a machine known as Ferranti Mark 1 used an algorithm to master checkers . By 1956 , American computer scientist John McCarthy organized the Dartmouth Conference , at which he coined the term ' Artificial Intelligence , ' from there , many researches started to skyrocket . <p> Since the rise of AI , there has been a state of uneasiness in the job market , with people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played by automated machines . People fear that machines will replace them at work . But the CEO of a tech company in Tanzania -- SmartCodes , Edwin Bruno does n't fully agree with the concept , rather , he says "" If we build machines to be smart , we as humans should also be smarter . "" <p> In an interview with Success , Bruno says that the digital era only tries to simplify human work , enabling us to work better since we created the machines . <p> "" In my opinion , AI looks to simplify human work without human interaction . AI ca n't take all of our jobs , but we humans should become more creative . Just like how we created AI , we should be creative enough to create new opportunities that will fill the divide created with the coming of AI , "" added Bruno . <p> Despite that , he agrees with the fact that AI can be more reliable and efficient than human effort , hence we do need it , but should be able to fully control it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benjamin Fernandes , who said that despite AI 's ability to fully understand customer requests , it does n't necessarily mean that it is replacing human jobs , but rather it 's another opportunity to create more jobs . <p> "" I think one of the main replacements would be seen in customer care service agents . A well-trained AI system can understand customer requests in English and Swahili . This translates into faster responses , and optimal efficiency in answering questions . This would save businesses some money on overhead costs . However , that being said , I do n't think we should look at AI as a ' replacement ' for human jobs , but rather an opportunity to realize there are new types of jobs that are going to be created . I think there will be a stream of new business opportunities empowering entrepreneurship and creativity in the AI space and this is what excites me , "" opines Fernandes . <p> Sophia Abeid , an Electronics and Telecoms Engineer , who 's a Co-Founder of blueprint innovations , says technology helps people to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , by using technology we have managed to help orgnaisations monitor and locate documents using a software linked to google maps in real time , "" she says . <p> She adds that misplacing and losing of important files , which can be caused by human errors , will not be an issue thanks to the help of tech . <p> How should humans prepare to deal with the rise of AI ? <p> It is no doubt that AI is on the rise , but it is also undoubtedly both a threat and an opportunity . Is there hope for a co-existence environment ? That 's up to humans to decide . Nevertheless , with all the back and forth with the technology , how can humans prepare for the rise of AI ? SmartCodes ' Bruno suggests that we should look beyond the creation of AI to seize opportunities that come with it . <p> "" We should look forward to what is next after creating AI . We need to be more innovative in order to be successful in creation of more jobs , we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people should n't be scared but should work on better understanding how to co-exist and work together with AI , the productivity levels would increase . <p> "" I think those in emerging markets should pay more attention . Not to be scared but to be aware , understand and know how AI can support the work we all do . I think there is a fine line between the inter-sections of what we believe should be controlled by technology vs human decisions , "" says Fernandes . <p> Whether AI will steal all our jobs in the future or not still remains to be answered , but what is necessary is to allow technology advancement to happen , while at the same time learn how to control technology so that it can work for us and not against us."
