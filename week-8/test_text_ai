"<h> In the pursuit of FPS : how AMD and Nvidia are tackling PC gaming optimization <h> Cold , hard math vs adding a human touch <p> Over the last few years PC gaming has become significantly more approachable to the everyday gamer , thanks to a combination of more affordable hardware and the availability of discounted digital game libraries through places like Steam and Green Man Gaming . <p> While the price has gone down for both PC hardware and titles , more recently Nvidia and AMD have tried to alleviate even more gamer headaches with optimization software . To this end , Nvidia opened its GeForce Experience beta to the public in January , and AMD launched its Raptr-powered Gaming Evolved application in September . <p> On the surface , the two applications almost seem cut from the same cloth . Both simplify the process of downloading new graphics card drivers to a one-click software update . Similarly , the software packages also set all your graphics settings following some basic guidelines that prioritize a faster frame rate or greater visual fidelity . <p> Continuing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explicit purpose to help fine tune visual settings for less tech savvy gamers . After all , not everyone knows the difference between tessellation ( the splitting of polygons ) and ambient occlusion ( the way light radiates and reflects ) to save their overheating GPU as the FPS craters . <p> While the two apps are much the same in nature and purpose , that 's where their commonalities end . We recently spoke with Nvidia and Raptr , the online gaming partner that powers AMD 's Gaming Evolved app , to uncover how each are figuring out PC optimization and what they might have in store for the gaming masses in the future . <h> The numbers game <p> Raptr is a 7-year old game tracking service that helps users keep tabs on how long they 've been playing games . Beyond clocking hours it 's also an online community site that ties together users ' Xbox , PlayStation Network , and PC gaming accounts for those achievement/trophy obsessed . <p> AMD and Raptr breakdown graphics settings into simple values <p> Raptr CEO Dennis Fong explained that although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not actually that much further than what Raptr was already doing . The company itself tracks over 2,000 computer games with more than 20 million users . It also uses technology that can tell whether gamers were playing a single or multiplayer title , what games they 've installed and what hardware makes up their rigs . <p> In a micro-sized version of the Raptr service , AMD 's Gaming Evolved pulls crowdsourced data from a user base edging over one million . <p> "" The way we designed the system is we actually know what types of PC hardware configurations people are using , "" Fong explained . "" We know what frame rates they are actually getting and we capture all that data every single time you play . "" <p> He continued : "" Every single time you play , it records a FPS histogram of your game session . We can tell if you 're playing a single player or multiplayer session .

Once our machine learns that , it then rolls that recommendation out to everyone else . "" <p> "" What we 're trying to do is find experts , "" he went on . "" The gamers out there that go to all the tech sites and tweak their settings . The beauty of our system is we capture all of that knowledge automatically . """
"<h> Car companies should be very scared of Apple , Google and Tesla <p> This year 's Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) in Las Vegas could have almost been a motor show . From the endless booths of automotive-related products to massive car company displays , the entire and extremely massive show had a very heavy auto skew . <p> The reason for that is simple : As the revolution of electric cars , connected cars and autonomous cars finally begins to take shape , tech companies are invading the automotive sector . Soon , your car will stop being little more than a dumb motor attached to some wheels . <p> The tech giants charging full-steam ahead into the very lucrative automotive sector are the likes of Apple , Google , Uber and even Nvidia -- once little more than a specialist in video graphics . These are the new rivals that should be keeping automotive executives up at night . <p> They have cash , lots and lots of cash , and need to spend it on something . Apple was even reported at one point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put things in perspective , the Cupertino-based company has a market capitalisation of USD $630 billion ( $860 billion ) . Likewise , Google is worth USD $566 billion ( $776 billion ) . <p> Compare that with General Motors and Ford , which are at around USD $50 billion ( $68 billion ) each , and the Nissan , Renault and Mitsubishi alliance that come in at around half of that combined -- and things begin to look a little bleak for traditional car makers as they face the biggest change and challenge in their history . <p> Realistically , Apple and Google could buy a controlling stake in Ford , GM , Renault-Nissan Alliance and even Volkswagen ( $100 billion ) , combined , with their existing free cash ( held comfortably in Ireland ) . The point is the car makers are facing competition from companies that work on much higher margins and can afford to spend billions on R&amp;D without any return . <p> But while Apple and Google know how to make a pretty good phone , they arguable have no idea how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its digital integration and connected-car services fail to come even close to the functionality of a modern smartphone . <p> The game has turned into how fast car companies can learn to make autonomous technology with artificial intelligence that works versus how quickly tech companies can learn to make cars and deploy their far more mature digital technologies and artificial intelligence systems . <p> Google 's deep learning system is something that many do not know about nor understand , but it represents the future of artificial intelligence . At a recent talk by a very senior Google executive in Sydney , the term ' autonomous vehicle ' was used so many times that it became annoying . <p> Google has changed its entire focus to artificial intelligence and the world will change because of it . Do n't think for one second that Google and Apple are content making a better search engine or nicer phones and computers -- they are looking to grow , and that 's partly inspired by some crazy guy called Elon Musk . <p> Speaking of which , if you believe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Renault and Mitsubishi combined and just 25 per cent less than Ford or General motors . Think about that for a minute . Tesla makes fewer than 100,000 cars a year and the newly combined Renault Nissan Mitsubishi group make almost 10 million -- and , yet , the trio is worth about half Tesla 's value . <p> Forgetting valuations for a minute , the arrival of the tech giants and Tesla should be scaring the hell out of car companies . Sure , the argument in their favour goes : "" We 've been doing this for more than a 100 years and cars are very complicated and regulated -- making a car is far more complicated than making a gold iPhone . "" <p> That argument is one I 've made myself before and it has some validity . Except for one thing : cars and mobility as we know it is rapidly changing . No doubt all the already mentioned car companies know how to make a great internal combustion engine , but why did it take Tesla to bring everyday electric cars to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autonomous driving technology that was more than just a concept ? <p> Some random upstart that has been ' mass producing ' cars only since 2008 . Two thousand and freaking eight ! I remember 2008 , it was like a few weeks ago . Tesla achieved both of these feats before any of the established manufacturers and , while it definitely has some ways to go to match the build quality of the old guard , it 's not exactly decades behind . <p> A very senior German BMW executive recently told me that Tesla 's first-to-market success is due to the company not testing its products nearly as much as they do . Sure , that might be true ( if something of an overstatement ) , but it also highlighted the weakness of car companies . They run like giant political corporations , overwhelmed by bureaucracy -- while Tesla , Apple and Google operate like tech companies , where things happen at a much faster rate and with far leaner processes . <p> All of these companies , be it vehicle manufacturers or technology giants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspectives . Google and Apple are stealing car company staff like it 's going out of fashion in the hope of dazzling the market with their own product . Whether that 's an actual car or the software for the car seems to change every week . <p> Meanwhile Uber and Ford envision a future where car sharing becomes a far bigger norm and Nvidia , best known for making pretty graphics a possibility , is now making a great deal of the hardware that drives the Tesla Autopilot system and is seeking to position itself as the Bosch of the new automotive era by producing commoditised artificial intelligence and vision processing systems . Shares in the company have gone up by more than 400 per cent in the last 12 months . <p> The atmosphere around the autonomous driving systems is electric . Every auto maker wants to have the best system and yet , they were all beaten by some American upstart . <p> Nissan and Volkswagen made big deals about their autonomous vehicle technologies at this year 's CES . Nissan with its man-in-the-middle approach ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their own . They need a human monitoring them , Nissan says , so that when things get complicated , someone can dial in and help the car 's artificial intelligence out . Well , is that even an autonomous car anymore ? <p> More to the point , during the live demo of its new Nissan SAM , the system froze . Twice . The autonomous car was stuck and no one was coming to help . Nissan blamed it on a failed satellite link , which highlighted the lack of a backup solution . Really ? It has such an obvious single point of failure and no one thought a backup would be a good idea ? <p> Volkswagen had a similar failure demonstrating its own autonomous vehicle technology . Meanwhile , Tesla 's Autopilot 2 system is in the hands of 1000 customers , being tested in the real world right now . <p> To be fair , Mercedes appears to be the only brand that is keeping in reach of Tesla , with its own autonomous car technology set to launch this year and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , E and C-Class . <p> It 's worth noting that Mercedes bought a 9.1 per cent stake in Tesla in May 2009 , before it went public , for an estimated $50m . It disposed of its shares in October 2014 , making a cool $780m -- and both companies learnt a fair bit along the way . <p> The biggest advantage that tech companies have over the vehicle manufacturers , however , is n't just a more innate understanding of artificial intelligence and connected devices . It 's mapping . <p> Google and Apple maps are the two leading mapping systems in the world ( Apple map jokes aside , the system has improved substantially over the years ) . Do you think Google 's Street View and Google Earth features were developed as a user-focused visual treat or side hobby for the company 's CEO ? No . In order for autonomous cars to work properly , accurate mapping data is vital . It 's why BMW , Mercedes-Benz and Audi jointly purchased Nokia 's Here map system last year . The race is on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here we are . Two industries are about to clash . The car as we know it is about to change more than anyone can predict . Carlos Ghosn , the CEO of Renault-Nissan and now Mitsubishi alliance said that the emergence of electric cars , autonomous cars and connected cars will see more change in the automotive industry in the next decade than we 've seen in the last 50 years . He likened it to the revolution from horse-and-carriage to the car ."

"<p> SAP wants businesses struggling to keep up with the pace of innovation in its HANA in-memory database to relax as it readies a new version , to be known as HANA 2 . <p> Since introducing HANA in 2010 , SAP has been releasing updates twice a year , providing customers with new capabilities but also pushing them to keep their software current to benefit from continuing support . <p> The new version gives businesses two reasons to relax , according to Marie Goodell , vice president of product marketing at SAP . <p> HANA 2 is designed to simplify things for the IT department , reducing the effort it takes to keep the lights on so that businesses can spend more time working on new , next-generation applications that take advantage of new types of data , she said .

Notable treatment-related complications include hypotension , cramps , insufficient blood flow , and arrhythmia . Most complications are associated with unstable blood pressure during HD . Physicians are devoted to seeking solutions to prevent or lower the incidence of possible complications . With advances in technology , big data have been obtained in various medical fields . The accumulated dialysis records in each HD session can be gathered to obtain big HD data with the potential to assist HD staff in increasing patient wellbeing . We generated a large stream of HD parameters collected from dialysis equipment associated with the Vital Info Portal gateway and correlated with the demographic data stored in the hospital information system from each HD session . We expect that the application of HD big data will greatly assist HD staff in treating intradialytic hypotension , setting optimal dialysate parameters , and even developing an intelligent early-warning system as well as providing individualized suggestions regarding dialysis settings in the future . <h> Background &amp; Summary <p> The global population with end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) is increasing annually . Hemodialysis , which provides the excellent , rapid clearance of solutes , is the most commonly used renal replacement therapy for those who need dialysis . Blood pressure ( BP ) variation is frequently encountered and is associated with most complications during regular hemodialysis ( HD ) 1 . Both intradialysis hypotension and hypertension have strong implications for adverse outcomes , including increased cardiovascular events and overall morbidity and mortality2,3,4,5 . A few observational studies have confirmed the "" U-shaped "" or "" reverse J-shaped "" relationship between BP and mortality in a variety of ESRD cohorts6,7,8 . <p> However , dialysis-associated hypotension is considered to be a frequent complication ranging from 5.6 to 76.7% at each HD session and may contribute to considerable symptom burden9.One report has shown that 75% of HD patients had at least one episode of hypotension10 . Another study revealed that more than 50% of treatments were complicated by intradialytic hypotension11 . Intradialytic hypotension is associated with older patients with diabetes and lower predialysis BP and longer dialysis vintage3,10 . Although the exact mechanisms are poorly understood , the possible mechanisms include an increased left ventricular mass index , extracellular volume overload , sympathetic overactivity , sodium loading from dialysate , and the use of antihypertensive medications during HD12,13,14,15,16,17 . <p> The decrease in blood volume occurring during the initial dialysis process can result in hypotension . The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative ( KDOQI ) guidelines define intradialytic hypotension as a decline in systolic BP ( SBP ) ? &gt; ? 20 ? mmHg or a decrease in the mean arterial BP ? &gt; ? 10 ? mmHg associated with symptoms18 . However , because symptoms and intervention data are often unavailable in large databases , some intradialytic hypotension definitions are exclusively based on SBP measurements19 . Patients with hypotension might experience muscle cramps , nausea , vomiting , yawning , sighing , lightheadedness and hoarseness before the decline in BP18 . These symptoms are easily overlooked during the regular dialysis process . Individuals with severe hypotension might develop vascular access thrombosis and experience inadequate dialysis or even bowel ischemia but not cardiovascular events20,21 . <p> A number of strategies have been suggested to prevent the risk of intradialytic hypotension11 . These strategies include minimizing interdialytic weight gain , discontinuing antihypertensive medications prior to dialysis , and not eating during dialysis22 . These methods , however , did not markedly reduce the incidence of interdialytic hypotension9 . Thus , avoiding and/or lowering the frequency of this serious complication is an essential issue for physicians and nurses in dialysis centers . With the advent of the era of big data and artificial intelligence , there are few reports applying the concept of HD big data in HD . We aimed to show the process and method of collecting data , including vital signs , dialysis settings , and demographic data , during HD treatment . We further aimed to clean and analyze the dataset . Due to the massive volume and complexity of the data , the Wistron Corporation Bestshape ? Dialysis Assistant System , comprising two parts , the Vital Info Portal ( VIP ) gateway device and a medical informatics analysis system program , was used . <p> This study is the largest to date to introduce the concept of HD big data in the field of hemodialysis . In the future , this valuable data set may be used to develop an intelligent early-warning system capable of predicting BP changes , setting optimal dialysate parameters , and finally providing timely and individualized suggestions regarding dialysis settings . <h> Methods <p> We recruited outpatient subjects from the HD unit of MacKay Memorial Hospital , a tertiary medical center in Taiwan . The study period was from 2013/06 to 2018/07 . The project and experimental procedures were approved by the institutional review board of our hospital ( 16MMHIS044 ) . The search followed the entire compliance guidelines for good clinical practice and complied with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki . Clinical data were collected after a regular dialysis session . Informed consent was obtained from all study patients . We excluded subjects under 20 years old since adult patients were more appropriate for a chronic disease study . Supplementary information on patient HD risk factors , clinical symptoms , and previous medical history as well as all relevant records and any correlated data were gathered in this study . All data were de-identified to protect patient secrecy in this retrospective study . Data from 1,075 outpatients who underwent a total of 4,366,298 HD recordings in 165,986 HD sessions were collected between 2013/06 and 2018/07 . <p> The default dialysate sodium concentration was 138 ? mmol/L , the dialysate calcium concentration was 3.0 ? mmol/L , the dialysate flow rate was 500 ? ml/min , and the dialysate temperature was 36.5 ? ? C for most patients . Bicarbonate-containing dialysate and biocompatible artificial kidneys were used for all patients . During HD , BP , pulse rate , and body temperature were measured . BP and pulse rate were taken several times by an electronic sphygmomanometer from the session start to the end at 30-minute intervals and additionally thereafter according to clinical need , e.g. , in the case of cramps . Body temperature was checked using an ear thermometer . The vital signs were measured at each time point , and concurrent dialysis settings , including blood flow rate , ultrafiltration rate , total ultrafiltration volume , dialysate temperature , and dialysate sodium concentration , were recorded . If the measured SBP was out of range ( SBP was greater than 200 or less than 30 ) , then the SBP was measured again , and the latest reading was recorded . <p> Figures 1 and 2 outline the data collection process and data collection flow . The subjects underwent HD treatments two to three times a week , with each treatment lasting up to 240 ? minutes . All patients met the inclusion criteria , and all relevant data were obtained . <p> Fig. 1 <p> Schematic flow chart of the big HD data generation . The data were collected from dialysis equipment connected to the Vital Info Portal ( VIP ) gateway and linked with demographic data stored in the hospital information system for each HD session . Finally , the results analyzed from this dataset can be applied to assist the HD staff in treating clinical complications and setting up individualized suggestions regarding dialysis settings in the future . <h> Data Records <p> The data sources were recorded in three tables , HemrecD1 , HemrecVIP , and Idp and are available at figshare23 . Idp , which records the patient demographics , was from HIS . The patient health status for an HD session , including their weight , dry weight , body temperature , etc. , was collected from a dialysis assistant system . Furthermore , HemrecVIP collected data from the HD machine directly via the VIP gateway . The relationships of the three tables are shown in Fig. 3 . The Pid was the unique id used to link the patient information in the Idp and HemrecD1 tables . The Pid and HD data were used to connect the HemrecD1 and HemrecVIP tables . The values were input into a spreadsheet containing various fields : <p> 1 . <p> Idp describes patient demographics , including the following : <p> Pid : Unidentified patient ID . <p> Gender : Patient gender . <p> Birth year : Patient birth year . <p> Firstdialysis : The date the patient underwent HD treatment for the first time . Diabetes : Patient with/without diabetes . <p> The key to linking Idp and HemrecD1 was the "" Pid "" ; the key to merging HemrecD1 and HemrecVIP was the Pid and the date ( key-in date in HemrecD1 and data time in HemrecVIP ) . <p> Conductivity : A parameter for the sodium concentration in the dialysate . <p> Ultrafiltration rate : The rate of ultrafiltration ( ultrafiltration-fluid removal during hemodialysis ) . <p> Bloodflow : The rate of blood flow through dialyzers and associated devices . Dialysis time : Elapsed time of HD : The duration from start to end of each HD session . <h> Technical Validation <p> Due to the massive volume and complexity of the data , we utilized the Wistron Corporation Bestshape ? Dialysis Assistant System , comprising two parts , the VIP gateway device and a medical informatics analysis system program . The VIP gateway is a device that collects vital signs and corresponding dialysis machine settings . Then , the VIP uploads the records to a data lake located in the dialysis center . All data were double-checked on-site by a team of two nurses and were gathered electronically via the VIP gateway . Structured Query Language ( SQL ) was used to manage individual electronic medical records , which were then stored in the Oracle database . <p> Other clinical information , including age , gender , and diabetes mellitus , was also collected in the Hospital Information System ( HIS ) . The data collection process was similar to a conventional SBP clinical study , but the analysis and results were completely different . A conventional study was performed in the time domain , whereas this system was processed in the time-frequency domain . That is , the dataset was not collected in a fixed time interval in different HD sessions and patients . When a patient experienced some symptoms in which the clinic nurse had to change the dialysate setting and then measure the BP , the new machine setting or BP records were recorded in the respective dataset . Hence , we suggest that the use of HEMOBP should consider the time-frequency domain . Although the SBP was processed in the time-frequency domain , the actual condition of the underlying SBP can be detected with high accuracy . This implementation allowed us to build in the R statistical programming environment and conduct visualization using the Shiny web application . We developed an interactive and dynamic web application for a differential HD treatment session . <p> With the ongoing advancements in artificial intelligence and machine-learning techniques , our data can be applied to different HD issues . This application enabled model selection , model prediction , parameter tuning , and the visualization of the results in a user-friendly interface based on this dataset . The construction of an SBP prediction intelligent system through this HD dataset could aid in the clinical decision-making process and further help reduce the incidence of intradialytic hypotension23 . The future application of these models may facilitate SBP-targeted outcome studies and shed light on the reduction in the frequency of intradialytic SBP variability and associated comorbidities . <p> The primary research endpoint was to present the collection of retrospective clinical HD big data . As all cases collected included clinical characteristics , these data can be further applied in many ways , including machine learning and the featured extraction process to find patterns correlated specifically with SBP detection . Statistical analysis was provided for all parties as the means ? ? ? standard deviations for continuous data and number ( percentage ) for categorical data . The correlations between clinical variables were represented by the correlation plot of the SBP dataset . Table 1 shows the data distribution in the three data sets . The averages for the SBP and DBP were 137.68 ? ? ? 25.85 and 68.33 ? ? ? 14.33 ? mmHg , respectively . All demographic distributions are listed in Table 1 . Laboratory biochemistry test results were not included since these tests were performed only once a month , whereas for the BP records , we collected data from each HD session . Figure 4 represents the correlation plot between independent parameters collected in the HEMOdialysis Blood Pressure ( HEMOBP ) dataset . Figure 5 shows the association between SBP and other independent HD parameters , including body temperature , dialysate temperature , ultrafiltration rate , dialysate conductivity , blood flow and dialysis time during HD treatment . <p> Table 1 Characteristics of the patients included in the HEMOBP dataset . <h> Usage Note <p> We provide a longitudinal dataset of HD treatments , including demographic and real-time dialysis settings . As in previous reports on HD big data , the following BP change will be predicted based on the current setting and the patient health information24 . Users should note that the variables could be computed by their study of interest . For example , HD patients have higher pulse pressure ( PP ) values , a surrogate measure of vascular stiffness and an independent predictor of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality at any mean arterial BP ( MAP ) level25,26 . Thus , the big data for PP and MAP in HD patients can be computed via the following formulas from this dataset : SBP-DBP and DBP ? + ? ( SBP-DBP ) /3 , respectively . Figure 6 shows the box plots for PP and MAP versus dialysis time with a 30-minute interval during HD treatment . These valuable data might be further applied to build a model to reduce the high PP level in the HD population . <p> Fig. 6 <p> The association between blood pressure and dialysis time with a 30-minute interval during one HD session .

"<h> The mid-tier strategists targeting ' business as usual ' work <p> One Australian law firm has set operational work in its sights as part of a survival strategy to compete with what its top boss calls a "" tight market "" for all . <p> Speaking to Lawyers Weekly as part of a series about standing firm among the shrinking ranks of Australia 's mid-tier businesses , Hall &amp; Wilcox managing partner Tony Macvean ( pictured ) said that competition today is tough for everybody . <p> Despite the harsh reality of the competitive legal services environment , Hall &amp; Wilcox has been able to grow , and its success is due in no small part to the precision with which it has targeted a particular area of demand for work among its corporate clients . <p> Mr Macvean explained that the firm has been able to do so by directing its strategic focus on operational or ' business as usual ' client needs . <p> "" A few years ago , we recognised that the bigger firms seemed to be more focused on larger transactions and mega disputes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move into the space that had been or was being vacated , "" Mr Macvean said . <p> "" And as a result , we have been appointed to a number of legal panels to kind of handle that ' business as usual ' and operational work . "" <p> His answer to this dilemma is a combination of balance , focus and the ' smarter law ' tagline that Hall &amp; Wilcox has claimed to refer to new technology solutions it is offering its clientele . <p> "" It is competitive at the top end and competitive in the middle as well , with price pressures , the shift of work in-house and reducing volumes of work , "" Mr Macvean said . <p> When it comes to balance in the mid-tier market , fixing an appropriate price point for legal services is also crucial . The challenge for firms is to nail the pricing of quality work , which a client also views as being value for money . <p> Mr Macvean suggested that the approach of those firms desperate for work and inclined to offer legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their business . Conversely , those mid-tiers who get their value proposition right are endorsed when sophisticated clients accept those firms for their panels . <p> "" If you go in too low , it 's just poor quality or lack of investment in the business . At the same time , for operational and ' business as usual ' work , it needs to be provided at a price that demonstrates value to the client . So it 's a balance , "" Mr Macvean said . <p> "" There is also no doubt that there 's price competition and the work needs to be done at a price that is competitive , which is less than what the top-tier firms might have traditionally charged for that type of work , "" he said . <p> For Australia 's leading mid-tier firms national expansion has decisively been led by clients in the insurance and finance sectors . It is a message consistent with the views of Sparke Helmore 's Mark Hickey and Mr Macvean . <p> However , Mr Macvean also considers this expansion as part of a strategic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients to solve problems together . <p> "" We 're not just an insurance firm , but we do that work well . A lot of our national growth has come off the back of our insurance practice and looking to support insurer clients nationally as they consolidate what were state based panels into national panels , "" Mr Macvean said . <p> "" We expanded into new offices and new locations to reflect that and to support those clients . "" <p> Sharing his views on how extra investment in technology-focused solutions need not mean cutting down on fee-earning personnel , the Hall &amp; Willcox head said being innovative can in fact generate more work for mid-tier lawyers . <p> Mr Macvean acknowledged that the firm 's ' Smarter Law ' initiative , in addition to investment in artificial intelligence and document automation technology did have the direct aim of reducing labour costs and giving clients products at a cheaper price . <p> However , digital infrastructure such as portals and collaboration tools also provided platforms for better client engagement , bringing with it more work and justifying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built some logic-based applications , which we 've provided to clients . That has been one way of providing value to clients and , consequently , clients requiring our assistance more as those applications lead to more opportunities to do things , "" Mr Macvean said . <p> As in all business , there is an element of uncertainty about what future challenges tomorrow will bring . For Hall &amp; Willcox , Mr Macvean said he believes that means being poised to adapt to changing conditions and constantly looking for new ways to do things better . <p> "" There 's a lot more to do and I would only consider Hall &amp; Willcox to be among the leading firms when it comes to this stuff , not the best , but just among the leading firms . <p> "" Our willingness to try different things and to work with our clients to solve their problems is one reason that we 've had the success and growth that we have , "" he said . <p> Lawyers Weekly is the leading authoritative source of independent news , analysis and opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert opinion pieces , analysis of the issues impacting on the business of firms , broader geographic coverage of events and issues , regular technology reports as well as regular training &amp; education reports ."

"<p> Emerging technologies associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution ( 4IR ) are fundamentally changing the nature of work and leading to major socio-economic transformations . Many conversations center on questions of how the nature of work is changing , how many and what kind of jobs are created or lost , which new skills will be required , and how workspaces are changing . Another question , particularly relevant for developing and emerging countries , is the impact on informal employment . This article investigates the consequences for India where the informal sector is the country 's "" economic backbone . "" <h> "" Traditional "" informal employment <p> 4IR technologies , such as artificial intelligence , automation , robotics , and the Internet of Things , are likely to find adoption in select niches in the organised sectors of India 's economy , particularly in capital-intense manufacturing industries as well as in financial , legal , IT , and BPO services . 1 However , most Indian employees work in informal jobs , which are defined by ILO 2 as employment relationships that are , in law or in practice , not subject to national labour legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain employment benefits . The size of the informal sector is at about 90% , and has remained at this high level despite India 's IT sector boom and high annual growth rates . 3 The rates of informal employment are particularly high among the youth , in rural areas , and in agriculture . 4IR technologies are unlikely to significantly affect these jobs , because they rely heavily on manual labour and because of the lack of financial capital , supporting infrastructure , and requisite skills . 4 <h> New forms of informality in the gig economy <p> Another major technological development in the last decade has been the rise of digital labour platforms , which connect job seekers and job providers in novel ways . These platforms cater to demands that range from simple tasks that can be performed by lowskilled workers to complex jobs offered to highly educated professionals . Some examples of well-known platforms include Uber and Ola for ride sharing , Upwork for online freelancing , UrbanClap for hiring various local service providers ( e.g. , fitness trainers , carpenters , cleaners , hair stylists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mechanical Turk for various microtasks . <p> With the rise of digital labour platforms , new forms of employment are emerging that deviate from the "" standard employment relationship , "" which is defined as work that is full time , indefinite , and as part of a subordinate relationship between an employee and an employer . 5 A shift towards an increasing number of people taking up "" gig work "" is a key trend characterising the future of work . These non-standard forms employment differ from traditional work arrangements in the following ways : 6 <p> Employment is not open ended : Workers are temporarily employed and receive contracts only for a fixed , usually short term or for the length of a specific project . <p> Employment is not full-time : Workers take up part-time or on-call employment and often combine several such jobs instead of working full-time for one organisation . <p> Employment does not take place within direct , subordinate relationships : Instead , multi-party employment relationships ( e.g. , mediated through labour agencies or brokers ) and subcontracting are becoming more common . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers of people consider themselves as self-employed and freelancers . However , disguised employment and dependent self-employment are frequent phenomena in the gig economy -- the classification of workers as "" self-employed "" is false , if they carry out tasks for one or few clients who they strongly depend on as source(s) of income and who closely supervise their work . <p> These new forms of employment exhibit high degrees of informality . Instead of relying on permanent employees , platforms allow businesses to tap into a flexible workforce and hire workers online to perform jobs on demand and pay them when the task is done . Startups in particular , which themselves play an important role in the digital economy , outsource many tasks to keep their teams lean . By using this new , cheaper method of hiring talent , rather than hiring workers directly , companies therefore incur lower liability , which in turn undermines labour protections. 7 Workers , now classified as "" independent contractors , "" are not entitled to receive the same benefits ( e.g. , health insurance , sick and holiday pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informality is visible in a lack of safety and protection against discrimination and coercion . <p> While no official data is available on the scope and development of the Indian gig economy , atypical work arrangements are clearly on the rise . They generate significant employment opportunities , especially for young people . However , as gig work becomes more mainstream in white-collar professions , such non-standard forms of employment will simply replace regular employment . Consequently , an informalisation of the formal sector can be observed , which implies that informality will be a growing rather than diminishing phenomenon . <h> As gig work becomes more mainstream in white-collar professions , non-standard forms of employment will simply replace regular employment . <p> Implications of informality Informality and its possible impacts on socio-economic development are subject to a controversial and ideologically loaded debate . From a macroeconomic perspective , some argue 8 that the informal sector can be an engine for growth and job creation , as strong linkages exist between formal and informal firms , whereby they benefit from each other . From a microeconomic perspective , new forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decide where and when to work . Moreover , some believe that the gig economy offers plentiful entrepreneurial opportunities and provides a field for experimentation , which allows workers to supplement income and transform a patchwork of jobs into a steady upward career trajectory . 9 <p> On the other hand , informality has negative impacts for individuals , firms , and societies. 10 While some firms reduce costs by outsourcing tasks to informal workers or buying inputs from informal firms , those enterprises are a source of unfair competition for firms which comply with labour laws . Some individuals appreciate the possibility of working more flexibly and will seize opportunities and become successful through "" side hustles . "" However , most workers still prefer characteristics associated with traditional employee-employer relationships , whereas job security is still valued more than flexibility and other work attributes . 11 In addition , the beneficiaries will likely be some educated few , while the majority of workers turn to the gig economy because they have no other option . For them , the increasing informality of non-standard forms of employment will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower tax revenue for the government , which and weakens its financial ability to invest into and accelerate the country 's development . <h> Addressing the challenges of new labour market realities <p> Ultimately , the existing reach of informal employment in India and the emergence of non-standard forms of employment that defines the gig economy will make informality a growing phenomenon . A continued effort should be made by policymakers to incentivise formalisation by lowering the costs and bureaucratic obstacles for declaring workers and promoting legal compliance . At the same time , however , given the political imperative to create jobs and the gig economy 's employment generation potential , informality needs to be embraced as an economic reality . The challenge is twofold : on the one hand , to give companies the necessary flexibility to innovate and compete successfully in a business environment characterised by rapid technological change , and on the other hand , to ensure that workers in new forms of employment can build sustainable livelihoods . <h> A continued effort should be made by policymakers to incentivise formalisation by lowering the costs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Government as well as corporate and worker representatives must work together to actively shape the future of work and address challenges associated with informality . First , there is a lack of reliable knowledge on Indians working in the gig economy . The government , in cooperation with universities and research organisations , should collect quantitative data and enable qualitative research to track how many people are engaged in non-standard forms of employment , and to better understand their working conditions . Second , the issue of frequent misclassification of employment has to be addressed . Those who work in dependent work in subordinate relationships fulfill the definition of an employee and have to be classified as such , and therefore need to be treated by the same standards . <p> Third , taking into consideration the characteristics of non-standard forms of employment , Indian labour and social protection laws and schemes need to be adjusted . One opportunity is provided through the fact that informal workers are no longer invisible : once they are registered on a platform , they can be connected to social security frameworks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need new forms of organisation and representation to strengthen their collective bargaining efforts in the platform economy . Finally and critically , investments in education and skilling are required to better equip the Indian labour force for new labour market realities . <h> People <p> Dr. Sabrina Korreck is a Senior Fellow at Observer Research Foundation .

The size of the informal sector is at about 90% , and has remained at this high level despite India 's IT sector boom and high annual growth rates . 3 The rates of informal employment are particularly high among the youth , in rural areas , and in agriculture . 4IR technologies are unlikely to significantly affect these jobs , because they rely heavily on manual labour and because of the lack of financial capital , supporting infrastructure , and requisite skills . 4 <h> New forms of informality in the gig economy <p> Another major technological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digital labour platforms , which connect job seekers and job providers in novel ways . These platforms cater to demands that range from simple tasks that can be performed by lowskilled workers to complex jobs offered to highly educated professionals . Some examples of well-known platforms include Uber and Ola for ride sharing , Upwork for online freelancing , UrbanClap for hiring various local service providers ( e.g. , fitness trainers , carpenters , cleaners , hair stylists ) , Flexing It for consulting assignments , and Amazon Mechanical Turk for various microtasks . <p> With the rise of digital labour platforms , new forms of employment are emerging that deviate from the "" standard employment relationship , "" which is defined as work that is full time , indefinite , and as part of a subordinate relationship between an employee and an employer . 5 A shift towards an increasing number of people taking up "" gig work "" is a key trend characterising the future of work . These non-standard forms employment differ from traditional work arrangements in the following ways : 6 <p> Employment is not open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a fixed , usually short term or for the length of a specific project . <p> Employment is not full-time : Workers take up part-time or on-call employment and often combine several such jobs instead of working full-time for one organisation . <p> Employment does not take place within direct , subordinate relationships : Instead , multi-party employment relationships ( e.g. , mediated through labour agencies or brokers ) and subcontracting are becoming more common . <p> Employment is not part of traditional employer-employee relationships : Increasing numbers of people consider themselves as self-employed and freelancers . However , disguised employment and dependent self-employment are frequent phenomena in the gig economy -- the classification of workers as "" self-employed "" is false , if they carry out tasks for one or few clients who they strongly depend on as source(s) of income and who closely supervise their work . <p> These new forms of employment exhibit high degrees of informality . Instead of relying on permanent employees , platforms allow businesses to tap into a flexible workforce and hire workers online to perform jobs on demand and pay them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which themselves play an important role in the digital economy , outsource many tasks to keep their teams lean . By using this new , cheaper method of hiring talent , rather than hiring workers directly , companies therefore incur lower liability , which in turn undermines labour protections. 7 Workers , now classified as "" independent contractors , "" are not entitled to receive the same benefits ( e.g. , health insurance , sick and holiday pay , family leaves ) as regular employees . Moreover , informality is visible in a lack of safety and protection against discrimination and coercion . <p> While no official data is available on the scope and development of the Indian gig economy , atypical work arrangements are clearly on the rise . They generate significant employment opportunities , especially for young people . However , as gig work becomes more mainstream in white-collar professions , such non-standard forms of employment will simply replace regular employment . Consequently , an informalisation of the formal sector can be observed , which implies that informality will be a growing rather than diminishing phenomenon . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development are subject to a controversial and ideologically loaded debate . From a macroeconomic perspective , some argue 8 that the informal sector can be an engine for growth and job creation , as strong linkages exist between formal and informal firms , whereby they benefit from each other . From a microeconomic perspective , new forms of employment afford more flexibility and give the worker freedom to decide where and when to work . Moreover , some believe that the gig economy offers plentiful entrepreneurial opportunities and provides a field for experimentation , which allows workers to supplement income and transform a patchwork of jobs into a steady upward career trajectory . 9 <p> On the other hand , informality has negative impacts for individuals , firms , and societies. 10 While some firms reduce costs by outsourcing tasks to informal workers or buying inputs from informal firms , those enterprises are a source of unfair competition for firms which comply with labour laws . Some individuals appreciate the possibility of working more flexibly and will seize opportunities and become successful through "" side hustles . "" However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereas job security is still valued more than flexibility and other work attributes . 11 In addition , the beneficiaries will likely be some educated few , while the majority of workers turn to the gig economy because they have no other option . For them , the increasing informality of non-standard forms of employment will imply higher vulnerability and uncertainty . Finally , informality implies lower tax revenue for the government , which and weakens its financial ability to invest into and accelerate the country 's development . <h> Addressing the challenges of new labour market realities <p> Ultimately , the existing reach of informal employment in India and the emergence of non-standard forms of employment that defines the gig economy will make informality a growing phenomenon . A continued effort should be made by policymakers to incentivise formalisation by lowering the costs and bureaucratic obstacles for declaring workers and promoting legal compliance . At the same time , however , given the political imperative to create jobs and the gig economy 's employment generation potential , informality needs to be embraced as an economic reality . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give companies the necessary flexibility to innovate and compete successfully in a business environment characterised by rapid technological change , and on the other hand , to ensure that workers in new forms of employment can build sustainable livelihoods. <h> pullquoteA continued effort should be made by policymakers to incentivise formalisation by lowering the costs and bureaucratic obstacles for declaring workers and promoting legal compliance. /pullquote <p> Government as well as corporate and worker representatives must work together to actively shape the future of work and address challenges associated with informality . First , there is a lack of reliable knowledge on Indians working in the gig economy . The government , in cooperation with universities and research organisations , should collect quantitative data and enable qualitative research to track how many people are engaged in non-standard forms of employment , and to better understand their working conditions . Second , the issue of frequent misclassification of employment has to be addressed . Those who work in dependent work in subordinate relationships fulfill the definition of an employee and have to be classified as such , and therefore need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking into consideration the characteristics of non-standard forms of employment , Indian labour and social protection laws and schemes need to be adjusted . One opportunity is provided through the fact that informal workers are no longer invisible : once they are registered on a platform , they can be connected to social security frameworks . 12 Fourth , as self-employed workers are disconnected , they need new forms of organisation and representation to strengthen their collective bargaining efforts in the platform economy . Finally and critically , investments in education and skilling are required to better equip the Indian labour force for new labour market realities ."
"<p> Caryl Johnson of Portland , a brilliant polymath and pioneer in the field of seismology , died Friday at age 73 . <p> Caryl Johnson Photo courtesy Kay Aikin <p> Johnson 's groundbreaking early work in seismology formed the basis for modern earthquake detection systems and even inspired a passage in author Tom Clancy 's 1984 spy thriller "" The Hunt for Red October , "" said Kay Aikin , Johnson 's life and business partner . <p> Thanks to Johnson 's uncanny ability to find connections among wide-ranging fields of knowledge , she went on to make advancements in areas as diverse as geothermal energy , electrical grid controls and cervical cancer research . <p> "" She was the smartest person I ever met , "" Aikin said . "" Caryl was on a whole different intellectual level . "" <p> Johnson died at Maine Medical Center from complications related to cancer . <p> Born in Marshalltown , Iowa , Johnson earned a bachelor 's degree in physics and a master 's degree in geophysics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and a doctoral degree in geophysics from the California Institute of Technology . She had a long and varied career as a scientist , educator and entrepreneur , living in Southern California and Hawaii before coming to Maine . <p> Johnson is most widely known for her work in earthquake detection , where she developed one of the first computerized seismic processing systems for locating earthquakes in real time , Aikin said . Forms of Johnson 's seismic processing software are now regarded as the global standard and are used throughout the world for monitoring earthquakes and providing quick disaster response . <p> Her work was adapted for use by the U.S. Navy in the 1980s to form a key part of its upgraded sonar combat system . In "" The Hunt for Red October , "" there is a scene in which one character explains to another how the Navy 's sonar combat system was based on research in seismology . <p> "" Caryl was the inspiration for that conversation , "" Aikin said . <p> Johnson spent most of the 1980s as a geophysicist for the U.S. Geological Survey 's Southern California Seismic Network . She went on to teach geology and geophysics at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu in the 1990s , while also researching the process of magma flow inside Kilauea , an active volcano , and raising her three children . <p> Johnson went on to work for the defense industry , where she developed a new way to use spectral imaging for anti-submarine warfare that was later repurposed to help doctors diagnose cervical cancer , Aikin said . At aerospace company BAE Systems , Johnson worked on intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance systems for the Navy that combined her broad scientific knowledge in big data , navigation , imaging and artificial intelligence technology . <p> Johnson moved to Portland in 2012 , where she and Aikin co-founded a business , Introspective Systems . Among her many projects , Johnson developed a decentralized computer-control system for managing the complex wind and solar energy-reliant power microgrid on Isle au Haut . <p> Her solution involves tiny , inexpensive computers known as Raspberry Pi devices that are placed at each power customer 's location . The devices collect information on power usage , supply and pricing while constantly communicating with each other , learning patterns and adapting automatically to make real-time decisions that help maintain a reliable and cost-effective power supply . <p> Isle au Haut Electric Power Co . President Jim Wilson said Johnson 's "" visionary "" solution to the island 's problems of power cost and reliability are a perfect example of how Johnson could take principles from one scientific discipline -- in this case economics -- and apply it to another discipline such as power grid management . <p> "" She developed a solution that is innovative and takes a whole different perspective on the problem , "" Wilson said . "" It 's a really , really clever idea . "" <p> Longtime Maine entrepreneur and investor Don Gooding was one of the early angel investors in Introspective Systems . Gooding said that as a former technology venture capitalist , he has developed the ability to recognize an "" off-the-charts brilliant "" technical mind when he meets one . <p> "" She was one of those , "" he said of Johnson . "" She had an ability to see a very big picture , and to connect the dots between a variety of different things to help solve major problems . "" <p> When Johnson was n't absorbed in research or computer programming , she was a voracious consumer of educational material and an avid computer gamer . Aikin said Johnson once boasted that she had logged over 20,000 hours in her lifetime on the multiplayer online role-playing game EverQuest . <p> Johnson also had the type of high-level sarcastic wit that often would require the recipients of her humor to think for a few moments before they figured out the joke , Aikin said . <p> Johnson 's mind was always working , always striving to solve the next problem . That work did n't stop until the moment of her death . <p> "" The day before she went in the hospital , we were designing algorithms on her board in her office , "" Aikin said . <p> A memorial service will be held at 4 p.m . Dec. 14 at Introspective Systems , 148 Middle St. , Suite 1D , in Portland . Those planning to attend should RSVP via email at email protected .

"<p> There are at two main positions on the subject : the view that automation , driven by novel artificial intelligence technologies and more capable robots , will replace human labour in a wide array of jobs and business creating mass unemployment , and the competing theory , pointing to history , that technology has created more jobs than it has destroyed . Blacksmiths lost jobs as car tires replaced horseshoes , but carmakers hired more than enough people to make up for those losses , and paid them better , to boot . ( There 's a third camp , that thinks the whole issue of automation is overblown , and that if anything we 're seeing productivity slow down . That 's a totally different problem , but not as many people are writing in alarmist tones about it . ) <p> But even if the optimists are right , there 's another possibility that should concern us : automation may leave most people better off , while leaving most places worse off . <p> A recent report from the Brookfield Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship examines cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up their local economies , and how susceptible those industries are to automation . The results are grimly predictable : Places that rely on agriculture , mining , and manufacturing are most vulnerable to automation-driven job losses , while places that rely on government administration jobs , health , education , or finance are at much less risk . Brookfield 's analysis does n't say what level of job loss any particular city can expect from automation , but it 's a useful map of how vulnerable some places are . <p> The report does n't predict how many jobs will actually be lost to automation , just pointing out who and what is most vulnerable to it . To use a different looming threat as a metaphor , it 's not a prediction of how much sea levels might rise in a warming world , but a depiction of who 's living well above the high-water mark and who 's right at the shoreline . <p> As far as Ontario goes , the analysis suggests that the places that are already doing well are the least likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ottawa Valley will keep doing just fine , as will smaller cities that have government as major employers ( university and military towns , for the most part ) . But the manufacturing and resource-based southwest and north of the province , which already have had a rough time over the last decade or so , are arguably in for more pain . <p> The data in the Brookfield report at least implicitly implies one solution : if smaller cities with large government employers are going to be most resilient in an automated future , maybe the answer for more vulnerable communities is more government employment . <p> While the Liberals want to test-run a universal basic income in Thunder Bay , Hamilton , and Lindsay , there 's a competing policy some progressives are proposing to deal with inequality and ( perhaps ) the threat of AI-induced labour unrest : a universal job guarantee . ( In essence , a universal income that comes with a job attached . ) There 's a substantial debate between the guaranteed-income and guaranteed-jobs camps , over everything from fairness ( can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost ( if the government can just mail cheques to people , why complicate things ? ) and more . <p> But if there 's a desire to literally spread the prosperity around the province , and mitigate inequities by maintaining economic activity across regions , a jobs guarantee tied to bringing work to communities around Ontario may offer government more leverage than a simple universal income . The simplicity of cutting people a cheque is appealing on a number of grounds , but recent events , whether the vote on Brexit in the U.K. or the election of Donald Trump in the U.S. , make an argument for keeping a place-based lens on policy . There 's no shortage of work that could be done in the province . If nothing else , the government could build more and better hospitals and universities in the parts of the province where a diploma or a doctor 's appointment currently means taking a long trip to Toronto or Ottawa . <p> Of course , either solution assumes that political parties and voters will be willing to pay the substantial costs involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big province with a small government . <p> Photo courtesy of Spencer Cooper and licensed for commercial use under a Creative Commons licence .

"<h> Zuckerberg tells Harvard we need a new social contract of equal opportunity <h> 0 <p> Mark Zuckerberg 's Harvard commencement speech centered around how we can improve life through big projects , equal opportunity and building both local and global community . He outlined a plan "" to create a world where every single person has a sense of purpose . "" <p> Rather than focusing on the opportunities for the Harvard students graduating in front of him , he urged the students to ignite opportunities for those less fortunate . And instead of shying away from the fact that technology is creating new challenges for the underprivileged , he said we need to address head on automation 's impact on employment . <p> You can watch the replay of his speech here : <p> Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard his sophomore year in 2004 to scale up Facebook as it rapidly grew . But today he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree , apparently to the delight of his parents , and became the youngest commencement speaker in Harvard 's history . <p> Today 's speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the philosophy of building community that he outlined in his 6,000 word "" humanitarian manifesto "" letter he published earlier this year . He describes this purpose as Facebook 's new mission after spending more than a decade trying to make the world more "" open and connected . "" <p> To grow his understanding of how to build global community , Zuckerberg 's annual personal challenge for 2017 was to visit and meet new people in every U.S. state he had n't already visited . Many have described the similarity of his tour to how politicians "" shake hands and kiss babies "" as they campaign for election , stoking speculation that Zuckerberg might run for president of the United States . Zuckerberg has repeatedly denied this is his plan . <p> Yet with 1.8 billion users , Facebook 's citizenship dwarfs that of the U.S. , and Zuckerberg 's choices directly impact the way people socialize , organize and do business every day . Perhaps getting to know a wider swath of those users in person so he can serve them through Facebook 's product is plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed on his trip shone through in the narrative of inclusiveness wound through his speech . <h> Purpose <p> Zuckerberg began with a couple of corny jokes about how the students at "" the greatest university in the world "" had "" accomplished something I never could . "" And while he might have built Facebook in his dorm room , it was its predecessor "" FaceMash "" that had the biggest impact on him . That 's because the app almost got him kicked out of Harvard , and at the premature going away party his friends threw him , he met his future wife , Priscilla Chan . <p> Then the Facebook CEO launched into the meat of his talk about the idea of purpose -- not just finding purpose for one 's self , but giving others the chance to have a true purpose . He broke down his strategy to achieve this goal into three parts . <h> Big projects <p> Putting a man on the moon seemed like an impossibly large challenge at first , but through the contributions of a legion of not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we accomplished that feat . It not only paid technological dividends , but created jobs , too . <p> Zuckerberg explained : <p> "" Our generation will have to deal with tens of millions of jobs replaced by automation like self-driving cars and trucks . But we have the potential to do so much more together . Every generation has its defining works . More than 300,000 people worked to put a man on the moon . Millions of volunteers immunized children around the world against polio . Millions of more people built the Hoover Dam and other great projects . These projects did n't just provide purpose for the people doing those jobs , they gave our whole country a sense of pride that we could do great things . Now it 's our turn to do great things . "" <p> The biggest challenge with big projects is getting started , he says , but we must persevere . Climate change might seem like too large a goal to know where to begin , but Zuckerberg suggests we put people to work installing solar panels . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he believes individuals can help by contributing their health and genome data . He even suggests us working to modernize democracy so we can vote online . <h> Equal opportunity <p> To maximize progress , everyone must have a role , not just the rich or those in the First World . And as artificial intelligence and robots improve , more and more jobs will be at risk . <p> Zuckerberg in his old college dorm room <p> Zuckerberg says , "" Now it 's time for our generation to define a new social contract , "" where we measure progress not by growing GDP but by ubiquitous participation with the economy . <p> "" We can all make time to give someone a hand . Let 's give everyone the freedom to pursue their purpose -- not only because it 's the right thing to do , but because when more people can turn their dreams into something great , we 're all better for it . "" <p> Lending a hand can take many different forms . Zuckerberg says that universal basic income could unlock people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to society rather than merely trying to survive . Other suggestions he gave included affordable childcare so parents can continue working , flexible preventative healthcare so people stay healthy rather than generating more costs , prison reform to give low-level offenders a second chance and continuous education to make sure people stay employable as they age . <h> Building community <p> Finally , Zuckerberg believes that we need to foster a sense of community , both locally with our neighbors so we can build support networks for individuals , and between nations to unite the globe around giant collective problems like climate change . <p> "" We get that our greatest opportunities are now global -- we can be the generation that ends poverty , that ends disease . We get that our greatest challenges need global responses too -- no country can fight climate change alone or prevent pandemics . Progress now requires coming together not just as cities or nations , but also as a global community . "" <p> A survey found that millennials around the globe predominantly identify their generation as "" citizens of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made at the U.N . Instead , Zuckerberg sees each generation expanding the circle of who we consider "" one of us "" by becoming secure enough to care about others . <p> Zuckerberg drew the battle lines , which squarely painted President Donald Trump on the other side of progress without naming him : <p> "" We live in an unstable time.There are people left behind by globalization across the whole world . And it 's hard to care about people in other places , when we do n't first feel good about our lives here at home . There 's pressure to turn inwards . This is the struggle of our time . The forces of freedom , openness and global community , against the forces of authoritarianism , isolationism , and nationalism . Forces for the flow of knowledge , trade and immigration , against those that would slow them down . "" <p> Zuckerberg gets teary-eyed while concluding his speech <p> The gravity of this fight seemed to wash over Zuckerberg near the end of the talk . The infamously stoic Zuckerberg began to tear up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't go to college because he 's an undocumented immigrant . <p> Perhaps the most important thing that came out of the speech was Zuckerberg 's maturing perspective of how all this progress will be made . While his manifesto repeatedly offered deeper connection through Facebook as the answer , Zuckerberg never mentioned specific parts of the app he built in today 's speech . Maybe he 's realized that a product 's impact is defined by the virtues of those who use it . There 's plenty to fix within Facebook . But each of us must decide how wide we care to spread our circle of inclusion and opportunity ."

"<h> Terms Beginning With ' n ' <h> Neural network <p> October 20 , 2020 <p> Team Kalkine <h> What is a neural network ? <p> A neural network is a unit of deep learning , which itself is sub-field of machine learning . Neural network refers to a series of algorithms that mimic the way a human brain operates to understand relationships between massive amounts of datasets . <p> A neural network takes input data and then trains itself to recognize patterns of the data . Based on the pattern recognition , the network then predicts the output for a new set of similar data . <h> History of Neural Networks : <p> The study of the human brain is quite old . However , the first step towards the neural network started in 1943 . Warren McCulloch , a neurophysiologist and a mathematician , in the year 1943 , wrote a paper related to how neurons might work . During that time , a simple neural network model was created using electrical circuits . <h> What are the major types of neural networks ? <p> There are four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connected Layer : <p> Fully connected layer connects each neuron in one layer to each neuron in the next layer . These types are found in several neural networks that range from standard neural network to convolutional neural networks ( CNN ) . <p> The fully connected layer forms a vital component of CNNs which can be proved beneficial in recognizing and classifying images for computer vision . <p> Convolution Layer : <p> A Convolution Layer is an essential type of layer in a CNN and is used for detecting features in images . In this process , the convolution layer uses a filter through which it scans an image , a few pixels at a time . It then creates a feature map that predicts the class of each feature . <p> Convolution Layer is used for analyzing imagery for recognizing an image and classification . <p> Deconvolution Layer : <p> A Deconvolution Layer is a transposed convolution method that unsamples data to high resolution in an effective way . It comprises of image data or feature maps that are formed from a convolution layer or other types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looping capacity . Its input comprises data for analysis plus output from the earlier calculation done by that layer . Recurrent layers are the base of recurrent neural network ( RNN ) that provide them with memory while being recursive in nature , RNN is beneficial for cases related to sequential data such as natural language and time series . <h> What are the attributes of neural networks ? <p> Just like humans can solve any particular problem , neural networks also have human-like ability to solve a problem . Below are some of the features of neural networks . <p> Adaptive Learning <p> Self-Organization <p> Real-time operation <p> Prediction <p> Fault Tolerance <h> Major areas where we see the application of neural networks <p> Below are some of the areas where we can see the application of neural network . <p> Speech Recognition : <p> Speech is a way through which one communicates to others . Hence , for communication with machines , there is a need for a language that the computer or a machine can understand . These languages are quite sophisticated and are difficult to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been made on this front , however , still there some issues with these systems as they are facing problems of limited vocabulary or grammar plus the challenges concerning retaining the system for different speakers in different conditions . <p> Artificial neural network ( ANN ) has played an essential role in speech recognition . Multilayer networks , multilayer networks with recurrent connections and Kohonen self-organizing feature map are some ANNs used for this purpose . <p> Character Recognition : <p> ANN is also used in the fields of Pattern Recognition . Some of the ANNs that is used for character recognition includes multilayer neural networks such as Backpropagation neural networks and neo-cognition . <p> Many neural networks are being developed to automatically find out handwritten character , which could be either letter or digits . <p> Signature Verification Application : <p> Signature of an individual plays a vital role in checking the authenticity of the user for any critical transaction or deal . <p> For this , the first method is to extract the feature of the signature . In the next step , the neural networks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an efficient algorithm . Once this gets accomplished , then the system is ready to classify the signature that is original to the one which is forged . <p> Human Face Recognition : <p> This can be considered as a biometric method that can identify a particular face . In the first place , the image is pre-processed and then the dimension is being reduced . In the last stage , it must be classified based on the neural network training algorithm ."
"<h> Create your own Bach harmony via Google 's first AI-driven Doodle <p> To celebrate the birthday of composer Johann Sebastian Bach today , Google has created the first AI-powered Google Doodle that allows anyone to create their own Bach harmony directly within the Doodle on Google 's search page . <p> The Doodle is an interactive experience encouraging players to compose a two-measure melody of their choice -- users can add notes , accidentals , change tempo and key . Then , with the press of a button , the Doodle uses machine learning to harmonize the custom melody into Bach 's signature music style ( or a Bach 80 's rock style hybrid if you happen to find a very special Easter egg in the Doodle ... ) <p> The machine learning engine behind today 's Doodle was trained by analysing 306 of Bach 's chorale harmonisations . His chorales always have four voices , each carrying their own melodic line while creating a rich harmonic progression when played together , and it was this concise structure that made the chorales good training data for a machine learning model ."
"<h> - All the Amazon Alexa devices compared <p> Amazon has a blistering array of Echo speakers , suiting a full range of prices and uses . From the compact up to those you might want to pair for a fuller music experience , through to a selection of devices with displays . <p> There 's also a burgeoning ecosystem of other Amazon smart devices that work in some way with Alexa - such as the Amazon Echo Wall Clock . We 're detailing what they all do , what the differences are and highlighting the best prices , because Amazon loves to discount when Black Friday comes . <p> The second generation of the original Echo appeared in 2017 offering a more compact device with a fabric covering . It offers all the Alexa power , serving as the centre of the universe while coming in at a hugely affordable price . <p> It 's designed to fit into your home thanks to those changeable shells and it 's very much aligning itself as a competitor to Google Home . While it offers all the skills of Alexa and Bluetooth - and the rest of the Echo experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model , nor as good as the Echo Plus . This is the model to get if you want to get connected cheaply , but accepting that music is n't top of your list . <p> The 2019 Echo takes the quality of the 2018 Echo Plus with the same speaker configuration and design , introducing a new colour , but otherwise offering a higher-quality design and sound than the second-gen Echo . <p> It does n't have the Zigbee controller that you 'll find on the Echo Plus , but that 's a minor omission . If you 're after a quality smart speaker then this new Amazon Echo is likely to be the best choice . It 's brand new and not available until 16 October , but having enjoyed the Echo Plus , we 're certain this will be a great speaker for the price . <p> This second-generation version of the Echo Plus appeared in 2018 and takes a shorter , wider stance , with a cloth-covered exterior . The design is essentially exactly the same as the third-gen Echo - as are the speakers inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions that all other Echo devices will offer you , but has a built-in Zigbee controller ( like largest Echo Show ) , meaning you can directly connect to and control compatible smart home devices . <p> It can also be stereo paired with another Echo Plus and partnered with the Echo Sub to create a 2.1 system . It 's a great all-rounder , but giving that the performance is now matched by the new Echo , you have to really need that Zigbee controller to justify the extra price . <p> The Echo Studio is top dog for audio in the Echo range , expanding into a bigger unit designed to give much richer sound . It supports the new Amazon Music HD service , as well as offering support for Dolby Atmos and 3D formats from MPEG-H , like Sony 360 Reality Audio . Not only is this a music master , it can handle your TV audio too , compatible with wireless connections to Fire TV devices . It can also be stereo paired . <p> But at its heart , this is still an Alexa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as offering a Zigbee controller so it can natively connect to smart home devices and control them . It 's not going to be available until 7 November , but first impressions are very good - especially as it 's great value for money . <p> The Echo Dot has been amazingly popular and the third generation was redesigned in 2018 , ditching the hard plastic to match the new Echo Plus . It 's a larger diameter than the original model it replaces and that gives space for a new 1.6-inch speaker . <p> That means the Echo Dot is now a much better standalone Alexa device , better equipped to converse with you and while it 's not really designed as a music device , it will give you better overall sound . It can also be connected to another speaker via 3.5mm cable if you wish , although if you do n't need the speaker bit check out the Echo Input below . <p> The Amazon Echo Input is designed to add Alexa to existing speakers ( such as a separates hi-fi system ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable . It 's like the Echo Dot , but without the speaker . <p> As such this is the cheapest Echo , but the drawback is that it wo n't voice feedback when you 're not connected to other speakers . <p> Amazon Echo Flex is the smallest way to get Alexa in your home , plugging right into the wall . It has a speaker and microphone to deliver the Alexa experience , but there 's also a 3.5mm socket in case you did want to hook it up to existing speakers . <p> It also has a USB connection on it which can be used to charge a phone , but can also accept accessories , including a motion sensor ( for Ring Guard ) or a night light . It 's a versatile little device and an easy addition to any room . Naturally , it 's not really designed for playing music due to the small speaker , but if you want voice control or Alexa features without the wires , then the Flex is an interesting choice . <h> Amazon Echo Sub <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it does n't offer Alexa in its own right ; instead , the Echo Sub acts to boost your Echo set-up by adding a dedicated subwoofer . <p> The Echo Sub can be paired with one Echo or Echo Plus , but it 's ideally suited to a stereo-paired set of Echos , to create a 2.1 system . The only drawback here is that you 'll have to use Echos of the same type , so a pair of Echo Plus , for example . <p> Essentially , if you 're an Echo fan and already have one or two Echos , then the Echo Sub is a great upgrade , meaning you 'll have a decent music system - and all with Alexa 's great voice control . <p> The Echo Show 5 gets its name from the 5.5-inch display and is essentially just a smaller version of the main Echo Show . However , it 's also significantly cheaper and way better value than the main Echo Show . There are some compromises in camera and sound quality , although it provides sound good enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front camera for Alexa Calling , has a single speaker for all your audio and looks like a nicer option for a bedside Echo . Like the Echo Spot , it can also be used as a gradually-brightening alarm clock , while there 's a new privacy shutter over the camera , too . <p> Like the other Show , there 's no YouTube support which remains a disappointment . But there is video calling with Skype as well as Ring doorbell integration . <p> The Echo Show 8 slots into the gap between the Echo Show ( 10-inch ) and the Echo Show 5 . It lacks the Zigbee controller that you 'll get in the larger model , but offers a little boost over the smaller model . <p> There 's a camera on the front - including a cover - so when you 're not using it for calling you can protect your privacy . This is really a larger Show 5 , slightly lower power than the 10-inch model . <p> The second-generation Show expands the display over the original model and moves the speakers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visual experience in an improved design , and that 's what you get . <p> You get all the Alexa skills you did previously , including video calling ( now boosted with Skype support ) , as well as the inclusion of a Zigbee controller . Like the Echo Plus , the new Show can set up and control compatible smart home devices without the need for separate hubs or apps . <p> The Echo Show remains king of the kitchen , capable of both entertaining and informing , with the display letting you see cooking recipes and your timers , as well as a whole lot more . <p> The Amazon Echo Spot is what you 'd get if you cross the Echo Show with the Echo Dot . It 's a compact Echo to sit beside your bed for alarms . It has a small 2.5-inch screen , which can be used for basic tasks and skills , like music , but it does a lot more . Like the Echo Show it can be used to make video calls , with a front camera . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in a much smaller form factor - but there 's no Zigbee controller . It can also connect to your Bluetooth speakers , or via line-out . <h> Alexa Gadgets <p> Amazon officially announced Alexa Gadgets as a range of innovative devices that take Alexa into a new realm . We 've included the Echo Look in this selection , because of its unique set of features . <p> Pocket-lint <h> Amazon Echo Wall Clock <p> squirrelwidget158224 <p> Dimensions : 254 x 254 x 41mm , 380g <p> Connectivity : Connects to your compatible Echo device <p> Display : Er , it 's a clock <p> Audio : None <p> Alexa : No , it uses the other device <p> It 's a clock that you initially think makes no sense - it 's a pretty dumb smart gadget as it is , to all intents and purposes , a relatively cheap wall clock with some LEDs around the edge . But you know what ? We 've come to depend on ours . It shows you timers in a visual way , so if you regularly cook with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful to see at-a-glance when stuff is finishing . <p> Echo Look is a $199 Wi-Fi camera that offers full Alexa functionality plus hands-free photo and video . It is pitched as a cloud-connected fashion consultant that allows you to snap pictures of yourself in various outfits . Alexa 's software will automatically blur the background in each image to make your outfit pop , and then it uses machine learning guided by "" fashion experts "" to serve up recommendations about what you should wear . <p> It will work as any other Alexa-enabled device , allowing you to access music , traffic timers , weather , and a vast library of "" skills . "" The device is wall-mountable , too , and includes a 5-megapixel sensor , built-in microphone array , and small built-in speaker . It also has LED lights ( used for the flash ) . <p> The Echo Connect is a box that you plug your landline phone connection into to turn it into a voice-controlled system . The box works with an Echo to give you Alexa control over your conventional phone line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the home simply by telling it to answer or ring a contact . <p> As it uses your existing landline number , you wo n't need to sign up for any additional services either . Plus , it all connects to other Echo devices around the home so you can call from an Echo speaker in the kitchen , say , or a Dot in the bedroom . It effectively signals the end of the basic handset . <h> Amazon Echo Buttons <p> squirrelwidget148876 <p> Dimensions : 75 x 75 x 36mm , 52g <p> Connectivity : Bluetooth <p> Included cables : N/A , requires two AAA batteries ( included ) <p> Audio : N/A <p> Alexa : N/A <p> Echo Buttons are Bluetooth-connected devices with an illuminated button that can connect to Alexa for gaming . Imagine playing a game , such as Jeopardy , and being able to slap these buzzer buttons as you play . Jeopardy , of course , has long been a popular skill on Amazon 's Alexa platform , so it makes sense that the company would want to develop an accessory that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these buttons for any Alexa-enabled game skill , including trivia ones . <h> Conclusion : Which Echo should you buy ? <p> When it comes to the Echo speakers , the new third-gen Echo ( or Echo 3 as some might call it ) looks like it 's going to be the hot speaker to opt for - great sound and great value for money - when it goes on sale in October . <p> If music is what 's important to you , then adding the Echo Sub will boost the experience , adding low range skills - so this is also great as an upgrade option in the future . Stereo pairing then makes for a great 2.1 system . <p> The Echo Plus is a natural smart home controller - although all Echo devices have Alexa skills to support a wide range of smart home devices , the Echo Plus will discover , name and control those devices that use Zigbee ( like Philips Hue ) without the need for separate hubs or apps . If you 're building a smart home , the Echo Plus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a whole other league , by far the most ambitious speaker from an audio point of view really boosting the quality - but also offering Dolby Atmos and immersive audio when partnered with your Fire TV . It can also be stereo paired , which will be formidable setup . <p> Echo Dot is ideal to extend Alexa to other rooms of the house where you do n't have an Echo , so if you 've set up a voice-controlled smart home , Echo Dot makes it easy to always be in voice range - although the Echo Flex will subtly plug into the wall and offer voice controls - although it 's not going to be great for music . <p> The Echo Show takes things in a different direction . It 's more expensive , but it gives you video calling and a display for more interactive returns . If you know someone else with an Echo Show , it 's a natural choice to save you from needing to use Skype on your laptop . Echo Show also offers a Zigbee controller , so has all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Show 5 and Show 8 offer smaller display options , both offering plenty of interactive fun , but not quite as capable as the 10-inch model . We 'd pick the Show 5 over the Echo Spot for its better sound and more conventional"

First , we will implement these two models in CIFAR-10 classification and then we will evaluate and compare both of their performances and with other transfer learning models in the same task . <h> MobileNet <p> The MobileNet was proposed as a deep learning model by Andrew G. Howard et al of Google Research team in their research work entitled "" MobileNets : Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a family of mobile-first computer vision models for TensorFlow , designed to effectively maximize accuracy while being mindful of the restricted resources for an on-device or embedded application . MobileNets are small , low-latency , low-power models parameterized to meet the resource constraints of a variety of use cases . They can be built upon for classification , detection , embedding and segmentation similar to how other popular large scale models . <p> ( Image Source : Original Research Paper ) <h> ResNet-50 <p> ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep . You can load a pre-trained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database . The pre-trained network can classify images into 1000 object categories , such as a keyboard , mouse , pencil , and many animals . As a result , the network has learned rich feature representations for a wide range of images . The architecture of a ResNet-50 model can be given in the below figure . <h> Implementation <p> Before implementing the above models , we will download and preprocess the CIFAR-10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have done in the previous articles . <p> As we can see in the confusion matrices and average accuracies , ResNet-50 has given better accuracy than MobileNet . The ResNet-50 has accuracy 81% in 30 epochs and the MobileNet has accuracy 65% in 100 epochs . But as we can see in the training performance of MobileNet , its accuracy is getting improved and it can be inferred that the accuracy will certainly be improved if we run the training for more number of epochs . However , we have shown the architecture and way to implement both the models . ResNet-50 has more number of parameters to be used so it is obvious that it will show better performance as compared to the MobileNet . <h> Provide your comments below <p> Vaibhav Kumar has experience in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning , including research and development .

REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay/File Photo <p> HONG KONG : Huawei Technologies unveiled on Wednesday a new database management system , in a bid to expand its enterprise business and challenge Western rivals such as Oracle Corp in China , amid growing scrutiny over its main telecom business . <p> Huawei said in a statement its new database management software , called GaussDB , is backed by artificial intelligence and works locally as well as on clouds . <p> The move comes amid growing international scrutiny over Huawei 's main telecom equipment business as Washington tries to persuade its allies that Huawei posed national security risks . <p> Huawei is trying to grow its nascent enterprise service business , a segment accounting for around 10 percent of its revenue , while its smartphone business continues to grow its share in a shrinking global market . <p> Industry consultancy IDC said in a report this month that China 's cloud system and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2023 from $105 million in 2018 driven by growing demand for cloud service .

"<p> When the Chinese action movie "" Wolf Warrior II "" arrived in theatres , in July , it looked like a standard shoot-'em-up , with a lonesome hero and frequent explosions . Within two weeks , however , "" Wolf Warrior II "" had become the highest-grossing Chinese movie of all time . Some crowds gave it standing ovations ; others sang the national anthem . In October , China selected it as its official entry in the foreign-language category of the Academy Awards . <p> The hero , Leng Feng , played by the action star Wu Jing ( who also directed the film ) , is a veteran of the "" wolf warriors , "" special forces of the People 's Liberation Army . In retirement , he works as a guard in a fictional African country , on the frontier of China 's ventures abroad . A rebel army , backed by Western mercenaries , attempts to seize power , and the country is engulfed in civil war . Leng shepherds civilians to the gates of the Chinese Embassy , where the Ambassador wades into the battle and declares , "" Stand down ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rebels hold their fire , and survivors are spirited to safety aboard a Chinese battleship . <p> Leng rescues an American doctor , who tells him that the Marines will come to their aid . "" But where are they now ? "" he asks her . She calls the American consulate and gets a recorded message : "" Unfortunately , we are closed . "" In the final battle , a villain , played by the American actor Frank Grillo , tells Leng , "" People like you will always be inferior to people like me . Get used to it . "" Leng beats the villain to death and replies , "" That was fucking history . "" The film closes with the image of a Chinese passport and the words "" Do n't give up if you run into danger abroad . Please remember , a strong motherland will always have your back ! "" <p> When I moved to Beijing , in 2005 , little of that story would have made sense to a Chinese audience . With doses of invention and schmalz , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Navy conducted its first international evacuation , rescuing civilians from fighting in Yemen ; last year , China opened its first overseas military base , in Djibouti . There has been a deeper development as well . For decades , Chinese nationalism revolved around victimhood : the bitter legacy of invasion and imperialism , and the memory of a China so weak that , at the end of the nineteenth century , the philosopher Liang Qichao called his country "" the sick man of Asia . "" "" Wolf Warrior II "" captures a new , muscular iteration of China 's self-narrative , much as Rambo 's heroics expressed the swagger of the Reagan era . <p> Recently , I met Wu Jing in Los Angeles , where he was promoting the movie in advance of the Academy Awards . Wu is forty-three , with short , spiky hair , a strong jaw , and an air of prickly bravado . He was on crutches , the result of "" jumping off too many buildings , "" he told me , in Chinese . ( He speaks little English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies were about , say , the Opium Wars -- how other countries waged war against China , "" he said . "" But Chinese people have always wanted to see that our country could , one day , have the power to protect its own people and contribute to peace in the world . "" <p> As a favored son of China , celebrated by the state , Wu does n't complain about censorship and propaganda . He went on , "" Although we 're not living in a peaceful time , we live in a peaceful country . I do n't think we should be spending much energy thinking about negative aspects that would make us unhappy . Cherish this moment ! "" <p> "" Wolf Warrior II "" Captures China 's Newfound Identity An interview with Wu Jing , the star and director of the film . <p> China has never seen such a moment , when its pursuit of a larger role in the world coincides with America 's pursuit of a smaller one . Ever since the Second World War , the United States has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judiciary , human rights , free trade , and protection of the environment . It planted those ideas in the rebuilding of Germany and Japan , and spread them with alliances around the world . In March , 1959 , President Eisenhower argued that America 's authority could not rest on military power alone . "" We could be the wealthiest and the most mighty nation and still lose the battle of the world if we do not help our world neighbors protect their freedom and advance their social and economic progress , "" he said . "" It is not the goal of the American people that the United States should be the richest nation in the graveyard of history . "" <p> Under the banner of "" America First , "" President Trump is reducing U.S. commitments abroad . On his third day in office , he withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership , a twelve-nation trade deal designed by the United States as a counterweight to a rising China . To allies in Asia , the withdrawal damaged America 's credibility . "" You wo n't be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prime Minister of Singapore , told me , at an event in Washington . "" It 's like when you draw a red line and then you do n't take it seriously . Was there pain ? You did n't see it , but I 'm quite sure there 's an impact . "" <p> Advertisement <p> In a speech to Communist Party officials last January 20th , Major General Jin Yinan , a strategist at China 's National Defense University , celebrated America 's pullout from the trade deal . "" We are quiet about it , "" he said . "" We repeatedly state that Trump ' harms China . ' We want to keep it that way . In fact , he has given China a huge gift . That is the American withdrawal from T.P.P. "" Jin , whose remarks later circulated , told his audience , "" As the U.S. retreats globally , China shows up . "" <p> For years , China 's leaders predicted that a time would come -- perhaps midway through this century -- when it could project its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , "" that time has come far sooner than expected . <p> Barack Obama 's foreign policy was characterized as leading from behind . Trump 's doctrine may come to be understood as retreating from the front . Trump has severed American commitments that he considers risky , costly , or politically unappealing . In his first week in office , he tried to ban travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries , arguing that they pose a terrorist threat . ( After court battles , a version of the ban took effect in December . ) He announced his intention to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement on climate change and from UNESCO , and he abandoned United Nations talks on migration . He has said that he might renege on the Iran nuclear deal , a free-trade agreement with South Korea , and NAFTA . His proposal for the 2018 budget would cut foreign assistance by forty-two per cent , or $11.5 billion , and it reduces American funding for development projects , such as those financed by the World Bank . In December , Trump threatened to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel . ( The next day , in defiance of Trump 's threat , the resolution passed overwhelmingly . ) <p> To frame his vision of a smaller presence abroad , Trump often portrays America 's urgent task as one of survival . As he put it during the campaign , "" At what point do you say , ' Hey , we have to take care of ourselves ' ? So , you know , I know the outer world exists and I 'll be very cognizant of that , but , at the same time , our country is disintegrating . "" <p> So far , Trump has proposed reducing U.S. contributions to the U.N . by forty per cent , and pressured the General Assembly to cut six hundred million dollars from its peacekeeping budget . In his first speech to the U.N. , in September , Trump ignored its collective spirit and celebrated sovereignty above all , saying , "" As President of the United States , I will always put America first , just like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and should always put your countries first . "" <p> China 's approach is more ambitious . In recent years , it has taken steps to accrue national power on a scale that no country has attempted since the Cold War , by increasing its investments in the types of assets that established American authority in the previous century : foreign aid , overseas security , foreign influence , and the most advanced new technologies , such as artificial intelligence . It has become one of the leading contributors to the U.N . ' s budget and to its peacekeeping force , and it has joined talks to address global problems such as terrorism , piracy , and nuclear proliferation . <p> And China has embarked on history 's most expensive foreign infrastructure plan . Under the Belt and Road Initiative , it is building bridges , railways , and ports in Asia , Africa , and beyond . If the initiative 's cost reaches a trillion dollars , as predicted , it will be more than seven times that of the Marshall Plan , which the U.S. launched in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today 's dollars , on rebuilding postwar Europe . <p> China is also seizing immediate opportunities presented by Trump . Days before the T.P.P. withdrawal , President Xi Jinping spoke at the World Economic Forum , in Davos , Switzerland , a first for a paramount Chinese leader . Xi reiterated his support for the Paris climate deal and compared protectionism to "" locking oneself in a dark room . "" He said , "" No one will emerge as a winner in a trade war . "" This was an ironic performance -- for decades , China has relied on protectionism -- but Trump provided an irresistible opening . China is negotiating with at least sixteen countries to form the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership , a free-trade zone that excludes the United States , which it proposed in 2012 as a response to the T.P.P. If the deal is signed next year , as projected , it will create the world 's largest trade bloc , by population . <p> Some of China 's growing sway is unseen by the public . In October , the World Trade Organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the kind of routine diplomatic session that updates rules on trade in agriculture and seafood . The Trump Administration , which has been critical of the W.T.O. , sent an official who delivered a speech and departed early . "" For two days of meetings , there were no Americans , "" a former U.S. official told me . "" And the Chinese were going into every session and chortling about how they were now guarantors of the trading system . "" <p> By setting more of the world 's rules , China hopes to "" break the Western moral advantage , "" which identifies "" good and bad "" political systems , as Li Ziguo , at the China Institute of International Studies , has said . In November , 2016 , Meng Hongwei , a Chinese vice-minister of public security , became the first Chinese president of Interpol , the international police organization ; the move alarmed human-rights groups , because Interpol has been criticized for helping authoritarian governments target and harass dissidents and pro-democracy activists abroad . <p> By some measures , the U.S. will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least twelve aircraft carriers . China has two . The U.S. has collective defense treaties with more than fifty countries . China has one , with North Korea . Moreover , China 's economic path is complicated by heavy debts , bloated state-owned enterprises , rising inequality , and slowing growth . The workers who once powered China 's boom are graying . China 's air , water , and soil are disastrously polluted . <p> And yet the gap has narrowed . In 2000 , the U.S. accounted for thirty-one per cent of the global economy , and China accounted for four per cent . Today , the U.S. 's share is twenty-four per cent and China 's fifteen per cent . If its economy surpasses America 's in size , as experts predict , it will be the first time in more than a century that the world 's largest economy belongs to a non-democratic country . At that point , China will play a larger role in shaping , or thwarting , values such as competitive elections , freedom of expression , and an open Internet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we might guess . Last year , the Pew Research Center asked people in thirty-seven countries which leader would do the right thing when it came to world affairs . They chose Xi Jinping over Donald Trump , twenty-eight per cent to twenty-two per cent . <p> Facing criticism for his lack of interest in global leadership , Trump , in December , issued a national-security strategy that singled out China and Russia and declared , "" We will raise our competitive game to meet that challenge , to protect American interests , and to advance our values . "" But , in his speech unveiling the strategy , he hailed his pullout from "" job-killing deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the very expensive and unfair Paris climate accord . "" The next day , Roger Cohen , of the Times , described the contradictions of Trump 's foreign policy as a "" farce . "" Some allies have taken to avoiding the Administration . "" I 'll tell you , honestly , for a foreigner , in the past we were used to going to the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , India 's former foreign secretary and national-security adviser to the Prime Minister , told me . "" Now we go to the corporations , to Congress , to the Pentagon , wherever . "" <p> Advertisement <p> On his recent visit to Washington , Prime Minister Lee , of Singapore , said that the rest of the world can no longer pretend to ignore the contrasts between American and Chinese leadership . "" Since the war , you 've held the peace . You 've provided security . You 've opened your markets . You 've developed links across the Pacific , "" he said . "" And now , with a rising set of players on the west coast of the Pacific , where does America want to go ? Do you want to be engaged ? "" He went on , "" If you are not there , then everybody else in the world will look around and say , I want to be friends with both the U.S. and the Chinese -- and the Chinese are ready , and I 'll start with them . "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump might prefer . Last fall , he started his second term with more unobstructed power than any Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping , who died in 1997 . The Nineteenth Party Congress , held in October , had the spirit of a coronation , in which the Party declared Xi the "" core leader , "" an honor conferred only three other times since the founding of the nation ( on Mao Zedong , Deng , and Jiang Zemin ) , and added "" Xi Jinping Thought "" to its constitution -- effectively allowing him to hold power for life , if he chooses . He enjoys total dominion over the media : at the formal unveiling of his new Politburo , the Party barred Western news organizations that it finds troublesome ; when Xi appeared on front pages across the country , his visage was a thing of perfection , airbrushed by Party "" news workers "" to the sheen of a summer peach . <p> For decades , China avoided directly challenging America 's primacy in the global order , instead pursuing a strategy that Deng , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your time . "" But Xi , in his speech to the Party Congress , declared the dawn of "" a new era , "" one in which China moves "" closer to center stage . "" He presented China as "" a new option for other countries , "" calling this alternative to Western democracy the zhongguo fang'an , the "" Chinese solution . "" <p> When I arrived in Beijing a few weeks later , the pipe organ of Chinese propaganda was at full force . The state press ran a profile of Xi that was effusive even by the standards of the form , depicting him as an "" unrivalled helmsman , "" whose "" extensive knowledge of literature and the arts makes him a consummate communicator in the international arena . "" The article observed , "" Xi treats everyone with sincerity , warmth , attentiveness , and forthrightness . "" It quoted a Russian linguist who had translated his Party Congress speech : "" I read from morning till midnight , even forgetting to have meals . "" <p> Xi has inscribed on his country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up "" low-end population "" has evicted migrant workers from Beijing , and a campaign against dissent has evicted the most outspoken intellectuals from online debate . The Party is reaching deeper into private institutions . Foreign universities with programs in China , such as Duke , have been advised that they must elevate a Communist Party secretary to a decision-making role on their local boards of trustees . The Party is encouraging dark imaginings about the outside world : posters warn the public to "" protect national secrets "" and to watch out for "" spies . "" Beijing is more convenient than it was not long ago , but also less thrilling ; it has gained wealth but lost some of its improvisational energy . <p> Until recently , Chinese nationalists were crowded out by a widespread desire to be embraced by the outside world . They see the parallel ascents of Xi and Trump as cause for celebration , and accuse "" white lotuses , "" their term for Chinese liberals , of sanctimony and intolerance . They reject political correctness in issues of race and worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up less than two per cent of China 's population , are the objects of fevered animosity on its Internet . ) Last June , Yao Chen , one of China 's most popular actresses , received a barrage of criticism online after she tried to raise awareness of the global refugee crisis . ( She was forced to clarify that she was not calling for China to accept refugees . ) <p> Back in 2008 , I met a jittery young conservative named Rao Jin , a contrarian on the fringes of Chinese politics . Long before Trump launched his campaign or railed against the media , Rao created a Web site called Anti-CNN.com , which was dedicated to criticizing Western news coverage . Over lunch in Beijing recently , he exuded calm vindication . "" Things that we used to push are now mainstream , "" not only in China but globally , he said . In Rao 's view , Trump 's "" America First "" slogan is an honest declaration , a realist vision stripped of false altruism and piety . "" From his perspective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "" To Chinese people , this is a big truth , and you ca n't deny it . "" Rao has watched versions of his ideas gain strength in Russia , France , Great Britain , and the United States . "" In this world , power speaks , "" he said , making a fist , a gesture that Trump adopted in his Inauguration speech and Xi displayed in a photo taken at the start of his new term . <p> China 's leaders rarely air their views about an American President , but well-connected scholars -- the ranking instituteniks of Beijing and Shanghai and Guangzhou -- can map the contours of their assessments . Yan Xuetong is the dean of Tsinghua University 's Institute of Modern International Relations . At sixty-five , Yan is bouncy and trim , with short silver hair and a roaring laugh . When I arrived at his office one evening , he donned a black wool cap and coat , and we set off into the cold . Before I could ask a question , he said , "" I think Trump is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is known as the leader who led an empire to collapse . "" The United States will suffer , "" he warned . <p> Over a dinner of dumplings , tofu , and stir-fried pork , Yan said that America 's strength must be measured partly by its ability to persuade : "" American leadership has already dramatically declined in the past ten months . In 1991 , when Bush , Sr. , launched the war against Iraq , it got thirty-four countries to join the war effort . This time , if Trump launched a war against anyone , I doubt he would get support from even five countries . Even the U.S. Congress is trying to block his ability to start a nuclear war against North Korea . "" For Chinese leaders , Yan said , "" Trump is the biggest strategic opportunity . "" I asked Yan how long he thought the opportunity would last . "" As long as Trump stays in power , "" he replied . <p> The leadership in Beijing did not always have this view of Trump . In the years leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confrontational posture toward the United States . Beijing worked with Washington on climate change and on the Iran nuclear deal , but tensions were building : China was hacking U.S. industrial secrets , building airports on top of reefs and rocks in the South China Sea , creating obstacles for American firms investing in China , blocking American Internet businesses , and denying visas to American scholars and journalists . During the campaign , China specialists in both parties called on the next President to strengthen alliances across Asia and to step up pressure on Beijing . <p> When Trump won , the Party "" was in a kind of shock , "" Michael Pillsbury , a former Pentagon aide and the author of "" The Hundred-Year Marathon , "" a 2015 account of China 's global ambitions , told me . "" They feared that he was their mortal enemy . "" The leadership drafted potential strategies for retaliation , including threatening American companies in China and withholding investment from the districts of influential members of Congress . <p> Most of all , they studied Trump . Kevin Rudd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contact with leaders in Beijing , told me , "" Since the Chinese were stunned that Trump was elected , they were intrinsically respectful of how he could 've achieved it . An entire battery of think tanks was set to work , to analyze how this had occurred and how Trump had negotiated his way through to prevail . "" <p> Advertisement <p> Before he entered the White House , China started assembling a playbook for dealing with him . Shen Dingli , a foreign-affairs specialist at Fudan University , in Shanghai , explained that Trump is "" very similar to Deng Xiaoping , "" the pragmatic Party boss who opened China to economic reform . "" Deng Xiaoping said , ' Whatever can make China good is a good "" ism . "" ' He does n't care if it 's capitalism . For Trump , it 's all about jobs , "" Shen said . <p> The first test came less than a month after the election , when Trump took a call from Taiwan 's President , Tsai Ing-wen . "" Xi Jinping was angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great effort not to create a war of words . "" Instead , a few weeks later , Xi revealed a powerful new intercontinental ballistic missile . "" It sends a message : I have this -- what do you want to do ? "" Shen said . "" Meantime , he sends Jack Ma "" -- the founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba -- "" to meet with Trump in New York , offering one million jobs through Alibaba . "" Shen went on , "" China knows Trump can be unpredictable , so we have weapons to make him predictable , to contain him . He would trade Taiwan for jobs . "" <p> Inside the new White House , there were two competing strategies on China . One , promoted by Stephen Bannon , then the chief strategist , wanted the President to take a hard line , even at the risk of a trade war . Bannon often described China as a "" civilizational challenge . "" The other view was associated with Jared Kushner , Trump 's son-in-law and adviser , who had received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ambassador , Cui Tiankai . Kushner argued for a close , collegial bond between Xi and Trump , and he prevailed . <p> He and Rex Tillerson , the Secretary of State , arranged for Trump and Xi to meet at Mar-a-Lago on April 7th , for a cordial get-to-know-you summit . To set the tone , Trump presented two of Kushner and Ivanka Trump 's children , Arabella and Joseph , who sang "" Jasmine Flower , "" a classic Chinese ballad , and recited poetry . While Xi was at the resort , the Chinese government approved three trademark applications from Ivanka 's company , clearing the way for her to sell jewelry , handbags , and spa services in China . <p> Kushner has faced scrutiny for potential conflicts of interest arising from his China diplomacy and his family 's businesses . During the transition , Kushner dined with Chinese business executives while the Kushner Companies was seeking their investment in a Manhattan property . ( After that was revealed in news reports , the firm ended the talks . ) In May , Kushner 's sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his White House position while she courted investors during a trip to China . The Kushner Companies apologized . <p> During the Mar-a-Lago meetings , Chinese officials noticed that , on some of China 's most sensitive issues , Trump did not know enough to push back . "" Trump is taking what Xi Jinping says at face value -- on Tibet , Taiwan , North Korea , "" Daniel Russel , who was , until March , the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs , told me . "" That was a big lesson for them . "" Afterward , Trump conceded to the Wall Street Journal how little he understood about China 's relationship to North Korea : "" After listening for ten minutes , I realized it 's not so easy . "" <p> Russel spoke to Chinese officials after the Mar-a-Lago visit . "" The Chinese felt like they had Trump 's number , "" he said . "" Yes , there is this random , unpredictable Ouija-board quality to him that worries them , and they have to brace for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' He 's a paper tiger . ' Because he has n't delivered on any of his threats . There 's no wall on Mexico . There 's no repeal of health care . He ca n't get the Congress to back him up . He 's under investigation . "" <p> After the summit , the Pangoal Institution , a Beijing think tank , published an analysis of the Trump Administration , describing it as a den of warring "" cliques , "" the most influential of which was the "" Trump family clan . "" The Trump clan appears to "" directly influence final decisions "" on business and diplomacy in a way that "" has rarely been seen in the political history of the United States , "" the analyst wrote . He summed it up using an obscure phrase from feudal China : jiatianxia -- "" to treat the state as your possession . "" <p> After Mar-a-Lago , Trump heaped praise on Xi . "" We had a great chemistry , I think . I mean , at least I had a great chemistry -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he liked me , "" he said on the Fox Business Network . Meanwhile , Chinese analysts were struggling to keep up with the news about the rise and fall of White House advisers . Following a report that Tillerson had disparaged the President 's intelligence , Shen , of Fudan University , asked me , "" What is a moron ? "" <p> By early November , Trump was preparing for his first trip to Beijing . Some China specialists in the U.S. government saw it as a chance to press on substantive issues . "" We have to start standing up for our interests , because they have come farther , and faster , than people thought , pretty much without anyone waking up to it , "" a U.S. official involved in planning the visit told me . Among other things , the U.S. wanted China to open up areas of its economy , such as cloud computing , to foreign competitors ; crack down on the theft of intellectual property ; and stop forcing American firms to transfer technology as a condition for entry to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of urgency , "" the official said . <p> Cui Tiankai , the Chinese Ambassador to Washington , billed Trump 's visit as a "" state visit plus . "" An American with high-level contacts in Beijing told me that they planned to "" wow him with five thousand years of Chinese history . They believe he is uniquely susceptible to that . "" <p> The strategy had worked before . In the mid-nineteen-eighties , the C.I.A . commissioned a China scholar named Richard Solomon to write a handbook for American leaders , "" Chinese Political Negotiating Behavior . "" Solomon , whose study was later declassified , noted that some of China 's most effective techniques were best described in the nineteenth century , when a Manchu prince named Qiying recorded his preferred approach . "" Barbarians , "" Qiying noted , respond well to "" receptions and entertainment , after which they have had a feeling of appreciation . "" Solomon warned that modern Chinese leaders "" use the trappings of imperial China "" to "" impress foreign officials with their grandeur and seriousness of purpose . "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' old friend ' or the sentimentality that Chinese hospitality readily evokes . "" ( Henry Kissinger , he wrote , once gushed to his hosts , "" After a dinner of Peking duck I 'll agree to anything . "" ) <p> Following the Nineteenth Party Congress , Trump marvelled at Xi 's new power . "" Now some people might call him the king of China , "" he told an interviewer , shortly before his trip . Trump arrived in more modest standing . A few hours before his plane touched down , on November 8th , Republicans were thumped in state elections , losing governors ' races in Virginia and New Jersey . His approval rating was thirty-seven per cent , the lowest of any President at that point in his tenure since Gallup started measuring it . Three former aides had been charged with felonies in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election . It was the first summit since 1972 in which the American President had less leverage and political security than his Chinese counterpart . <p> Advertisement <p> Xi deftly flattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sunset tour of the Forbidden City . They drank tea , watched an opera performance at the Pavilion of Pleasant Sounds , and admired an antique gold urn . The next morning , at the Great Hall of the People , Trump was greeted by an even more lavish ceremony , with Chinese military bands , the firing of cannons , and throngs of schoolchildren , who waved colored pompoms and yelled , in Chinese , "" Uncle Trump ! "" Government censors struck down critical comments about Trump on social media . <p> Trump and Xi met for several hours and then appeared before the press . "" The hosting of the military parade this morning was magnificent , "" Trump said , and he praised Xi as a "" highly respected and powerful representative of his people . "" He mentioned the need to co ? perate with regard to North Korea , and to fix an "" unfair "" trade relationship , but he said nothing about intellectual property or market access . "" I do n't blame China , "" Trump said . "" Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of another country for the benefit of its citizens ? "" There were gasps from business leaders and journalists . "" I give China great credit . "" Some Chinese members of the audience cheered . Xi and Trump took no questions from the press . <p> In preparations for Trump 's meeting with Xi , the State Department had urged the President to bring up a human-rights case : that of the poet Liu Xia , the widow of the late Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo , who is under house arrest , without charges . According to two U.S. officials , Trump never mentioned it . <p> Trump 's deference to Xi -- the tributes and tender musings about chemistry -- sent a message to other countries that are debating whether to tilt toward the U.S. or China . Daniel Russel said , "" The American President is here . He 's looking in awe at the Forbidden City . He 's looking in awe at Xi Jinping , and he 's choosing China because of its market , because of its power . If you thought that America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaties and twentieth-century values , instead of Xi Jinping and the Chinese market , well , think again . "" <p> In concrete terms , why does it matter if America retreats and China advances ? One realm in which the effects are visible is technology , where Chinese and American companies are competing not simply for profits but also to shape the rules concerning privacy , fairness , and censorship . China bars eleven of the world 's twenty-five most popular Web sites -- including Google , YouTube , Facebook , and Wikipedia -- because it fears they will dominate local competitors or amplify dissent . The Chinese government has promoted that approach under a doctrine that it calls "" cyber-sovereignty . "" In December , China hosted an Internet conference that attracted American C.E.O.s such as Tim Cook , of Apple , even though China has forced Apple to remove apps that allow users to circumvent the "" Great Firewall .

The company was founded in 2014 by Tang Xiao'ou , a computer scientist who trained at M.I.T. and returned to Hong Kong to teach .

Of the forty-one private companies worldwide that reached "" unicorn "" status in 2017 -- meaning they had valuations of a billion dollars or more -- fifteen are Chinese and seventeen are American . ) <p> SenseTime 's offices have a sleek , industrial look .

"<p> Financial institutions ( FIs ) worked quickly to ensure they could operate smoothly as the pandemic kept consumers at home and closed brick-and-mortar branches in Europe , the United Kingdom and the United States . <p> Many banks braced themselves for an oncoming surge in the number of consumers accessing their financial accounts online or via mobile banking apps , but safely and seamlessly providing that access remained tricky for many in the space . <p> This is because many legacy FIs in particular are still reliant upon legacy infrastructure , which is simply not designed to handle the sheer volume of data generated in today 's digital banking sphere . The use of the cloud to upgrade core banking platforms has become more intriguing to today 's FIs as they struggle to meet this increasing demand , but migration challenges to cloud-based platforms still abound . <p> In the June edition of the Digital Banks And The Power Of The Cloud Tracker ? , PYMNTS examines how the pandemic is affecting cloud migration of legacy FIs as well as how the pandemic may be impacting the ongoing consumer shift to online and mobile banking tools . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help FIs stay on top of that shift . <p> Developments Around the Cloud Banking World <p> Utah-based FI Continental Bank is one such entity tapping cloud technology to bring more flexibility to its financial solutions as the pandemic makes seamless digital services more critical . The bank will be working with a third-party cloud technology provider to develop a new digital core , which it will use to further support online banking for small- to medium-sized businesses ( SMBs ) . It will be relying upon its new cloud-supported platform to craft newer products for quicker deposits and easier lending , according to company statements . Cloud technology aids in this endeavor by making it much easier to handle larger amounts of data and to process online transactions more quickly , and will thus allow Continental Bank to serve more SMBs . <p> Spanish bank CaixaBank is another FI looking to upgrade its online banking platform through the use of cloud-based technologies . The bank will be expanding its existing relationship with technology and software provider IBM to create digital products which will use the cloud to more easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will then tailor that data to provide more personalized insights to their customers . The insights will run off IBM 's cloud-based servers , which also make use of automated and artificial intelligence ( AI ) -supported solutions for greater efficiency . <p> Pacific National Bank ( PNB ) , meanwhile , is using cloud core banking tools to support and launch a new digital-only financial brand which it is calling FACILE . The FI officially opened the digital platform to U.S. customers in late May . PNB is also teaming up with a third-party cloud technology provider for FACILE 's services , which are tailored to today 's more digitally-minded consumers . FACILE will be marketed as a competitor to other digital-only banks making headway in the U.S. , such as Monzo and N26 . It will use cloud technology to underpin FACILE 's offerings , especially the digital payment services it provides . <p> For more on these and other stories , visit the Tracker 's News &amp; Trends . <p> How N26 Is Using Cloud Core Banking for Nimble Mobile Innovation <p> Consumers were already leaning on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders and bank branches to either close or limit their hours . The pandemic accelerated this shift to mobile banking , and many customers both existing and new are choosing to interact with their FIs through their mobile phone screens as their primary channel , even as states reopen . This means that FIs must prepare to conduct seamless and personalized relationships with a high volume of consumers who are now mobile-first , a pivot that can be difficult when many FIs are still relying on older infrastructures . <p> Using the cloud as one 's banking core allows much more flexibility , says Lindsey Grossman , director of product for digital challenger bank N26 , in an interview with PYMNTS .

"<h> America , as usual <h> Share this : <p> The US Congress ' response to the Covid-19 epidemic has been shambolic . Photo : iStock <p> The fiasco of the Coronavirus Rescue Package shows that in the US , all 's business as usual . As American leadership finally awakens to the gripping reality that the world they hold so dear may collapse in front of their eyes , Covid-19 is wrecking its way through the economy all the way to the Senate floor , where policymakers continue to debate the specifics of the much-anticipated stimulus package . <p> On the rainy morning of March 23 , lawmakers in DC failed to reach an agreement on the specifics of the US$2 trillion bill when Democrats again voted against its christening . The result : pandemonium on Capitol Hill . As a nice reminder , while these elected officials may "" care "" about the majority of Americans who now must struggle with financial uncertainty amid institutional collapse , it would n't be American politics without the rich and powerful making a nice buck from the crisis . <p> The current deadlock follows the "" Phase 2 "" coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At that time , policymakers anticipated that "" Phase 3 "" would give $50 billion in aid to the airline industry , roughly $150 billion for other hard-hit sectors of the economy , and two rounds of direct payments on April 6 and May 18 to affected individuals totaling $250 billion . Five days of coronavirus hell taught policymakers that their numbers were too low . <p> The impasse over "" Phase 3 "" lies in its specifics : Democrats say the bill operates as a classic bailout that fails to give adequate assistance to families and laid-off workers . What 's more , the bill currently authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to dispense the funds at his discretion , a glaring lack of accountability that may see federal funds allocated without any oversight . <p> The Republicans counter by blaming the Democrats for playing party politics and not respecting the urgency the situation to take immediate action before more people lose their jobs . <h> World 's ' wealthiest economy ' <p> Within the lobbying networks of DC , not so small businesses promise that without liquidity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further send the world 's "" wealthiest economy "" into a spiral of economic collapse . Yet one wonders whether these corporations , including the airlines that have monopolized market share at the expense of the consumer and spent billions buying back their own stock over the past decade , would have to lay people off anyway if there is no resurgent demand , even with the nice cushion of the bailout softening the fall . <p> As millions of workers caught in the turmoil of capitalism with "" neoliberal characteristics "" embrace the reality of no pay and no health care , moderates must wake up to the reality that the conventional economic wisdom of the past few decades is not only bogus but also the main reason American life has become so unstable . <p> Yes , the stimulus package fails to include oversight mechanisms . Indeed , nothing in the bill prevents the corporate recipients from using the funds to buy back their own stock or take other self-defensive measures . And if the past is any indicator of present behavior , executives tend to relieve their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package fails to compensate people adequately -- granting a one-time payment of only $1,200 for every adult and $500 per child . And really examining the bill reveals that many low-income households would only be left with a paltry $600 to navigate the turbulence . <p> But the real problem is just how silly these figures seem when compared with the reality on the ground . A reality shaped by decades of economic policies that see corporations as the real drivers of life and the role of government to simply stay out of the way . A reality that treats low-income workers as disposable and not worthy of protection . A reality that means the world 's wealthiest economy could fall apart in a matter of weeks . <h> Made in its own image <p> Critics of neoliberalism have talked about the fragility of the American system for years . This fragility can really be seen in the staggering costs of living in the US and how businesses generally treat their workers . <p> And herein lies a great paradox . <p> From 1980 onward , while the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chains and international trade , the cost of social mobility ( and basic human necessities like health care , education and housing ) skyrocketed because of the mismatched appreciation of assets in the banking system . <p> This process of financialization -- or the trend of large corporate businesses making their profits from financial markets rather than producing goods or services -- set up the dynamic we see in the US today : an economy that cares more for its shareholders than its workers . <p> Indeed , anybody who wants to defend conventional wisdom about the benign intentions of corporate America or the business-lobbying nexus need only to look at another piece of coronavirus-related legislation signed into law last week . <p> The ultimate irony is that the very corporate stakeholders that are pleading to Congress for funds in the name of preventing mass layoffs successfully lobbied Congress to include a provision in last week 's Families First Coronavirus Response Act that exempts companies with more than 500 employees from having to provide paid sick leave . This means that the businesses with the most money in the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick , they must fend for themselves . <p> The largest employers in the US , including Walmart and McDonald 's , do n't give their employees paid sick leave and severely limit the benefits that part-time workers can receive such as paid time off and rudimentary health insurance . Even Amazon , a company now boasting of its efforts to address the Covid-19 pandemic , will not provide paid sick leave to its workers unless they have been tested positive for the coronavirus , a virtual impossibility in America . And this paid leave lasts only for two weeks ! <p> After only one week of widespread "" social distancing "" we Americans are beginning to see chaos . A small injection of money for families living paycheck-to-paycheck will do little to combat potential months of closed businesses and services , or worse , a trip to the hospital . <p> As businesses continue to close and millions of American workers find they are without a source of income and health insurance , the real effect of economic recession will kick in fast . The structural instability of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at best wrong and at worst casuistic manipulation and sophistry . <p> Without a change or more action , the people who cherish this world so much might have to watch as violence unfolds .

"<h> CRUP Tool Makes Enhancer Prediction Quick and Easy <p> It is the the dream of every molecular geneticist : an easy-to-use program that compares data sets from different cellular conditions , identifies enhancer regions and then assigns them to their target genes . A research team led by Martin Vingron at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin has now developed a program that masters all of this . <p> "" DNA is pretty boring , since it is practically the same in every cell , "" says Martin Vingron , Director and Head of the Department of Bioinformatics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin . "" When the genome is like the book of life , I am most interested in the side notes . "" These "" notes "" are small chemical marks attached to the DNA molecule that do not alter the genetic information itself , but influence what happens to the DNA at the respective site . In other words , these marks have an epigenetic effect . They serve as regulators of genomic regions that are responsible for the activation and deactivation of genes , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the epigenetic control of genes does not work correctly and is of great interest for scientists . The analysis of these regions in the lab , however , is often cumbersome , time-consuming and complicated . That 's why Vingron and his team decided to develop a new program package called Condition-specific Regulatory Units Prediction ( CRUP ) which simplifies analysis and solves several practical problems . <p> "" We wanted to combine the common steps in the process of enhancer prediction in a simple , universal program , "" says bioinformatician Verena Heinrich who developed the package . CRUP simplifies the analysis in many regards . The machine learning algorithm is not limited to specific cell- or tissue-types . It does not need to be recalibrated prior to each analysis of a data set and allows comparative study of several data series . The tool , which was developed by Heinrich and doctoral student Anna Ramisch , is still easy to use . <p> The enhancer 's stimulating activity <p> CRUP specifically identifies and characterizes enhancers - DNA segments that stimulate or "" enhance "" the transcription of genes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which function as a switch for each gene . However , which enhancer controls the right genes at correct time often remains a mystery . "" Enhancers and their associated genes can be located far away from each other , "" says Heinrich . "" This makes it difficult for us to assign the regulatory sequences to their respective targets . "" <p> The genome contains hundreds of thousands of enhancers which are active in different phases in the life of a cell like during growth , maintenance , or disease . When the DNA is tightly packed like a wool thread on spools of carrier proteins called histones , the regulatory sequences are in a "" resting "" state . They only become active by chemical modifications to the histone proteins . Then , sections unwrap from the DNA clusters , get exposed , and become accessible to molecules that activate genes . The analysis of histone proteins by chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) in tandem with DNA sequencing then reveals which enhancers are active and which are not . <p> In three steps to a complete analysis <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program . CRUP first examines all sequences and then decides whether it is an enhancer or not . The classification algorithm is based on artificial intelligence , which is trained with information from mouse embryonic stem cells . It detects enhancer regions in many other animal species or tissues , as Heinrich and her colleagues demonstrated on a diverse set of data provided by the German Epigenome Program ( DEEP ) . <p> In the second step , CRUP can be fed multiple data sets and the program finds where they differ . This makes it possible to interpret a series of measurements or pinpoint differences between tissues . Epigenetic changes to enhancers become apparent - over time , or when comparing healthy and diseased tissues . The third and final step of the analysis is the mapping of genes to their respective enhancers . "" We asked : What part of the genome is active at the same time in the same place ? "" explains Heinrich . To achieve this , CRUP links the enhancer analysis with transcription data that reveal which genes are active , and experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other . <p> Finally , the researchers tested their program in a practical setting . They analyzed the tissue of mice with the immune disease rheumatoid arthritis and compared it with data from healthy animals . CRUP identified more than 200 differences in enhancer regions , some of which had already been associated with the disease in other studies . The genes that CRUP assigned to these enhancers have also been shown to play a role in disease . <p> "" Our program reliably identifies candidates for disease-associated enhancers and links them to their target genes , "" says Vingron . His team hopes the new tool will make the field more accessible as well as accelerate research to help identify the causes of complex human diseases .

"<h> Google Assistant Vs Google Now : What 's New And What 's The Difference ? <p> Google just launched its Google Pixel smartphones this morning . One of the biggest draw card for the Pixel is that it comes with Google Assistant already on-board . Google Assistant is , as the name suggests , a digital personal assistant that is activated by voice commands . It 's the next-generation of Google Now , the company 's existing voice assistant that is available across iOS and Android handsets . While Google Now is more static , Google Assistant can get to know individual users on a personal level and can do more than its predecessor . We asked Google to give us a demonstration of Assistant and we drill down on how it differs from Google Now . <h> More Stories on Google <p> Google Now is seen as a direct competitor to Apple 's Siri and Microsoft 's Cortana , but it 's essentially a glorified Google search using voice commands with extra goodies . Sure , it can help you schedule meetings on your smartphone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web services , but it does n't get to know the user at a deeper level . <p> Google Assistant aims to leverage the progress Google has made in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence ( AI ) to create a digital assistant that learns more about the user everyday ; it builds "" a Google for your world , "" as the marketing material suggests . You can have a two-way conversation with Google Assistant and it will answer back . It has all the functions that Google Now offers but it learns more about the user on a personal level . It remembers information from previous conversations and can call on them for context when interpreting new commands . <p> Here 's a live demonstration of the Google Assistant at the Pixel Australian launch event this morning : <p> Please enable JavaScript to watch this video . <p> As you can see from the demo video above , you can ask Google Assistant follow-up questions and it 's able to recall past conversations and give you a rundown of your schedule for the day . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you can fill up your car , help you book tickets to the movies . The more you use it , the more useful it becomes as it learns your preferences .

That 's what Google has said , anyway . <p> Although Google Assistant does integrate with some of Google 's web services like Gmail along with other third-party apps , it does n't work with Google 's productivity suite ( Docs , Sheets and Slides ) . Google is working on that although there we do n't know when that will happen . <p> Google Assistant is already part of Google Allo , the company 's new messaging app , and is baked into the Pixel phones .

"<h> Ignore the Prophets of Doom . Brexit Will Be Good For Britain <p> Ignore the Prophets of Doom . Brexit Will Be Good For Britain Here is the opening of this interesting opinion column by Simon Jenkins for The Guardian : <p> "" We have had no end of a lesson : it will do us no end of good ! "" So said Rudyard Kipling of the Boer war , and he might well say the same today . David Cameron 's wild European gamble has failed . He and the British establishment took democracy for granted . They lined up all the toffs and boffins , the chief executives , tycoons and clever-clogs in the ( south of the ) land , and asked the nation to pat them on the back . The invitation to a punch in the face was too good to miss . Now , with blood barely dry on their lips , project fear has mutated into project stupid-idiots . I find it staggering that the remain minority can accuse the Brexit majority of not knowing truth from lies -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant its vote . It should therefore be asked to vote a second time , and show due respect to its elders and betters . What planet are these people on ? I would guess the leavers in a second vote would soar to 60% , out of sheer fury . Brexit is starting to deliver . British politics was constipated and has now overdosed on laxative . It is experiencing a great evacuation . It has got rid of a prime minister and is about to get rid of a leader of the opposition . It will soon be rid of a chancellor of the exchequer and a lord chancellor . It is also rid of two , if not four , Tory heirs apparent . Across the spectrum the left is on the brink of upheaval and perhaps historic realignment , if only the Liberal Democrats have the guts to engineer it . The Greens and Ukip have both lost their leaders . An entire political class is on the way out . As Oscar Wilde said of the death of Little Nell , it would take a heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was persuaded neither by project fear nor by Brexit 's projected sunny uplands . I thought , and still think , time and compromise will eventually stabilise Britain 's relations with the EU as not so different from today . Whether the stabiliser is joining the European Economic Area ( within the letter , if not the spirit , of Brexit ) or some other arrangement -- who knows ? I voted remain because I felt Europe 's future to be so precarious as desperately to need Britain 's more forceful presence . I feel that more strongly after the news that the European parliament leader , Martin Schulz , wants to move the EU swiftly to a "" one government "" federal constitution . <p> David Fuller 's view For the UK , Brexit negotiations may feel like a one horse race at the Grand National -- exciting , not without risk , endurance required , and a big prize for winning . The EU would be wise to lower the fences on this course , for the sake of their 27 economies . If not , our soon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next year 's French election , which may produce a surprise . We are also likely to see a new chancellor for Germany after next year 's election . <p> Post-Brexit , the Real Risk Is Europe Could Fail Here is the opening of this topical article from Bloomberg : <p> While the short-term economic consequences of Brexit are not to be dismissed , it is the impending failure of the European project that should provoke the bigger sense of concern . The EU 's two biggest achievements since the establishment of the single market -- the euro and border-free travel -- are both under threat . These implosions would be a magnitude more painful than the British vote . The two are closely linked . European governments realized in the 1980s that competitive currency devaluations were hindering the single market , which was supposed to bring more industrial specialization and economies of scale . A single currency , they hoped , would put an end to that game , bring low German interest rates to all and enable national governments to reduce deficit and debt levels , as enshrined in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Respecting these rules would create political pain as parts of the labor force were displaced . That is where the 1985 Schengen Agreement came in . The pain of fiscal restraint and adjustment would be eased by promoting free movement . People might lose their jobs in Fiat , but they could go and work in the Ruhr . The single market had already enshrined this freedom , but Schengen made it truly palpable by removing border controls . Over time , cross-border trade , tourism and labor mobility increased markedly as a result . The freedom to retire , go on holiday or study in another EU country created important political constituencies in support of Europe . As Eurobarometer polls consistently showed , border-free travel was hugely popular . Both the euro and Schengen are now on life support . <p> David Fuller 's view It has long been basic economics 101 that you do not introduce a single currency before creating a federal state , which of course , the vast majority of citizens in Europe have never wanted . The EU 's political founders and followers ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries in the process . The EU will never recover from this in its present form . Europe can still have freedom of movement with travel and residency agreements between consenting countries . I do not see why countries could not reintroduce their former currencies , over which they would regain full control . While travelling , they could use the Euro like Bitcoin for expenses within other European countries , if they did not want to convert currencies every time they entered another European country , as in the pre-Euro era . In other words , the Euro would no longer be a national and regional reserve currency . Instead , it would just be a commercial currency which anyone could buy , sell or hold , should they wish to do so . <p> David Fuller 's view We will hear a great deal more about artificial intelligence in the years ahead . <p> Sterling Slide Is Painful But What We Need In a Global Deflation Crisis Here is the conclusion from another astute column by Ambrose Evans-Pritchard for The Telegraph : <p> It is often said that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it comes with obligatory free movement of EU migrants . This is not true . The EEA council approved immigration controls for Liechtenstein in 1997 and these later evolved into a quota system . The legal precedent exists . This is purely a political issue . If Britain and the EU wish to resolve the dispute , they can do so easily , either with the Liechtenstein model or the Ukraine association model , which allows for much the same thing . All else is posturing . What is imperative is that Conservative Party quickly dispels the narrative propagated by the entire global media that Britain is succumbing to reactionary nativism and turning its back on the post-war international order . Both the New York Times and the Washington Post ran stories after the vote deeming it to be the death of liberal globalisation . Variants of this corrosive theme have taken hold everywhere . It is a little irritating since all we have done is to take back our sovereign self-government from a deeply dysfunctional organisation that has over-reached badly , plays fast and loose with democracy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Britain is the first country to volunteer to lead one for the four NATO battalions being formed to defend the EU 's eastern border in Poland , Lithuania , Latvia , and Estonia , and the Royal Air Force patrols the Baltics , two of many commitments that are a little too lightly overlooked . Professor Alan Riley from the Institute for Statecraft says Britain should go further to demonstrate with absolute clarity to Washington and every European capital that the country is resiling from nothing and is an ally to be reckoned with . He wants three British armoured divisions deployed in Germany or beyond , a Royal Navy squadron in the Baltic , with a boost in defence spending to 3pc of GDP to silence all talk of retreat and entirely change the strategic balance in what is now a disarmed and paralysed Europe . I agree . We need this anyway because the world is turning more dangerous by the day . Sir John Holmes , a veteran diplomat and EU expert , told a forum at Chatham House this week that Britain could turn Brexit into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play our cards right and in the right spirit "" . "" Paradoxically , it may be easier to work together once we are free of our own paralysing fear of supranational institutions and of abandoning our sovereign right to our own policy . Once the divorce is complete , we should be able to escape the endless wrangling , "" he said . Sir John asked whether anybody really believes that the status quo ante was acceptable , or whether a narrow victory for Remain would ever have resolved the matter . The answer is obviously not , and if that is the case , what conclusions do you draw ? The task for the next prime minister is to convince EU leaders that it is better for everybody to have a good British neighbour rather than a truculent British tenant . She go to Brussels with a nuclear-armed smile . <p> David Fuller 's view The best part of this article , in my opinion , is the conclusion above , which I will comment on in a moment . First , I hope that the third paragraph of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Subscriber 's Area ) is an exaggeration . There is a considerable amount of positive deflation ( increased output at lower costs leading to higher profits and stronger growth ) , due to the accelerated rate of technological innovation . The problem is that technological innovation is also highly disruptive , at least initially . Consider Amazon , reaffirming its overall upward trend , or Google which needs to break its progression of lower rally highs to reaffirm demand dominance .

"<h> NASA takes first step to allow computers to decide what to tell us in search for life on Mars <p> NASA has stepped closer to allowing remote onboard computers to direct the search for life on other planets .

This will be further refined until being incorporated into the 2023 mission . <p> Victoria Da Poian continued , "" What we get from these unmanned missions is data , lots of it ; and sending data over hundreds of millions of kilometres can be very challenging in different environments and extremely expensive ; in other words , bandwidth is limited . We need to prioritize the volume of data we send back to Earth , but we also need to ensure that in doing that we do n't throw out vital information . This has led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now help the scientists with their analysis of the sample and their decision-making process regarding subsequent operations , and as a longer-term objective , algorithms that will analyze the data itself , will adjust and tune the instruments to run next operations without the ground-in-the-loop , and will transmit home only the most interesting data . "" <p> The team used the raw data from initial laboratory tests with an Earth-based MOMA instrument to train computers to recognize familiar patterns . When new raw data is received , the software tells the scientists what previously encountered samples match this new data . <p> Eric Lyness noted , "" The mission will face severe time limits . When we will be operating on Mars , samples will only remain in the rover for at most a few weeks before the rover dumps the sample and moves to a new place to drill . So , if we need to retest a sample , we need to do it quickly , sometimes within 24 hours . In the future , as we move to explore the moons of Jupiter such as Europa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will need real-time decisions to be made onsite . With these moons it can take 5 to 7 hours for a signal from Earth to reach the instruments , so this will not be like controlling a drone , with an instant response . We need to give the instruments the autonomy to make rapid decisions to reach our science goals on our behalf . "" <p> Lyness commented , "" When first gathered , the data produced by the MOMA life-searching instrument is difficult to interpret . It will not shout out "" I 've found life here , "" but will give us probabilities which will need to be analyzed . These results will largely tell us about the geochemistry that the instruments find . We 're aiming for the system to give scientists directions , for example our system might say "" I 've got 91% confidence that this sample corresponds to a real world sample and I 'm 87% sure it is phospholipids , similar to a sample tested on July 24th , 2018 and here is what that data looked like . "" We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first filter will be the AI system . "" <p> The researchers note that data is expensive to send back from Mars , and gets more expensive as landers get further from Earth . "" Data from a rover on Mars can cost as much as 100,000 times as much as data on your cell phone , so we need to make those bits as scientifically valuable as possible , "" said Eric Lyness . <p> Commenting , Dr. Joel Davis ( postdoctoral researcher in planetary geology at the Natural History Museum , London ) said , "" One of the main challenges for planetary missions is getting the data back to Earth -- it costs both time and money . On Mars , the travel time delay is around 20 minutes and this gets more the further you go out in the solar system . Given the finite lifespans of missions , scientists have to be very selective about the data they chose to bring back .

"<h> CIO 's role is to embrace change and tame digital dragons <p> Digital business has created a change-ready mindset for 77% of CIO survey respondents in Africa , according to Gartner , Inc. ' s annual CIO survey . <p> Gartner analysts presented these findings during Gartner Symposium/ITxpo , currently hosted in Cape Town this week . <p> The survey showed that 50% of CIO respondents in Africa are responsible for the digital transformation strategy of their organisation , and 43% are in charge of innovation . <p> "" CIOs in Africa are fully embracing and capitalising on digital business , "" said Tomas Nielsen , research director at Gartner . "" Among respondents from Africa , on average , 29% of organisations ' processes have been optimised through digital means . As a result , their role is moving to non-IT responsibilities , forcing them to reimagine their role within the organisation . "" <p> Most CIOs in Africa are designing and delivering digital business and becoming transformational leaders to scale and harvest . <p> "" The role of the CIO is changing from a delivery executive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - if your enterprise was looking to fill your job today , would they hire you ? , "" said Nielsen . <p> According to Gartner , CIO respondents in Africa have made significant inroads in their digital journey . The survey showed that 45% of CIOs in Africa are either designing or delivering their digital initiative , while 13% moved beyond delivery into scaling and harvesting on their digital initiatives . <p> However , the majority of CIO respondents in Africa remain in the initial stages of their digital journey -- and for these CIOs , the biggest barrier is the organisation 's culture . <p> "" Nearly half of all CIOs said that culture is the biggest barrier that prevents them from scaling their digital business transformation , "" said Nielsen . "" Their second highest challenge is shortage of resources . "" <p> This means that CIOs in Africa need to embrace a broader role beyond technology , and hone their change management and transformational leadership skills to succeed in their digital transformation journey . <p> New and increased digital investments <p> "" Digital business is clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nielsen .

"" Interest in artificial intelligence ( AI ) is also growing with most respondents indicating AI is either on their radar or a medium to long-term plan for 38 and 27 percent of CIOs in Africa , respectively , with only 2 percent having deployed AI , "" said Nielsen . <p> "" The key is to increase investment in technologies that help organisations reach their business objectives .

"" <p> She adds the scope of AI includes machine learning , natural language processing , image and speech recognition . <p> Let 's focus on machine learning . While machine learning could be applied to just about any industry , financial services have been identified as one of the sectors that could benefit greatly . <p> Of all these applications , machine learning 's unique capability in gearing financial institutions towards personalised customer services -- especially as customers are demanding for more and more personalised approaches -- is intriguing . These personalised services could be reactive or proactive . <p> Reactive means financial institutions would recommend products or services based on instructions from customers . To narrow down the options , financial institutions may even ask the customers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answers , machine learning logic would be applied to come up with recommendations . Such solutions have been deployed by online investment advisors better known as robo-advisor . <p> Proactive personalised services , on the other hand , refer to recommendations to customers based on intelligence drawn from his or her own data . <p> While this is not yet prevalent , the potential is huge because financial institutions collect tonnes of data on a daily basis . <p> For example , a typical salaried person would have his salary credited to a bank account once every month .

And it is easy to see to world moving towards the Singaporean model as technology improves and nations ' populations age . <p> In any event , the whole ' rise of the machines ' does debunk the claim that Australia needs to import large swathes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality is likely to be the opposite : too many workers chasing too few jobs as robots and artificial intelligence take over . So why , then , is Australia running one of the highest immigration programs in the world , especially given the extreme pressure that it is placing on infrastructure , housing , schools , hospitals and overall livability ? <h> Comments <p> Was just writing thses notes , here is the intro : In the past progress was popular , not just for geeks . The demise of grand 20th-century dreams and the optimistic culture . Why is gen Y is not running with the ball . Is our inability to match the achievements of the 1960s space program might be symptomatic of a general failure of our society to get big things done , "" Is our life and ambition on hold till we check with Facebook ? <p> It will be at least 20 years before robotics , AI , automation have a major impact on the Australian economy . By major impact , I mean replacing a large # of jobs . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but these are not closely linked right now . <p> Down the track , though , there is a big question as to what jobs people are going to do , not just because of robotics etc but simply because capitalism has ' evolved ' to the point where the link between growth and job creation is largely broken . But this is going to affect all countries , not just Aus . <p> My bet is we will not see fully automated self-driving trucks on Australian roads at large scale within 10 years . Even 20 is a stretch IMO . And transport is just one sector . Retail is a little more vulnerable , but again , I do nt see a large % of those jobs being automated any time soon . <p> The whole thing is massively overhyped in terms of its near-term impact . In the longer term though , its possibly under-hyped . <p> It will be 20 years after the technology has been introduced widely , and absolutely proven in a couple of other countries before our business owners try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks , such as might be the case with self driving vehicles , it will be a couple of parliaments before they are resolved . <p> 10 years maybe in Japan or Germany , at a stretch if everything goes quickly , but definitely not here . <p> Unemployed and underemployed people do n't make good house customers . Are you suggesting growing slums to grow gross gdp ? They 've already begun printing houses in China . All that 's needed is to bolt the modules together . What happens to the construction trades when that hits the big time ? Robots are already doing surgery , so how difficult can it be to have robot hairdressers , robot butchers , robot baristas , robot chefs , robot shelf stackers , etc ? Anything that has a large element of repetition is ripe for automation . <p> Leith , 99% of the population has no freaking idea about AI and the impact it will have . And I 'm not talking Skynet or singularity , this is narrow AI and machine learning . No sector will be left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing a roaring trade , ( tweed heads mall ) male and female , now has a vending machine at the entrance , where it accepts your money and gives you a ticket . No mucking around . about 5 hairdressers and a queue of often about 20 <p> Really ? ? ? Why would I want a $10 haircut ? surely a haircut is more about the experience than the result . For me a hair cut is 100% a function of human interaction , the person delivering the service has to be someone that I do n't mind touching my head , someone whose company I can enjoy for 15min , someone that leaves me in a more cheerful mood after the hair-cut than before it . When it comes to the amount , I willingly pay for these and other positive attributes , to be honest I tip my hair cutter more than $10 so that she is properly rewarded for creating a positive experience . <p> "" cb tip you man well , for they are facing extinction "" How ? Robots taking over hairdressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it will take one hell of a long time before a hairdressing robot achieves the economies required to displace millions of hairdressers worldwide . Never mind the cultural acceptance required . <p> Sadly you are wrong Dave , if machines can perform surgery , then its no great leap to cut hair , . Hairdressers , bakers , chefs , butchers , and so forth will start heading the way of the dodo within ten years , fifteen max . Only our politicians do n't give a damn about planning for this because they plan to have retired with their loot by then . <p> Think of all the examples where technology exists and this has not happened . Coffee would be a good one . Why does Melbourne have thousands of baristas and no coffee vending machines ? The technology to automate this task has existed for decades . Why do 99% of shops not have automatic check out ? Why are tax returns not all computer-automated ? What about travel , how come airlines and hotel chains all have call centres ? <p> The reasons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will also affect all the occupations that are also supposedly about to be automated . <p> If you mean ' chef "" as in someone who works in a suburbam pub bistro or RSL. sure . If you mean ' chef ' as in Jacques Reymond , Shannon Bennet or Gordon Ramsay , then no -- the whole point of eating at a place like that is the bragging rights of ' so-and-so made my food last night ' . An automated process misses the point of a high-end restaurant completely . <p> People who think there will be wide spread automation of service industries seems to completely misunderstood the value proposition of most service industries is inextricably tied to the fact a person is serving you . China-Bob 's discussion of what 's valuable about getting a haircut -- the conversation with the hairdresser -- gets much closer to the mark ( and if he was wrong , no one charging more than $10 for a haircut would have any customers , and there 'd only be one hairdresser per shopping mall ) <p> Chefs -- I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the whole purpose of professional cooking is to repeatedly create the same dish to the same recipe and standards . Of course top chef'ing will still exist as someone needs to create and continually enhance the recipes . <p> Leaving that aside , I 'd agree that a fair number of people will still want food cooked by a human and this will be a constant drag on the uptake of automation . But apart from that cooking is an ideal use case for robotics . <p> As I tried to express , I do n't think obtaining a cooked meal has anything to do with the reason(s) people pay through the nose to go to somewhere like El Buli , the Fat Duck or Vue de Monde . <p> If they invent a cooking robot , someone like Heston will re-engineer it , hire someone to push it out to each diner 's table , and turn it 's food prep process into a piece of avante garde theatre complete with soundtrack , smoke machine and laser light show , without any change to the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest overhead for a hairdresser is the rent Take away the customers , ( this 10 dollar shop is crowding them in ) and the joint goes out of business . Now so as we havent wasted a conversation , why not have a $5. machine at the barista shop . the ticket machine takes the money off the workers and correctly allocates priority . It has heaps of applications . Just sayin <p> What do you need a machine for ? Most coffee shops in my area already use an app called ' Queue Jumper ' or something like that . enabling punters to put their coffee orders in via smart phone when they start walking toward the coffee shop , so the coffee is waiting when they get there . <p> Universities should focus on research more and less on teaching . In addition , the government should make knowledge and learning opportunities freely available to all . Life long learning is a right ! Even though in the end , we will not be able to learn as rapidly as machines in some areas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Machines will become more human , and humans will become more machine . Exciting times ! <p> Will it be like Star Wars ? Droids doing the jobs whilst we get to sit in dimly lit Cantinas doing dodgy deals on turning Yoda 's swamp into high-rise apartments . To be honest not many jobs ca n't be automated , and that reduces the need for further workers to service those no longer required . Makes you wonder who going to pay for all this ? <p> On a recent trip I visited a Rehab-Hospital in Sydney , from my observations 90% of the patients were aged over 80 , they had suffered strokes , fractures , hip replacements and some were just there to get back into shape so that they were strong enough to continue to live full and productive lives within their nursing home communities . I was dumbfounded by the sheer number of Nurses , Physiotherapist , Social workers , Cleaners , Cooks and Patient-handlers , employed within these modern day refurb factories . Truth is these private for profit rehab hospitals get paid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinda cost-plus business model . Health-care is one of the few areas where real growth is occurring and where it will continue to occur . Unfortunately efficiency from automation would not be welcomed because as every cost-plus business operator knows , with this model Profit is proportional to revenue which is a direct function of Cost . If underlying costs go up so do profits . I think you need to understand why robots will displace workers within these modern day Aussie growth industries , without a good explanation this health care monster will continue to grow and continue to employee ever more people , robotics wont change the equation and AI wont fix a thing . <p> I know this is not directly related to the immigration argument , but I take issue with Mr Salt 's comment : <p> "" KPMG 's Bernard Salt has also estimated that up to half of Australian jobs could be at risk from digitisation , and warned that that technological change could mean there will too few jobs to go around in the future . "" <p> This is ridiculously short-sighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ input , but this has n't resulted in fewer overall jobs . Yes , less people are required for the same output , but at the same time we have always conceived new services and/or products to increase standard of living . To assume that the current offering will remain static and we 'll just automate ourselves to unemployment is incredibly short-sighted and shows no understanding of history . It 's just a shift of labor into a different area , not necessarily an overall increase in unemployment . <p> Good question ! How long is the average time for a 457 to become a permanent resident ( examining only those that actually applied to become permanent residents over the last say 10 years , but excluding those who are not eligible yet or have not completed the process ) ? for those that become <p> wrt the question "" why does Australia need these workers ? "" Truth is it does n't . However within any real world community the worth of any individual is not determined by their Needs but rather by the fulfillment of their Obligations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Needs and too little on it 's Obligations . Personally I want Australia to remain a respected member of the international community so I want to be a part of an Australia that achieves the grade "" exceeds expectations "" as opposed to the current grade of "" whinny needy brat that likes to sink boats "" . <p> You have conveniently conflated immigration with refugees , when the truth is our refugee intake is a tiny proportion of our total immigration intake . <p> If you are so concerned about remaining "" a respected member of the international community "" , then the logical thing to do is go easier on refugees while clamping down on the huge numbers of economic migrants arriving here by plane . <p> Personally I see our global obligations as extending way beyond the Refugee issue , one could even see our obligation as providing a Utopian pathway . For those willing to do hard work we have an Australia that is willing to provide the employment , for those wanting to reward themselves for a life of hard work ( or blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're gradually adjusting to take on our fair share of the global population load and that is the underlying Obligation which we 're fulfilling . Personally I see upping our refugee intake as a really dumb way to fulfill this population sharing requirement , Australia get nothing from the deal ( the last thing Bankstown needs is more ..... ) , it 's a much better idea to allow immigration by rich Chinese . Let them buy Chatswood outright , let them introduce real reforms to our sad schooling system ... For me this is a win -- win situation and all we need to do to profit is build F-ing housing ... honestly how difficult can that be ? <p> Good comment China-Bob . The main obligation of our elected politicians is to represent the interests of Australian citizens . If this involves more or less boatpeople , or more or less planeplane then so be it . However the ruling elite are instead prioritising strutting around on the world stage with their foreign counterparts like a bunch of peacocks trying to impress each other . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champions of radical globalisation , neoliberalism and corporate fascism . <p> I 'm sure that many of our low-skilled jobs will indeed be taken over by machines in the next 20 years or so . But just as there were no java programmers or web-designers in the first half of the 20th century , surely we will see entirely new types of jobs emerge in the AI age ? You can imagine the fields of computer vision , human/machine interfaces and even AI "" psychology "" might become vastly profitable . <p> The day that we start getting robots to do the menial work ( including building houses ! ) , is possibly the day that we start to overcome the shortsightedness and selfishness that has driven our world for so long . <p> Python is about as easy to learn as any programming language , but I still do n't think that many displaced truck drivers are going to re-skill and start a new career training Deep Learning systems with Theano for improved computer vision . More likely , if/ when this supposed AI revolution comes , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newly created jobs , whatever they turn out to be . <p> Exactly . This argument that "" only 10% to 20% of us will actually work as robots take over "" has been made since the beginning of industrialisation . Yet 60% of the population has always worked because we just kept inventing new jobs . This time it 's different ? The arrogance of contemporaries ... <p> How great would it be if you could just "" CAD up "" entire suburbs and let robots build them out of some recyclable 3D printing material ? You could probably build a house for everyone that wants one in relatively short order . Perhaps that 's a bit optimistic even for the 21st century though ? ? <p> YEars ago i used to have all the blue line drawings for say an oil refinery , say a suitcase full then with the introduction of cad , the whole project , drawings take offs method statements costings , planning etc on a CD Now the whole lot is on a USB thumb drive and the mechanical part is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Knowing the fu*kers ' propensity to cutting corners and lowering costs -- you 'll then have a disaster on your hands when it will be discovered they used everything from dioxine contaminated materials , to asbestos , to f-in yellowcake ... <p> What technology *can* achieve is very different from what technology *will* achieve . Just look at software as an example . A lot of what we 've managed to accomplish was thanks to unpaid work by talented individuals who had some freedom with regards to specifications , regulation and so on . You could not repeat the last 30 years if you started from today with today 's laws . Every binary in the /bin or /usr/bin folder would be a licensing deal . The OS filesystem structure and api description would be held up in 10 years of litigation . <p> The West has a headstart in these areas but that margin is quickly cut down wherever you encounter someone who does n't play by ' the rules ' . If you wanted to legitimately learn programming or computer aided anything ( in the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to the meat of the matter until you 're 18 . <p> Someone in a country where the rules are n't followed could start at any age . By 18 they 'd have probably already had part time jobs in the field . <p> So I do n't know how AI will go . I 'd expect that any profitable software will find itself constantly under attack by legislators , unions and IP holders . Robots wo n't buy newspapers , so I 'd also expect journalists to take easy shots at any automated fuckups ( e.g. self driving cars crashing ) . <p> How great would it be if you could just "" CAD up "" entire suburbs and let robots build them out of some recyclable 3D printing material ? You could probably build a house for everyone that wants one in relatively short order . <p> It is not possible to build extra dwellings upon a block of land WITHOUT PERMISSION FROM GOVERNMENT . That is where the shortage lies . <p> This is a little of track , but I 'm used to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place has fatigue cracking in the structures , ( also all the other theme parks ) , and there wont be cad drawings of that structure so a stress analysis can be carried.out ( you cant just start welding in reinforcing , today , ) so by the time the whole joint has been NDT 'd and the as-builts produced in cad , including the foundations , that joint is shut . that 'll take months . Then they will probably look at the electrics from the wall outlets to the substation , and the instrumentation . do nt hold your breath . How many theme parks are there ? ? <p> People tend to think about the future of automation with lots of Bender clones running around . There will definitely be auto machines replacing trivial jobs , however another manifestation of technology will be virtual workers -- tele workers . In this case someone will put on their 3D goggles , connect to the internet and inhabit a robot or become part of a factory . You could even have several people allocated to one robot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , the whole thing could be presented to them like a fantasy game . The factory could be underground or low earth orbit , but they see themselves in the garden of eden . <p> Thinking along those lines , what companies would have immense power and influence ? Well , Google , MS , Apple , Facebook will probably effectively own the future . The new virtual worlds we will inhabit could very well surpass the Kingdoms of Dirt we have lived in for millenia . There are quite likely many people who would find this prospect incomprehensible -- which may be an indication of how different the future will be . In maybe 20 years time there might be a Virtual World -- Arcadia -- that has 50 million inhabitants , its own economy , laws , its own geography , and exists purely as data in computer networks . The people in this virtual world could be anywhere on earth , but their interests are in common with other Arcadians . Who would they see as more important ? Google networks or a political party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require upkeep and investment . Serious investment . So they 'd need to be able to make a profit somehow . As long as politicians control violence , people will be interested in who controls that violence and who the violence is directed at . <p> In the late 90s I thought that our anonymous text based chat world would result in a future which was more borderless . Less prejudice , less racism , sexism or any other ' ism ' which relied on humans processing information about each other based on contextual information such as skin colour or name . <p> Instead what we got was a future where the dominant internet communication platform forces everyone to use their real name and expects them to not only put real photos of themselves up , but also photos of their friends . We are now capable of not just judging on name , race and gender , we can judge a person 's network of friends . We have multiple governments fighting over control of the internet leading to an ' island ' effect and as an added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ads to people also means that island effect may never go away . <p> I am not sure that it is SciFi . Virtual worlds have been around for at least 10 years . VR goggles are popping up all over the place -- in fact some of the latest high end ARM chips are targeted at single pcb designs that fit in the front of VR goggles -- like a special purpose smart phone built into the headset -- so look for these in supermarkets at under $100 in a few years . <p> As for the cost of maintaining Virtual Worlds , part of the premise of this post ( any many others about automation ) is that people wo n't have a job . Last centuries ideas about money and cost just do n't make sense anymore . That is more revolutionary than the robots themselves -- the inescapable fact that it will be harder and harder to measure and assign value in any meaningful way . Nobody can get their head around that one . <p> Self check out is not automation ! All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check out : 1 . The human scans the item . 2 . The human weighs the item and look up the item . 3 . The human bags the item . 4 . The human processes the payment . The only difference is the role of the cashier is now performed by the customer . That is not automation ! Also now you just have the customer scan really slowly , struggling with opening the plastic bags , requesting help when the self checkout runs into issues , and selecting the wrong item for weighing ... In fact the amount of human effort actually increased , but since the manual work of customers is free from the POV of the supermarkets , it 's not an issue ... Unless customers select the wrong item by "" mistake "" . <p> Real automation where there are zero human interaction is required . If we ca n't already automate it now , then i do n't see how automation is possible until real general AI is developed . That will be one or two decade away . <p> Ask yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by machines , with 0% human intervention over the Next decade ? <p> You have n't taken into account that the so-called automated checkouts need a human babysitter to fix problems that arise , and the duopoly are now demanding extra police to reduce theft rates . When you add in the poor ergonomics compared to the work stations of check-out workers means actually bagging is more difficult , you 've got a system that inreases rather than reduces the quantitiy of human effort required to complete a task . <p> Seriously , if that 's an example of the best that AI has to offer , everyone 's jobs are safe for another 100 years . <p> There is much more in modern society that could be automated . Take the example of a human watching an enjoyable movie on TV . Their enjoyment is interupted by an advertisement for a black sugary drink that rots teeth . This ad was carefully crafted by a ruthless marketing elite , and influences the human to drink the black sugar at a later date , stead of water . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) Get a robot to splice the film and remove the ad from the show . The human gets more enjoyment watching , and time is saved . 2 ) Get a robot to deliver a bottle of the drink to the human with a letter explaining how AI has determined what he would have bought had he watched the ad ( which now does not exist ) . 3 ) The ruthless marketing elite is taken out back by another robot and employed in another field better suited to his talents . <p> I think the movie Her has a pretty good take on what the future will look like for most ( i.e. menial , meaningless service jobs -- bullshit jobs on a large scale ) . <p> As someone above pointed out -- immigrants needs houses , they will take out loans , they will buy cars , drive on toll roads , buy food and clothes , create another taxable ( private tax-farmable ) living being . <p> IT 's all we have . <p> It 's the price we are paying now for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are paying for lower taxes . Did you not think all of that private money buying infrastructure from the State has conditions attached to the purchase , i.e. maintain policy to increase population growth , and we will send our lobby groups around to remind you of that if you behave otherwise . <p> This country will culturally be 50% Chinese and Indian ethnic origin by the turn of the new Century . <p> As much as people employ people to perform useful tasks , they employ other people to feel important -- 70-80 years after mass production of the flush toilet began , rich people still employed chamber maids to manually empty their chamber pots -- they only stopped when urbanisation , industrialisation and the increased demand for secretairal labour meant that there was simply no one prepared to be a chamber maid any more . <p> The availability of an automaton of some form to perform a task may be a necessary condition for that task to be no longer to be performed by a human , but it is far from sufficient ."

Consequently , manufacturers need to be agile in adapting their systems and processes , remain lean and use digital enablers in a digital transformation to remain relevant and competitive . <p> Loughran pointed out that agile and adaptable manufacturing was enabled by smart , connected machines and lines , that connected plants provided safer and more secure machine connectivity and that a connected and skilled workforce was faster and more innovative . <p> Reisch explained that the world was becoming increasingly volatile , uncertain , complex and ambiguous -- a confluence of driving factors which he combined into an acronym dubbed the "" Vuca "" world . <p> Advertisement <p> Advances in technology have democratised data and empower consumers to create entirely new industries , with the next wave of technological advances being driven by the Internet of Things , virtual reality , artificial intelligence and robotics . <p> Increased globalisation continues to lead to the creation of new competitors , reordering of supply chains and lowering of price points . Reisch added that the next wave of globalisation would serve to increase complexity and deepen the need for flexible business models . <p> Changing demographics also adds to complexity . Reisch noted that , in decades ahead , relatively high birth rates would make Africa and India engines of economic opportunity , while ageing populations elsewhere would transform all aspects of society , from healthcare to real estate . <p> "" Millennial-dominated workforces will reinvent the workplace , which is already occurring as companies find ways to work from home during the lockdown . "" <p> Resource scarcity is another driver to consider , as climate change and sustainability continue to define the agendas of governments and organisations globally . Social responsibility also emerged as a key differentiator for how innovative organisations operate and create value , he added . <p> Loughran noted that manufacturers that had started on their digital transformation journey , having adopted the Vuca worldview , were in a much better position to adapt to the challenges of technology advancements , increased globalisation , changing demographics and resources scarcity -- especially as these factors were amplified by the Covid-19 pandemic . <p> Reisch said that the challenges of a Vuca world were pushing manufacturers to become more project-driven , as opposed to product-driven , to remain competitive . <p> "" A mindset change is key . The human factor in the company must be on board with and support the change of becoming a project-driven company , "" he emphasised . <p> Reisch cited a company that shifted from manufacturing underwear to manufacturing cloth masks for the Covid-19 pandemic and a company that manufactured automotive parts before shifting to manufacturing respirators to support the demand arising from the crisis , as examples . <p> Loughran said that it was a common misconception that manufacturers had to fully upgrade their machinery and facilities to become digitalised and , thereby , become more lean and agile . <p> He declared that there was absolutely no doubt that manufacturers could enjoy the benefits of digitalisation with the machinery , the plant and the people already in place . <p> Such transformation was not a function of "" rip and replace "" , but rather depended on how one scales and extends existing assets , people , processes and technology , he added . <p> Agile manufacturing is defined by seamless operation , and characterised by self-configuring machines , predictive operation with self-correction and digital capabilities . These characteristics can be achieved incrementally with every successive upgrade to existing resources . <p> Traditionally , the development of the manufacturing process followed on sequentially from product development . However , Loughran and Reisch advocated for the integration of product development and manufacturing process development to enhance agility , leanness and , thereby , competitiveness . <p> To ensure that any of this is possible , Loughran concluded that it was important to ensure that the workforce was adequately connected , enabled and motivated . This includes securing remote connectivity , the capturing of skills sets and encouraging innovation ."

"<p> Intento Design is a growing French startup that is building its growth on a disruptive innovation developed by its founder , Dr Ramy Iskander . Based on 25 years of academic research and a portfolio of four patents , Intento Design raised a total of ? ? ? 2.61m from public and private investors in 2015 and 2017 to develop its software solution ID-Xplore v2.0 ( TRL8-TRL9 ) for the automated design and porting of analog blocks . Intento Design aims to extend its offer to design complete analog systems and to facilitate system integration , all using human-inspired cognitive computers . <p> Though an increasingly large part of our everyday experiences start in digital world , each of these experiences actually happen in an extraordinarily continuous and physical analog world . Maintaining the digital world ( software , apps , data , operating systems , microprocessors , memories , and so on ) and the analog world ( electronic circuits and devices , micro-mechanical systems , sensors , optical devices , etc. ) with the same pace of evolution becomes more critical than ever and directly influences individuals , industries , economies and societies all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has experienced a full evolution due to the market introduction of mature software digital design tools . This transformation did not occur in the analog world , however , and analog designers are still using simulation tools for design purposes that are some 40 years old . If such a transformation occurs , the impact on everyone will be substantial . <h> Today , analog design is impacted by : <p> The worldwide explosion of the portion of the population who use smartphones , tablets , smart surfaces , and so on ; <p> Mobility data-driven activities ; <p> The rapid evolution of all industrial sectors like aerospace , defense , medical , transport , etc. ; <p> The rapid evolution of linked sectors such as wireless communications ; and <p> The rapid emergence of novel artificial intelligence paradigms for the Internet of Things ( IoT ) . <p> Furthermore , designing analog devices and components ? ? ? is an art as much as a science ? ? ? ( McKinsey 2011 ) , as it takes 5-10 years to train competitive analog designers , something which is considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector . All these facts push and oblige Analog Design Industry ( ADI ) actors , such as design houses , integrated device manufacturers ( IDMs ) , analogue IP providers , foundries , system integrators , and SoC ( System on Chip ) fabless , to : <p> Design and migrate faster with new technologies without losing market competitiveness : Because of rapid product renewal cycles , the design of analog systems is becoming more complex due to the emergence of advanced devices such as FinFET and FDSOI used in integrated systems suitable for Internet of Everything ( IOE ) and the IOT . The increase in the complexity and density of such devices adds more design challenges for designers and today ? ? ? s design tools , which require considerable costs and efforts to be adapted for these new devices . <p> Produce error-free and correct-by-construction analog designs : While the design of digital systems needs few design iterations , due to a good level of maturity of design tools , analog systems need much more design iterations . The analog design industry ( ADI ) acknowledges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the additional costs coming originally from design errors . Using commercially available design tools , ADI actors do not have the capacities to alleviate actual design costs and consequently increase their profit margins . <p> Designing complex analog systems with no errors is a major challenge and a technological bottleneck for all actors in the field of semiconductor . To meet this market needs , Intento Design proposes three disruptive innovations : <h> ID-Xplore ? ? ? <p> This is a disruptive software which allows the systematic and automatic identification of all types of design errors arising from under-specification or over-specification and to prevent their propagation from design steps to realisation steps , hence avoiding design costs coming from deficient masks ( errors costs $5m ( ? ? ? 4.32m ) per mask for FinFET , and $1m per mask for standard processes ) . In addition , it guarantees the error-free and correct-by-construction functional designs of analog blocks . <p> ID-Xplore does not change designers ? ? ? habits or the industrial design processes that were commercially implemented several years ago . It is conceived , rather , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and simulation environments such as Cadence Design Systems ( 80% market share ) . Moreover , ID-Xplore captures the designer ? ? ? s knowledge for using it upfront in the design cycle so as to guide the designer in finding out the most appropriate design . <p> ID-Xplore is commercialised by Intento Design ( version v2.0 , released in January 2018 ) . It covers customers ? ? ? needs related to the design phase of the analog blocks level . In accordance with Intento Design ? ? ? s defined strategy , ID-Xplore is intended to completely automate system design , simulation , and integration . <p> Intento Design works in a strong partnership with STMicroelectronics to customise its software to design using ST FDSOI 28nm and migrate in GF FDSOI nodes . <p> ID-Xplore is the answer to semiconductors companies designing analog and mixed signal systems that are becoming increasingly critical . Consequently , ID-Xplore addresses a huge market opportunity to drive businesses in delivering chips on time , at a minimal cost , and to fully benefit from the latest semiconductor technologies available . Consequently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ID-Xplore means that there is great potential ( in the mid-term ) to impact European and global industrial sectors such as aerospace , defence , medical , transport , telecommunications , consumer electronics , and many others . <h> ID-Substrate ? ? ? <p> This disruptive software is a direct exploitation of the foreground results of the AUTOMICS project , which has been co-ordinated by Iskander for the last five years ( starting in July 2012 ) . This patented technology allows for the modelling of the lateral propagation of minority and majority carriers inside a piece of doped substrate . This model is automatically extracted for a complete chip and simulated in a spice format in a just a few minutes . The extracted netlist is an interconnection of three types of parasitic components : <p> Intento Diode ; <p> Intento Resistor ; and <p> Intento Homojunction . <p> These models have been designed by the Intento Design team to extensively analyse Smart Power integrated circuits ( ICs ) , particularly in electrical vehicles ( e.g. 300 sensors ) for the automotive market . The software predicts complex substrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependence , and so on . Once predicted by spice simulation , the designer can immune the smart power IC against these effects , then re-extract and re-simulate again to check that the phenomenon has disappeared . <p> The traditional approach to immune Smart Power ICs was to design and fabricate several versions and then measure these effects . This approach is very costly due to mask fabrication . With ID-Substrate , the chip fabrication is replaced by standard simulation . This results in much cheaper , reliable , durable and robust chips . <p> ID-Substrate will have a positive impact on the European competitiveness of the automotive market which is worth more than ? ? ? 750bn per year . <p> Intento Design has signed a corporate agreement with ams AG , a major designer and manufacturer of sensor solutions , to develop and deploy its software to the market by the first quarter of 2019 . <h> Cognitive and Autonomous Perceptrons ? ? ? : <p> Recently , Intento Design ? ? ? s R&amp;D team ( led by Iskander ) succeeded in developing the first Perceptron model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead of training the Perceptron on raw data sets originating from a circuit simulation or other sources of data , the new type of Perceptron uses graph theory to formally model the circuit knowledge domain , replacing training with raw data . <p> Intento Design describes the new perceptron as ? ? ? cognitive and autonomous ? ? ? . It is cognitive as it integrates the human knowledge of the circuit as a graph , and it is autonomous since it is capable of quickly solving a problem related to the circuit knowledge described by the graph . Fig. 1 illustrates the approach adopted by the Intento R&amp;D team to construct the new type of perceptron for a given circuit . <p> The Intento R&amp;D team have evidenced the high capacity and resolution speed achieved by the new perceptron in solving complex circuit problems as perceived by a human being ."
"<h> The document lays down 38 specific action points for the next two years and 12 measurable outcomes <p> Vishnu Nair <p> The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) recently announced its vision document for Payment and Settlement Systems ( Vision 2021 ) . The document , detailing RBI 's outlook for the payments space , could not have come at a better time . Payments as a vertical within the Fintech sector is looking to hit escape velocity in India . The Payments regulator 's positioning as an enabler and not as a speed-bump is a positive and sends the right signals . <p> Vision 2021 lays down 36 specific action points to be adopted during 2019-2021 to improve all aspects of payment systems . The multi-pronged approach looks at achieving 12 measurable outcomes by 2021 . These include an almost four-fold increase in digital transactions , 35 per cent increase in debit card transactions , 50 per cent increase in mobile based transactions , 100 bps ( basis points ) reduction in cost-to-customer , enhanced competition and many more payment system operators . The action points are forward-looking and quite interesting . Innovation in feature phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , geo-tagging of payment system touch points , enhancing contactless and tokenisation technology , national settlement services for card schemes and increasing adoption of distributed ledger technologies are among the items on RBI 's wish-list. <h> related news <p> The ambitious document gives us a sneak-peek into what RBI has in store from a regulations point of view in the coming years . These could change the way payment industry participants conduct their business . Some expected regulations are touched upon below . <p> Regulation of gateway services providers and aggregators . This is not a new suggestion . There is , however , a sense of certainty that we may now expect regulation governing payment gateway service operators and aggregators . RBI had previously imposed rules on online payment gateway service providers from an import payment perspective . It had also exercised some control over aggregators as intermediaries for determining how the latter utilised the funds passing through their accounts . However , we predict something more comprehensive from the RBI . At this stage , it is difficult to guess whether RBI is looking at a formal authorisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment system operators . Considering that gateways and aggregators are typically not engaged in clearing or settlement functions , a guidelines-based approach is more likely . The intention would be to ensure that these entities do not misuse their enhanced role in digital payment transactions . <p> Friction-free inbound remittances . With a view to reducing the cost of cross-border remittances , the RBI has promised to examine the role that payment services providers can play to ensure friction-free cross-border remittances at lower cost . The proposed Fintech Regulatory Sandbox would be a good platform to beta-test the functionality that non-bank payment players can provide here . This assumes importance in the context that cross-border remittances ( inward and outward ) have traditionally been strictly regulated . <p> Self-regulatory organisation ( SRO ) . This is an interesting proposal . RBI emphasises the need for a self-regulatory governance framework . An SRO would be instrumental for framing best practices . It would also serve as a communication channel between industry players and the regulator . This practice is not new for the RBI , however . It had earlier appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NBFC-MFI industry . It needs to be seen if an industry body such as the Payments Council of India would be given this responsibility . <p> Regulatory sandboxes . RBI recognises the need for using regulatory sandboxes to enable innovation while mitigating systemic risk . RBI 's decision to move forward is apparent from the draft ' Enabling Framework for Regulatory Sandbox ' that was released for comments in April this year . While the draft framework is restrained in my view , it is a start . Hopefully , the RBI will take stakeholder comments into account before finalising the framework . A regulatory sandbox would , apart from fostering innovation , give participants the chance to understand RBI 's thoughts on gaps that need to be filled in the ecosystem . Catering to those requirements would result in a more uniform pattern of growth and innovation in the space . <p> E-mandates / standing instructions . RBI is considering implementing e-mandates/ standing instructions for retail payment systems . The process has already begun with the RBI having recently given the National Payments Corporation of India approval for implementing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go a long way in simplifying customer experience during retail payment transactions . <p> Security aspects of mobile payments . RBI is looking to update its mobile banking guidelines with specific standards , minimum requirements , best practices and risk mitigation measures . The updated guidelines should look into the possibility of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence , internet of things and wearable device technology being utilised for payment services . <p> Framework for testing resilience of payment systems . Vision 2021 proposes a framework for testing the ability of payment systems to operate even if a system has failed completely . This is an extremely important step . If RBI 's intent is to aggressively push for digital payments and a cash-less economy , there is a corresponding responsibility to ensure business continuity and adequate disaster response mechanisms in case of infrastructure redundancy or other unplanned system down-time . <p> A promising future <p> The next three years promise interesting developments in this space , given RBI 's intent of empowering an exceptional e-payment experience . Vision 2021 is important in terms of laying down expectations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various Ministries and Government Departments that will invariably be involved in some manner of policy making or implementation . It is notable that RBI has recognised inter-regulator ( SEBI , IRDA , TRAI , etc. ) and inter-department coordination as action points for implementation . <p> Vision 2021 also assumes significance , considering the recommendations of the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Finalisation of Amendments to the Payments and Settlements System Act ( PSSA ) . The Committee had , in August 2018 , recommended creation of an independent regulator for payment systems . RBI issued a dissent note strongly opposing any such move . While PSSA amendments are yet to be finalised and no decision has been taken on a separate regulator , any dilution in RBI 's powers as a regulator may have a bearing on the proposals and action points under Vision 2021 . <p> That said , the action plans being put in place and the expected 2021 outcomes are commendable . While they do look optimistic targets , they are by no means unrealistic . Going by the accelerated growth we are witnessing in the payments industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected ."

An overview of the significant progress achieved over the last 10 years is presented here , together with the original context of and motivations for this research . After a general introduction , we first summarize the fundamental properties of spasers and discuss the major motivations that led to the first demonstrations of spasers and nanolasers . This is followed by an overview of crucial technological progress , including lasing threshold reduction , dynamic modulation , room-temperature operation , electrical injection , the control and improvement of spasers , the array operation of spasers , and selected applications of single-particle spasers . Research prospects are presented in relation to several directions of development , including further miniaturization , the relationship with Bose -- Einstein condensation , novel spaser-based interconnects , and other features of spasers and plasmonic lasers that have yet to be realized or challenges that are still to be overcome . <h> Introduction <p> Among the discoveries and inventions that have defined science , technology and , generally , civilization as we know it , the invention of the laser 60 years ago stands out1,2,3 . Lasers provide the unique capability to concentrate energy in the form of coherent radiation in the smallest phase-space volume possible in optics . This allows the formation of coherent beams with a minimum angular divergence or the focusing of radiation to the smallest possible spots , with sizes down to a half-wavelength . Lasers also allow the concentration of optical energy in the time domain to the shortest possible pulses , with a duration on the order of a single optical cycle , providing access to sub-cycle phenomena with durations on the order of 100 attoseconds4,5 . <p> Historically , lasers were heralded for their monochromaticity , high intensity , and low beam divergence ; however , today , stimulated emission is utilized as a tool that offers exquisite control to engineer light fields with well-defined frequencies , statistical properties , polarizations , and spatial profiles . The range of applications is vast . Miniaturization has always been a persistent topic of research in photonics ; just 2 years after Maiman 's first laser3 , semiconductor lasers6 emerged , which were orders of magnitude smaller . Technologically , semiconductor lasers are naturally more compact , but with the advent of heterostructures7 , they also became able to operate at lower power under electrical injection , even under battery power . As transistor scaling and integration set in motion the microelectronics and computer revolutions , the integration of microelectronics with photonics was long perceived to be unavoidable8 . When the smallest dimensions of lasers eventually reached wavelength scales in the 1990s ( see , e.g. , ref. 9 ) , they were still several orders of magnitude larger than transistors . However , it was realized that micro- and nanoscale optical resonators could be utilized to control spontaneous emission . From this paradigm , spontaneous emission control emerged as a modern topic of research in the field of nanolasers . <p> By the turn of the millennium , optically pumped photonic crystal ( PC ) nanolasers were among the smallest devices10 . Other forms of small lasers soon followed starting in the early 2000s11 , such as nanowire lasers12,13,14,15,16 . However , the quest to reduce the resonator size made it extremely difficult to produce such small PC lasers operating under electrical injection . Metal contacts that closely approached the cavity inevitably introduced both scattering and absorption losses . Complications of poor heat conduction and low mechanical stability also arose as these devices were constructed from thin suspended membranes of semiconductor material . Meanwhile , many studies on metallic waveguides were indicating the possibility of confinement beyond the wavelength range of **25;858;TOOLONG . As such approaches introduced metallic loss , integrated gain strategies were also devised to prolong the propagation of light24,25,26 . The final ingredient , and the key to effectively scaling down the physical size of lasers , was the emergence of metal-based cavities operating in dielectric modes27 or plasmonic modes in 200728 . Such devices embraced the capability of metals to provide all of the requirements for any laser29,30,31,32 : optical confinement , feedback , electrical contacts , and thermal management33,34,35,36 . Such approaches relied on metals to support surface electromagnetic waves that used electron oscillations to promote optical confinement . It was Bergman and Stockman33 who first realized in 2003 that these surface plasmon waves could also be amplified by stimulated emission . Thus , the concept of the spaser ( an acronym for surface plasmon amplification by stimulated emission of radiation ) was born . This realization provoked considerable interest due to the predicted ability of such a new device to generate coherent plasmonic fields , along with the prospective applications of this capability . <p> Ten years ago , three teams34,35,36 independently demonstrated the first plasmonic nanolasers , or spasers , from different perspectives and with different motivations ( Fig. 1 ) . These plasmonic nanolasers are extremely compact coherent light sources with ultrafast dynamics and a broad palette of promising applications8,37 . The original spaser design was a nanoshell-based localized surface plasmon ( LSP ) spaser36 containing a metal nanosphere as the plasmonic core , surrounded by a dielectric shell containing a gain material , typically dye molecules . Since then , other nanoshell LSP spasers have been reported38,39 . Such spasers are the smallest coherent generators produced so far , with sizes on the order of several to tens of nanometers . On the other hand , devices that were originally termed plasmonic nanolasers34,35 are based on semiconductor-metal plasmonic gap modes with a surface plasmon polariton ( SPP ) mode propagating in one of the dimensions . In terms of the physics principles at work , these SPP nanolasers34,35 are the same as spasers36 , with the only difference being whether localized36 or propagating plasmon modes34,35 are involved . Therefore , we will not intentionally distinguish in this paper between SPP nanolasers and LSP spasers , and we use the two terms interchangeably . Later , this type of nanolaser ( or SPP spaser ) was widely developed and **26;885;TOOLONG . There are also LSP nanospasers that are similar in design to SPP nanolasers but are true nanospasers whose dimensions are all on the nanoscale . Such a spaser consists of a semiconductor nanorod as a gain material deposited on top of a single-crystal nanofilm of a plasmonic metal46 . These spasers possess very low thresholds and have been demonstrated for wavelengths spanning the visible spectrum by changing the semiconductor composition while keeping the geometry fixed47,48,49 . A similar SPP spaser has also been demonstrated with quantum-dot gain media50 . The great progress achieved over the last decade has led to rapid evolution from the very preliminary proof-of-concept demonstrations to a great variety of plasmonic nanolaser **45;913;TOOLONG ... ( Fig. 2 ) , including more realistic devices aimed at specific applications . For example , their intrinsic capabilities suggest their potential for application in optical **38;960;TOOLONG , near-field spectroscopy and sensing42,44,53,71,72 , optical probing for biological systems38,73 , and far-field beam synthesis through near-field eigenmode **31;1000;TOOLONG . Although critical design problems still challenge the research community , there are also unprecedented opportunities for new advances in enhancing gain8,80 and plasmonic materials , artificial intelligence ( AI ) -driven optimal designs81 , and fabrication protocols80 that would enable new , extremely compact devices with ultrafast operation speeds . <p> Fig. 1 : The first reported plasmonic nanolasers , or spasers , in 2009 . <p> a Nanolaser based on a **45;1033;TOOLONG plasmonic gap mode , where vertical confinement was achieved by means of a double heterostructure34. b Plasmonic nanolaser based on a two-dimensionally confined nanowire plasmonic mode35. c Spaser based on a three-dimensionally confined metal nanoparticle mode36 . <p> This review article provides a historical overview of spaser and plasmonic nanolaser research over the past decade . We aim to place recent breakthroughs into the context of the original historical motivations for laser miniaturization . This review article does not attempt to focus on the applications of nanolasers , which have recently been covered elsewhere8,37 . Rather , it is a commentary on how we can exploit the control that laser miniaturization offers . The purpose of this review is thus to identify potential future research directions that build on our current perspective . For example , nanolasers naturally offer the highest available degree of control over both spontaneous and stimulated emission processes . Some interesting questions arise : If we are able to effectively control spontaneous emission into a single mode , would such an LED be sufficient without driving above the threshold into lasing ? How small can a nanolaser be ? Are the smallest nanolasers necessary , or is there an optimal length scale to ensure that other attributes meet essential application requirements , such as the energy efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio8,69 ? <h> Fundamental properties of spasers <p> A schematic of the geometry and fundamental operating principles of a spaser is presented in Fig. 3 . The gain medium depicted in Fig. 3 can be either a nanoshell consisting of a bulk semiconductor , semiconductor ( colloidal ) quantum dots ( QDs ) , or dye molecules . For concreteness , we will describe the operation of a spaser in terms of a bulk semiconductor nanoshell ; the cases of QDs and dye molecules are quite similar . <p> Fig. 3 : Conceptual schematic of a realistic spaser geometry and composition as well as its action principle82 . <p> a Schematic of the geometry and composition of a nanoshell spaser surrounded by a gain medium . The local fields ( per one plasmon in the dipolar spasing mode ) are shown with the color scale defined by the bar to the right . The plasmonic nanoshell and gain medium ( orange dots ) are indicated . b The same as a but for the gain medium inside the shell . c Schematic of spaser operation . The energy levels of the gain medium are depicted to the left , and those of the plasmonic core ( the nanoshell , in this case ) are shown to the right . An external source ( optical or electrical , indicated by a vertical black arrow ) injects electrons into the conduction band , creating a non-equilibrium ( hot ) electron-hole plasma . The hot carriers relax to the bandgap ( vertical green arrow ) , possibly forming excitons . These excitations decay radiationlessly , transferring their energy to SPs of the nanoshell ( shown by coupled red arrows ) . These SPs stimulate the emission of more SPs , causing an avalanche of generation that is eventually stabilized by the saturation of the gain medium . <p> The external source pumps electrons into the conduction band ( CB ) and holes into the valence band ( VB ) of the gain medium , creating a population inversion . These carriers relax , creating an inversion at the bandgap ( the creation of excitons appears to be unlikely due to the high required free carrier density ) . The CB ? ? ? VB transitions in the gain medium are coupled to the LSP excitation/annihilation transition ( represented in Fig. 3c by the coupled red arrows ) by near-field radiationless transitions induced by a coupling term in the Hamiltonian H ' ? = ? -dEn where d is an electronic transition dipole in the gain medium . <p> A semi-classical theory of spasers , in which the gain medium is treated quantum mechanically and the SPs are treated classically , has been presented in ref. 82 . A nanoscale spaser ( nanospaser ) has many unique and general properties due to its nature as a deeply subwavelength , quasistatic device . Note that in this case , no electromagnetic scale ( wavelength , skin depth , decay length , etc. ) is relevant , and spaser theory scales with the only important scale : the size of the metal nanosystem , which we will denote by R. Consequently , a spaser possesses a series of general properties , some of which make it uniquely different from micro- or macroscopic lasers . <p> ( i ) <p> The condition for spasing does not depend on the spaser size and is given by the following inequality83 : <p> where ne is the volume density of active electrons in the gain medium , the metal quality factor is defined as ( Q = left varepsilon mathrmm right/mathrmImvarepsilon mathrmm ) , em is the permittivity of the metal in the spaser core at the spasing frequency , G12 is the spectral width of the spasing transition , and ed is the permittivity of the surrounding dielectric medium . This condition can be recast in a very simple form83 in terms of the gain , g , that the spaser gain medium must possess in the bulk , g ? = ? gth , where the threshold gain is gth ? = ? k/Q , with ( k = omega sqrt varepsilon d /c ) being the radiation wave vector in the surrounding medium . For a good plasmonic metal of Q ? ? 10 -- 100 , this spasing condition is very realistic and easy to satisfy with semiconductor or dye-gain media . Because the spasing condition ( 1 ) does not depend on the spaser size , the spaser can be made truly nanoscopic . <p> There are several experimentally demonstrated spasers , all of them possessing a shell geometry similar to that in Fig. 3a , whose sizes are truly nanometric ( from several nanometers to several tens of nanometers ) 36,38,39 . The unique applications of these nanospasers enabled by their nanometer-scale sizes include their biomedical use as intracellular labels and theragnostic agents . Such applications include cancer diagnostics and therapeutics ( theragnostics ) 38 and super-resolution ( stimulated emission depletion , or STED ) imaging39 . <p> ( ii ) <p> The spasing frequency , ? s , is a linear average of the gain transition frequency , ? 21 , and the LSP frequency , ? p , namely , <p> where ? p is the LSP resonance width . This is identical to the frequency pulling effect in conventional lasers with detuning84 , except that the cavity frequency is replaced by the plasmon frequency . The spasing frequency does not depend on the spaser size or on the pumping rate . It is generally different from both the gain-medium transition frequency , ? 21 , and the LSP frequency , ? p . The frequency walk-off effect is inherent to both lasers and spasers , but in the latter case , it can be very significant due to the large spectral widths involved . One of the consequences of this fact is the possibility of tuning the spasing frequency throughout the entire visible range by changing the bandgap of the semiconductor gain medium while leaving the geometry and composition of the metal core unchanged47 . <p> The fact that the nanospaser frequency ( 2 ) depends only on the spaser shape and material composition but not on its size makes a nanospaser an outstanding frequency-based sensor of its dielectric environment . It is also uniquely sensitive to an extremely small amount of analyte due to its nanoscopic modal volume . <p> ( iii ) <p> For a nanospaser , the spontaneous decay rate , ? 2 , of the gain-medium excitation into the LSP spasing mode is plasmonically enhanced and can be expressed for a nanoshell spaser82 as follows : <p> where ( varepsilon mathrmmprime = mathrmRevarepsilon mathrmm ) , ( varepsilon mathrmmprimeprime = Imvarepsilon mathrmm ) , and R is the nanoshell radius . An estimate with silver as a metal in the red spectral region and realistic parameters , d ? = ? 15 D and R ? = ? 5 nm , yields ? 2 ? ? ? 5ps-182 . This rate exceeds the rates of other decay channels in the gain medium . This implies that the injection of a carrier into the CB of the gain medium leads to a spontaneous emission of an SP in the metal core , and as a result , Np ? ? ? Ip , where Np is the SP population of the spasing mode and Ip is the rate of pumping . In such a case , the rate of radiation of the spaser , Ir , as a function of the pumping rate ( the so-called L -- L curve ) is linear even for a very small Ip , far below the spasing threshold . Above the spasing threshold , the emission rate is increased by a factor of Np , and the L -- L curve is always a straight line as a function of Ip . Thus , the spasing threshold is imperceptible in the L -- L curve . Because ? 2 ? ? ? R-3 , as seen in Eq . ( 3 ) , such an "" ultralow threshold "" or "" thresholdless "" behavior always occurs for sufficiently small nanospasers . Such behavior has been demonstrated in a number of experiments ; see , e.g. , ref. 47 . <p> ( iv ) <p> Above the spasing threshold , SP emission is stimulated , and its emission rate can be estimated to increase with the pumping intensity Ip as ( gamma 2left ( mathrmst right ) mathrmsim gamma 2Nmathrmp propto Imathrmp ) . Because Np scales as ? R3 , the generated spaser relaxation rate , ( left ( gamma 2left ( mathrmst right ) right ) - 1 ) , does not depend on R and is proportional to the pumping rate . Hence , a nanospaser can be used for direct modulation with a maximum frequency of 5 THz that increases with pumping ; it can also be used to generate ultrafast pulses with a duration of &lt;100 fs ( see the theory in ref. 82 ) . Experimental evidence indicates that the direct modulation rate of a spaser can exceed 1 THz and that the pulses generated can be shorter than 0.8 ps85 . <p> ( v ) <p> The absence of a perceptible threshold in the L -- L line , Ir(Ip) or Np(Ip) , does not imply that there actually is no threshold for coherent generation , as has been discussed elsewhere86,87 . A finite threshold still exists , and it can be determined from the second-order autocorrelation function of the spaser radiation , g(2) ( t ) . This function is conventionally defined as <p> where P(t) is the probability of detecting a photon from the spaser at time t and t is the time delay between the detection of two consecutive photons . This function is normalized such that g(2) ( t ) ? ? ? 1 for t ? ? ? 8 . Such higher-order correlation functions are conventionally used to characterize the statistics of photons emitted by various sources84,88 . <p> Below the spasing threshold , the local and emitted fields of a spaser possess random statistics . In the extreme limit of Gaussian statistics , g(2) ( t ) ? ? ? 2 for t ? ? ? 0 . Generally , below the threshold , one expects 2 ? = ? g(2) ( 0 ) ? &gt; ? 1 . Immediately above the threshold , the spaser generation statistics change , and for pumping intensities at this threshold and higher , we have g(2) ( t ) ? ? ? 1 for all t . Such threshold behavior is characteristic of lasers generating emission in a single mode88 . For a nanospaser , this behavior has been convincingly demonstrated in experiments46,47 . Note that such behavior corresponds to a non-equilibrium phase transition above which the local fields around the spaser become coherent and large , in contrast to the case of spontaneous SP emission . <h> Physical motivations for small lasers <h> Background of spaser invention <p> Even with all the remarkable progress in laser technology achieved over the last 60 years , the spatial concentration of laser radiation is still limited to a half-wavelength , i.e. , a distance of 1 ? ? m , due to the wave nature of optical radiation . However , there are a large range of objects and phenomena at the nanoscale that represent a realm of significant fundamental and applied interest , as envisioned by Feynman89 . Among them , natural objects such as subcellular structures and biological macromolecules , with sizes on the order of 10 nm , and engineering structures such as transistors , with sizes even below 10 nm , stand out . Therefore , coherent sources at corresponding optical frequencies have great fundamental and applied significance . <p> Obviously , photons , which are the quanta of electromagnetic fields , can not be compressed to sizes much less than the diffraction limit , which is on the order of the wavelength , ( frac2pi comega sqrt varepsilon ) , where c is the speed of light in vacuum , ? is the optical frequency , and e is the permittivity of the medium . This size , even for highly polarizable dielectrics with e ? ? 10 , is still on the order of hundreds of nanometers , being one or more orders of magnitude greater than our target size of 10 nm . The use of plasmonic nanoparticles and pointed probes to concentrate optical energy due to plasmonic resonance enhancement and geometric concentration is a successful approach for nanoscopy , nanospectroscopy , and nanoscale detection and sensing90,91,92,93 . <p> Despite all this progress , a coherent nanoscale optical source is still highly desirable and promising . The idea of such a nanosource is that the photons in a laser are , in a sense , coincidental . The general properties that a field 's quanta must satisfy to be suitable for coherent quantum generation , which photons do satisfy , are as follows : ( i ) bosonic statistics , which are needed to coherently accumulate a significant number of such quanta in a single state ( mode ) ; ( ii ) high linearity or harmonicity , which provides the possibility of accumulating such quanta and achieving a high field amplitude without a significant nonlinear ( anharmonic ) frequency shift ( "" chirp "" ) or deterioration of the quality factor of the resonance ; and ( iii ) electroneutrality , which is necessary because otherwise , the accumulation of N quanta would cause an increase in their Coulomb energy scaling as ? N , which would be unsustainable for N ? ? ? 1 . <p> These properties are all satisfied by surface plasmons ( SPs ) -- both LSPs and SPPs92 . LSPs are fundamentally , by far , the most strongly localized optical-frequency quanta94 . The reason is that the modal field potential of an LSP , fn(r) , satisfies the quasistatic equation <p> Here , we assume that the system consists of two components -- a metal and a dielectric -- and that ? ( r ) is a characteristic function that is equal to 1 in the metal and 0 in the dielectric94 ; 1 ? &gt; ? sn ? &gt; ? 0 is an eigenvalue , and fn(r) is the corresponding eigenfunction ; and homogeneous Dirichlet -- Neumann boundary conditions hold . This equation does not possess any spatial scale except that defined by ? ( r ) , implying that the LSPs are localized at the minimum scale of the metal nanoparticles constituting the system , which is assumed to be nanometric . <p> The LSPs defined by Eq . ( 5 ) obviously satisfy the three requirements formulated above : ( i ) Their modal field is a vector , ( mathbfEnleft ( mathbfr right ) = - fracpartial partial mathbfrvarphi nleft ( mathbfr right ) ) ; consequently , they are of spin 1 and are bosons , in accordance with the Pauli theorem95. ( ii ) They are electroneutral , as follows from Eq . ( 5 ) . ( iii ) LSPs are known to be highly harmonic due to their nature as collective excitations of a large number of electrons . The same properties are true of SPPs , except that they are propagating waves and , consequently , delocalized compared to LSPs . In addition , SPs interact with charges via their modal electric fields En(r) just as photons do . Consequently , SPs can potentially be used instead of photons for quantum amplification and generation . A fundamental advantage of using SPs in lieu of photons is that they are nanoscopic by their localization scale . This idea of nanoscale spaser has been introduced in ref. 33 ; see also refs. 82,96,97,98,99 . <h> Threshold control in nanolasers <p> One of the original motivations for laser miniaturization was to reduce power consumption , which can be realized by simply reducing the physical volume of the gain material69 . In the 1990s , Purcell 's effect was extensively explored to control the spontaneous emission rate and , thereby , the spontaneous emission coupling factor ( ? ) 100,101,102 through various methods of laser size reduction . A laser 's photon production , by means of either optical or electrical pumping , is shared between the available optical modes -- the more optical modes there are , the higher the pump rate required to achieve the lasing threshold . The advantage thus comes from reducing the number of optical modes , Nm , by using small optical cavities : this simply enables a higher proportion of spontaneous emission to seed the laser modes . To a first-order approximation , under the assumption that each optical mode competes equally for emission , the fraction of spontaneous emission , ? , into a single laser mode is ( beta sim Nmathrmm - 1 ) . This concept inspired intense research aimed at creating the smallest possible lasers to achieve "" thresholdless lasers "" emitting almost no spontaneous emission103 . <p> Because the stimulated emission needs to dominate in the lasing state , the lasing threshold can sometimes be defined intuitively as the condition in which the rates of spontaneous and stimulated emission into the laser mode are equal37 . According to Einstein 's 1916 paper on spontaneous and stimulated emission coefficients , this condition is equivalent to saying that a lasing mode should contain one photon to reach the threshold104 . Hence , for a given cavity loss rate , ? , the minimum power needed to maintain a single photon in the lasing mode is ( gamma times hupsilon times frac1beta ) , where h ? is the energy of that single photon . The total threshold power should also include the power needed to pump and maintain the carriers at the upper energy level for population inversion . The minimum power needed to maintain population inversion is ? SP ? ? ? E21 ? ? ? V ? ? ? ntr , where ? SP is the spontaneous emission rate , E21 is the energy required to pump carriers into the excited energy level ( h ? ) , and V and ntr are the physical volume and transparency carrier density , respectively , of the gain material . <p> An analysis of the rate equations yields the same physical picture , from which we can obtain the following normalized threshold pump rate , Rth , for either photons or electrons37 : <p> where ? ? = ? ? /ag , with ag being the loss due to the gain material . There is a useful symmetry to this threshold definition : ( beta propto Nmathrmm - 1 ) quantifies how the pump energy is divided amongst a device 's optical modes , and ? ? ? ? ( V ? ? ? ntr ) -1 quantifies the energy overhead for achieving population inversion . Note that ? is unbounded -- for example , the operation of a laser is typically dominated by cavity loss ( ? ? ? ? 8 ) for a "" 4-level "" gain material . The threshold is minimized in cases where ? ? ? ? 1 and ? ? ? ? 8 , such that Rth ? ? ? ? . Here , the minimum pump rate is exactly the rate at which photons are being lost from the cavity mode . Under this definition , thresholdless lasing is not physically possible . <h> Accelerated laser dynamics <p> One of the important features of plasmonic lasers is their potential for ultrafast modulation . The spatial and spectral localization of nanocavity modes leads to modified dynamics due to the enhanced interactions between the gain medium and the cavity mode , i.e. , the same Purcell effect105 mentioned above . The Purcell effect changes the natural spontaneous emission lifetime , t0 , by the Purcell factor , F ? = ? t0/t , where t is the modified lifetime . The accelerated spontaneous emission into lasing modes enables nanolasers to have ultrafast responses106 . Theoretical studies and numerical simulations have shown that nanolasers can be modulated at 100s GHz or even up to **30;1080;TOOLONG . Recently , a nanolaser emitting sub-picosecond pulses has been experimentally demonstrated85 . <p> Beyond the Purcell factor , accelerated laser dynamics modify the interactions between the gain material and the available optical modes . Some optical modes may couple preferentially to the gain material , while others could be suppressed . For the nth optical mode , the corresponding modal spontaneous emission lifetime is tn . The total Purcell factor is a sum over the modal Purcell factors , ( F = tau 0tau - 1 = sum nolimitsn tau 0tau n - 1 =sum nolimitsn Fn ) . The effect on stimulated emission is two-fold : first , all light-matter interactions within the gain medium are accelerated , including stimulated emission ; second , the modal spontaneous emission factors are modified , such that for the nth mode , ? n ? = ? Fn/F . This , in turn , modifies the lasing threshold for a particular mode . An increased ? -factor further accelerates the temporal response under direct laser **43;1112;TOOLONG . Accessing high Purcell factors through high-cavity quality is not valid when the cavity resonance is narrower than the inhomogeneously broadened emission linewidth . Furthermore , it is not necessarily advantageous for laser performance . For example , long photon lifetimes limit the modulation bandwidth of a laser108 . <p> One of the related issues with short carrier lifetimes is the validity of the rate equation approximations113 . The complete set of Maxwell -- Bloch equations describing a semiconductor laser includes coupled rate equations for photons and the population as well as the medium polarization equation . Due to the typically short nature of the polarization lifetime ( sub-ps ) compared to the carrier lifetime ( 1 ns ) , only the photon and population rate equations remain , whereas the polarization equation may be adiabatically eliminated . For a plasmonic nanolaser , however , this approximation becomes questionable due to the greatly enhanced spontaneous emission rate , which could make the carrier lifetime more similar to the polarization lifetime . Therefore , the ultrafast modulation of plasmonic nanolasers , in general , can not be analyzed based on the conventional rate equations alone . The validity of the rate equations was recently studied113 together with an analysis of the modulation of plasmonic nanolasers using a more complete set of equations beyond the rate equation approximation . Although there have been extensive theoretical studies , a systematic experimental investigation of plasmonic nanolasers is still lacking , with only a limited number of papers having been published on this topic . The operation of plasmonic nanolasers under direct current modulation has not been demonstrated . Many theoretical predictions have not been experimentally validated . Other aspects of modulation related to size and energy efficiency have been discussed more extensively elsewhere69 . <h> Loss and gain in plasmonic nanolasers <p> One of the important issues for plasmonic nanolasers is to overcome the metal loss by means of optical gain . Since it is known that the typical semiconductor gain is on the order of 103 -- 104 cm-1 ( the material gain ) , whereas the absorption of a metal can be as large as 106 cm-1 , it seems to be impossible to ever overcome the metal absorption when an SPP mode is propagating at a semiconductor-metal interface , where the mode exists partially on both sides . One of the interesting features of the propagation of a surface plasmonic mode is the dramatic slowing down of the energy flux and its consequences for the optical gain experienced by the mode , the so-called modal gain . This leads to an unusual property of the modal confinement factor114 , which can be several orders of magnitude larger than unity , which is conventionally thought to be the upper limit in weakly guided situations . A fortunate coincidence is that , at the interface between a semiconductor and a metal , the confinement factor for the metallic region is approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the semiconductor region . The former defines the modal loss , whereas the latter def"

"<p> What are the chances , then , of creating a natural-language machine learning system on the order of Watson , albeit with open source components ? To some degree , this has already happened -- in part because Watson itself was built in top of existing open source work , and others have been developing similar systems in parallel to Watson . Here 's a look at four such projects . <p> The biggest name brand of the bunch , DARPA 's DeepDive project is n't meant to emulate Watson 's plain-language query system , but rather Watson 's ability to improve its decision-making over time with human guidance . <p> Developed principally by Christopher Re , a professor at the University of Wisconsin , the project is open source ( Apache 2.0 ) . According to EE Times , the main goal of DeepDive is to create an automated system for classifying unstructured data -- in one example case , categorizing articles in technical journals . Those planning to make use of DeepDive should be familiar with SQL and Python , but the system is already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources , such as Web pages or PDF documents . <p> Unstructured Information Management ( UIMA ) is a standard for performing analysis on textual content . Watson used an implementation of UIMA , but you do n't have to go through Watson to use UIMA . In fact , IBM 's UIMA architecture was open-sourced and is being maintained by the Apache Foundation . It features support for multiple programming languages , with updates added periodically ( most recently in October 2014 ) . <p> Apache UIMA as it stands is a long way from being a full machine learning solution ; it 's only one -- albeit an important -- part of the whole that IBM created . If you do n't want to use the bare bones , you can pick up one of its derivative projects , such as YodaQA , which leverages UIMA for its processing and uses Wikipedia as a primary data source . <p> OpenCog "" aims to provide research scientists and software developers with a common platform to build and share artificial intelligence programs . "" Open-sourced under the GNU Affero license , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what its creators call "" generally intelligent "" systems , artificial intelligence that has broad , humanlike understandings of the world instead of domain-centered specialties ( such as being very good at chess but nothing else ) . <p> OpenCog 's creators claim their framework is already in use in "" natural language applications , both for research and by commercial corporations . "" That puts it a little further away from pie-in-the-sky AI concepts and closer to the practical Q&amp;A domain inhabited by Watson . <p> As the name might imply , OAQA 's mission is "" open advancement in the engineering of question answering systems -- language software systems that provide direct answers to questions posed in natural language . "" Sound like one of Watson 's aims ? Yup , especially since the OAQA was jointly initiated by IBM and Carnegie Mellon University . Like Apache UIMA , OAQA implements the UIMA framework , but do n't think of it as a ready-to-use solution ; it 's a toolkit . <p> The one major drawback to each project , as you can guess , is that they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Watson . Whereas Watson is designed to be used immediately in a business context , these are raw toolkits that require heavy lifting . <p> Plus , Watson 's services have already been pre-trained with a curated body of real-world data . With these systems , you 'll have to supply the data sources , which may prove to be a far bigger project than the programming itself ."
"<h> Using text inputs , a team of machine learning experts edited videos of people to realistically form words they never said . <p> A research team consisting of machine learning experts from Stanford and Princeton Universities , as well as the Max Planck Institute for Informatics and Adobe , created a method for literally putting words in people 's mouths , using just text inputs and a source video . <p> By analyzing the speech patterns in a video of one person speaking into a camera , they 're able to swap whole phrases for completely different ones . The result is pretty realistic . <p> In the video demonstration , a woman saying "" one hundred and ninety one point four "" is made to say "" one hundred and eighty two point two "" instead . A man reciting the Apocalypse Now quote "" I love the smell of napalm in the morning , "" is made to seem like he 's saying "" I love the smell of french toast in the morning . "" <p> To do this , the researchers identify and isolate the phonemes -- tiny units of sound within speech -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face model that tracks how the face and lips move with the words . Then , they find the visemes -- sounds that look the same in how the lips move , such as "" v "" and "" f "" -- and combine parts from the face model to match the new phrases . Someone saying "" viper "" and "" -ox "" in different parts of a video can be sliced up into a face model saying the word "" fox . "" <p> If you watch closely and know what to look for ( slightly stiff mouth movements , small inconsistencies in the motion of the mouth ) you can tell where the new words are inserted . But without knowing where the edits occur , your eyes easily gloss over it . <p> In terms of fact versus reality , this might be the most startling part of this processing technique . It 's a small change , isolating the mouth and jawline and inserting only a few words within a longer sentence . In context , your eyes see what you want to see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To test how convincing their edited videos were , the researchers conducted a web-based study of 138 participants which them to view real and edited videos , and rate their response to the phrase "" this video clip looks real to me "" on a five-point scale . More than half of the participants -- around 60 percent -- rated the edited video clips as real . The unedited , "" ground truth "" videos were only rated to be "" real "" around 80 percent of the time . <p> People are already easily duped when it comes to videos that confirm what they want to believe , such as we saw with the edited video of Nancy Pelosi . But when they 're put on alert , confirmation bias swings the other direction , to total disbelief of what 's actually real . <p> In their whitepaper , the researchers on this text-swapping method commit several paragraphs to the ethical considerations of such technology . "" The availability of such technology -- at a quality that some might find indistinguishable from source material -- also raises important and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write .

The Delhi-based Airwoot uses machine learning to help brands deliver high-speed customer service on social media . <p> "" This acquisition is in line with our pursuit to bring innovative solutions to the market , "" said Girish Mathrubootham , founder , Freshdesk . <p> Backed with funding of $94 million through multiple rounds of funding , Mathrubootham 's Freshdesk has been on an acquisition spree since last August .

"<h> Tags <h> How your company can be ' Google Smart ' with machine learning <p> Google has been using machine learning to improve its business analytics for years and judging from all the recent excitement about the technology , you 'd assume enterprises everywhere would be following suit . Yet , according to some studies , only 22 percent of companies are already using machine learning 's analytical power by implementing algorithms in their data management platforms . <p> So why are n't more organisations taking advantage of the science that can make them "" Google smart "" ? Probably because they believe it 's too complicated . They might think their data is too voluminous or unreliable , might consider the required data preparation too time intensive or might assume only data scientists have the skill set needed to leverage machine learning . While those concerns may have held true a few years ago , today , all those objections can be overcome . <h> The Renaissance of Machine Learning <p> In the past , using machine learning algorithms was complex , and the outcomes could be perplexing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology classified data , so you were never sure what type of results you might get . However , the rapid adoption of the cloud and new technology tools have combined to help simplify machine learning and make it more accessible to a broader base of IT professionals . <p> Machine learning is data-driven , which means you need a lot of data to make it work . Furthermore , machine learning requires a lot of computational power , particularly to learn models . Fortunately , the cloud is ideally suited to deliver on these requirements and can also play an integral role in simplifying the use of machine learning and making the technology more affordable and manageable . <p> Additionally , there are also now a variety of commercially available tools that lower the barrier of entry and the complexity of machine learning while still working natively with the languages and frameworks used by the technology in the cloud . <p> For example , recently introduced drag and drop components give line-of-business ( LOB ) developers and power users the tools to complete many of the tasks needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Providing pre-packaged math and statistics ' routines ' , e.g. boilerplate code which previously could only have been created by statisticians <p> Assistance in preparing or "" featuring "" data ( for instance , many statistical models only work with numeric values , so these tools help by converting strings into numbers with numbering schemes or assigned ranges , etc. ) , and <h> Machine Learning 's Many Advantages <p> Of course , while machine learning has a considerable amount of raw power that can now be used more easily for data insights , we are not yet at a point where we can simply plug in data and get instant results . Raw data still needs cleansing to weed out flaws and exceptions , because until trained , machine learning ca n't recognise them . <p> While machine learning technology is still being trained , the most effective way to employ it is to combine it with the human expertise that can recognise data issues and exceptions that machines ca n't . This approach ensures that organisations take full advantage of machine learning 's ' unique prowess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , to gain a true competitive edge with machine learning , it 's essential to put some control into the hands of business users -- the people who really know the data and can bring their human insights to bear . <p> Combining business users ' insights with machine learning will allow companies to quickly leap forward in their analytics . Once they begin the process of making their machine learning smarter , they 'll start to experience exponential gains . Conversely , companies that are n't employing machine learning will find themselves miles behind those that have invested the human equity . <h> Operational Insights <p> Once the complexity associated with using machine learning has been stripped away , and companies have deployed resources to train the technology , a much broader base of business and IT professionals can leverage it to analyse larger data volumes and more data types than ever before . Businesses can now more easily employ machine learning for operational insights , to uncover patterns humans ca n't find and to look at countless data variables . <p> Massive volumes of data can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as : <p> Which products are likely to be bought together ? ( Collaborative filtering ) <p> Will an event happen in the future ? ( Classification ) <p> How much , what will be the number of ... ? ( Regression ) <p> Who are my gold customers ? ( Clustering ) <p> What will be the price of this stock in a month ? ( Gradient boosted tree ) <p> Is fraud occurring ? ( Decision tree ) <p> Is that image a known intruder ? SVM ( supervised learning ) <h> Governance <p> Of course , it goes without saying that machine learning is only as good as the data you feed it , so those using it need to create a solid data governance plan . Machine learning can do a great job of automating good decisions , but it can also dramatically increase the negative impact of bad decisions made using inaccurate data . In fact , data can even be used to intentionally infer alternative facts . Establishing guardrails against these potentially negative impacts is a must , particularly in light of growing data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far away as you think <p> Thanks to advances in technology , infrastructure frameworks , and growing cloud adoption , companies no longer need to rely exclusively on data scientists to reap the benefits of machine learning they just need the right tools -- and then , they too can become "" Google smart "" ."
"<p> We 've seen remarkable change in our lifetimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not just evolutionary change ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of behaviour and learn new skills . <p> We recently wrapped up the 17th annual B.C. Middle Market Growth Conference , where we tackled the overwhelming topic of disruption . This concept was n't new to our audience , but so much of what we hear and read about disruption is conceptual -- about things that could happen , or technologies with disruptive potential . <p> What 's missing from the conversation is how disruption is already transforming industries here in B.C. and reshaping the lives of the people who do business here . So , we gathered local entrepreneurs , deal-makers , financiers and financial executives -- along with internationally renowned speakers -- to talk about the trends unfolding in our market right now . <p> Here 's what we learned . <p> Transportation has already shifted gears . One of the big highlights of the day was the panel on autonomous electric vehicles ( AEVs ) , which have the potential for a large ripple effect -- disrupting other industries along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with driverless cars ? Or car dealerships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How will our urban landscape change : what becomes of parking lots ? While it might be 10 to 15 years before AEVs become ubiquitous , the technology has already become inextricably linked to city planning , safety and logistics . <p> Investing requires unprecedented flexibility . Today 's investors have to capitalize on opportunity as the landscape shifts before them . This means client demands are changing rapidly . Mainstream institutional and high-net-worth clients want to explore alternatives to traditional asset management . This means using previously under-represented asset classes like exchange-traded funds , hedge funds and private equity . More traditional asset managers have responded by reassessing every aspect of their business , from fees and operating models to diversifying the products in their portfolios . To stay nimble , firms are relying on emerging technology , including big-data analytics and artificial intelligence to generate higher risk-adjusted returns . <p> The deal-making landscape is shifting . The role of a mergers and acquisitions ( M&amp;A ) adviser has not fundamentally changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in innovation , data-room providers are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data , providers can "" score "" the marketing memorandums crafted by M&amp;A advisers . What 's more , these same groups are keeping track of the bidding behaviours of buyer groups -- including private equity -- providing data on bidding patterns to help advisers qualify potential buyers in the global marketplace . <p> Financial crime is getting harder to pull off . This year 's keynote speaker was Christine Duhaime , founder of the Digital Finance Institute and partner at Duhaime Law . The discussion began by educating attendees on blockchain and its application in digital currency . Until now , blockchain has mainly been used by those who try to transfer money illegally , but the double-sided ledger will change everything when it comes to fighting financial crime and corruption . The next step , according to Duhaime , is working together on a global set of values that allow for increased protection . She used Vancouver 's fentanyl crisis as a case study to illustrate how blockchain could be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of payment . <p> When it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many companies are innovative , few are disruptive . One of our panels featured Matt Switzer , chief operating officer of Hootsuite ; Penny Green , co-founder and director of Glance Technologies ; and Tony Guglielmin , chief financial officer of Ballard Power Systems -- all from disruptive local businesses influencing change globally . <p> All agreed that , when it comes to disruption , first-mover advantage is overrated . Instead , it 's better to be the ninth or 10th player in the market to learn from what others have done and where they have made missteps . Many first-movers are so far ahead of the curve , they launch before the market is ready for their product or idea . Those who come later are often better positioned to reap the rewards . <p> The B.C. Middle Market Growth Conference revealed a number of interesting dynamics , but the common thread was that B.C. is full of opportunities to innovate and inspire . We 're not just following the status quo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of companies innovating across different sectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot to learn from each other and a lot to accomplish by working together . * <p> Aleem Jinnah is director of the Association for Corporate Growth ( ACG ) and chairman of the B.C.

"<h> Motor Mouth : For self-driving cars to succeed , insurance has to change <h> With no one behind the wheel , automakers or tech developers will be at fault in crashes <p> A car equiped with an intelligent parking solution system , the Cyber Valet Services developed by Cisco and Valeo , is pictured at the Viva Technology event , on June 15 , 2017 in Paris.Bertrand Guay <p> There 's beginning to be an air of immediacy to this whole autonomous driving thing , a rising momentum that makes protestations of civil liberties lost ( as in some day we may not be allowed to drive our own cars ) and Rise of the Machine doomsdays ( i.e. , that the artificial intelligence we are building into our , well , machines will eventually come back to haunt us ) seem futile . Indeed , a spate of recent announcements says there 's a good chance we 'll be sipping champagne in the back of our computer-controlled cars long before Lord Elon manages to rid us all of the internal combustion engine . <p> First comes the news that Apple will be developing autonomous driving technology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- CEO Tim Cook calling it "" the mother of all AI projects "" -- the geniuses behind the iMac and iPhone will stick to what they do know ( computer hardware and software ) rather than sticking their noses into something ( building cars ) they know nothing about . Like Waymo -- Google 's new name for its division developing little self-driving roustabouts -- the world 's second most valuable company eventually realized there 's little point trading the extremely high profit margins ( 16.7 per cent in 2016 ) of the tech industry for the paltry three to six per cent pocket change common to automakers . With Waymo and Apple seemingly out of the car business , there 's a tad less pressure to rush to EVs , but an even larger focus at OEMs to get a giddy-up on their self-driving technology . <p> And , according to theinformation.com , it is these Silicon Valley interlopers that are leading the charge to driverless cars , the site 's auto-tech savvy senior writer , Amir Efrati , placing Waymo ( no surprise there ) at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop all its own hardware -- notably a Light Detection and Ranging ( LIDAR ) system superior to its competitors ' -- and a long-term focus only on self-driving . <p> It 's also not much of a surprise that Uber is right behind in second spot , the ride-hailing company 's main advantage not so much technology , but incentive , as any aspirations of future profitability rest on getting rid of all those pesky humans currently driving their definitely-not-taxis . Quietly assuming the third spot , meanwhile , is Daimler , the company 's long-time focus on high-tech electronic safety gadgets auguring well for the transformation to full-fledged autonomy . And since it sells its low-volume products to customers with relatively deep pockets , the traditional **28;1591;TOOLONG business model is not as threatened as lower-echelon automakers that will have to contend with volume drops as computerized cars promote the sharing of one car amongst multiple drivers ( and even multiple families ) . <p> Other contenders include Delphi ( General Motors ' parts producing spinoff ) and Tesla ( the most aggressively autonomous of current automakers ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and Baidu ( China 's Google ) offer some interesting technology , and it 's perhaps a bit surprising to some to see GM and its partnership with Cruise ahead of seemingly more audacious competitors . Indeed , Ford , despite its bold pronouncements of self-driving cars by 2021 , is not rated nearly as highly , in large part because its much-ballyhooed hookup with Google/Waymo fell through . <p> But , that 's just the who . Much more important is the how . <p> And by "" how , "" I do n't mean the technological innovations needed for an autonomous automobiles reality . Other than Tesla 's contention that LIDAR technology is an unnecessary expense , and a question of whether we really need vehicle-to-vehicle and **25;1621;TOOLONG technologies for self-driving success , the basic design of our driverless future has been written . <p> Rather , I 'm referring to the steps needed before we 're going to let a robot drive our cars anywhere . And if I am reading the nand/nor gate tea leaves right , a pronouncement by autoparts giant Valeo last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed , that makes self-driving cars not just inevitable but , more importantly , immediate . <p> Essentially , CEO Jacques Aschenbroich told the audience at the Paris Viva Technology that automakers -- and the high-tech firms supplying them driverless technologies -- should be liable if a self-driving car has an accident . In fact , Valeo 's chief executive told CNBC that , while "" the carmaker will have to be at the centre ... afterwards if we are responsible of some failure in our algorithm then it will come back to us . "" <p> This , as Motor Mouth detailed here , is a huge societal transformation from the current model that places all of the responsibility -- that should be read liability -- on the driver . But , as Valeo says , "" It can not be the driver anymore because in an autonomous automobile you have no driver . "" <p> The impact of this statement can not be underestimated . Automakers have long sought to reject responsibility for their products ' failures -- Ford for its exploding Pintos , General Motors for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their "" unintended acceleration . "" So , for automakers -- Volvo first broached this subject in 2015 when CEO Hakan Samuelsson said the company "" will accept full liability whenever one if its cars is in autonomous mode "" -- and now part suppliers to accept any and all liability for all the accidents their self-driving cars create is perhaps a bigger paradigm shift than even the electric vehicle revolution we have been promised . <p> If this newfound responsibility becomes reality , not only will autonomous technology have a devastating effect on industries like trucking ( three-million-plus truckers in North America suddenly becoming obsolete ) , but it also means the complete demise of the current automobile insurance industry , insurers and brokers alike . Instead of a supply chain -- there are about 40,000 insurance brokers in Canada and some quarter million in the United States -- that thrive on the policies of almost 300 million individual automobiles , a few large companies will simply need to insure the automakers and their autonomous technology supply chains with blanket policies . Or , as Paul Kovacs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insurance Industry in Canada study says , "" The very foundations for the personal automobile insurance industry in Canada -- that driver errors contribute to most collisions and personal ownership of vehicles is the norm -- may disappear . "" <p> In other words , Waymo may be leading the self-driving universe in technology , but , inevitably , it will be this question of responsibility that will determine when -- perhaps even if -- our cars enjoy the complete autonomy we keep being promised ."

"<h> Industrial profits rise 6% in May , first gain this year : NBS <p> By Yin Yeping Source:Global Times Published : 2020/6/28 18:08:58 <p> Photo : cnsphotos <p> As the resumption of business and production is underway , industrial enterprises continued to improve their performance , with growth in May turning positive for the first time this year . Analyst said that digitalization , price advantages and policy support will be the driving forces for sustainable development in the post-pandemic period . <p> Compared with the first two quarters , it is expected that the profits of industrial enterprises above designated size will maintain a growth rate of 6-8 percent on average in the second half of this year , with May being the starting point of economic resumption , industry analysts said . <p> This comment came after a report released by the National Bureau of Statistics ( NBS ) on Sunday stated that China 's industrial enterprises posted profits of 582.34 billion yuan ( $82.2 billion ) in May , up 6.0 percent from the previous year . <p> In May , the cost per 100 yuan of operating income of enterprises above designated size was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increase was one yuan less than that in April , relieving the pressure brought about by a sharp rise in unit costs since March and April , the report said . <p> Meanwhile , the price fluctuation of industrial products increased the profit space of enterprises . Producer prices fell 3.7 percent in May on the previous year , 0.6 percentage points more than in April . <p> The key driver behind this positive growth is that the gradual recovery of various industries after the resumption of work and production has eased pressure on rising costs , as well as the transformation in digitalization , analysts said . <p> Hong Tao , director of the Institute of Business Economics at Beijing Technology and Business University , told Global Times on Sunday that the global economic downturn has slowed the rising prices of raw materials such as fossil fuels and boosted the transformation of digitalization , speeding up the growth of the manufacturing sector . <p> Due to the effect of a number of favorable factors , such as the easing of cost pressures , improvements in market demand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the petroleum refining , electric power , chemical and steel industries have all improved significantly , becoming a driving force behind market growth , analysts said . <p> China 's economic order returned to normal in May , with some indicators of industrial physical volume picking up significantly , including power generation , which increased by 4.3 percent in May year-on-year , four percentage points higher than that in April , according to Meng Wei , spokesperson for the National Development and Reform Commission , at a press conference on June 16 . <p> "" Digital development also makes it possible for many businesses to run even when the world is still shadowed by the ongoing outbreak , "" Hong said . <p> However , although industrial profits rose in May for the first time this year , market demand is still weak following the impact of the pandemic , and the sustainability of this recovery remains to be seen . <p> From January to May , the profits of industrial enterprises above designated size nationwide totaled 1.84 trillion yuan , down 19.3 percent year on year , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At present , the market is not active enough to drive the economy towards a full recovery after the pandemic period , "" Hong said . <p> "" Sustainable development can be achieved by making full use of the price advantages of the resource market and helping businesses to expand the market while reducing costs . "" <p> Meanwhile , new infrastructure investment has been and will continue to be the new impetus to China 's post-epidemic economic growth and will bring a new round of market opportunities to relevant enterprises , Chen Naixing , a research fellow with the Institute of Industrial Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , told Global Times on Sunday . <p> "" Special bonds issued by central and local governments will further boost infrastructure investment as one of the important driving forces of industrial resumption , "" Chen noted . <p> In the long run , innovations in digital technologies such as artificial intelligence , 5G , industrial Internet and big data will provide technological capabilities for China 's transformation and development , Chen said ."

Registered in England and Wales . Number 8860726 . <h> Silicon Valley vs . Twin Cities : Your Questions Answered <p> At MD&amp;M Minneapolis 2019 a panel of experts tackled the question of whether or not Silicon Valley will eclipse Minneapolis as the largest U.S. medtech hub . Prior to the discussion , MD+DI readers weighed in on which U.S. metros they considered to be the top hub of medical device innovation . As recently reported , most ( 44% ) of the 100 survey respondents said the San Jose , CA region ( aka Silicon Valley ) is the top U.S. metro for medtech innovation . Minneapolis - St. Paul , MN came in second with 33% , followed by Boston - Cambridge , MA with 18% of the votes , and Austin , TX with 2% of the votes . The remaining 4% of survey respondents said "" other "" but did not specify a region , aside from one respondent who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . "" <p> The survey respondents also provided questions for the panelists , several of which appear in the following slides , along with the panelists ' responses . <p> "" One of the first things necessary is to have a clinician-driven invention process that understands the clinical capability of an invention or new idea , but also have a strong technology transfer team that knows how to license and not just to big companies with really deep pockets ... so licensing costs and things like that need to really be tailored to encourage entrepreneurs , "" Saunders said . "" Without naming names , one of the technology management groups covering a very large hospital network has a million-dollar signing fee ... that barrier right there is going to shut down most innovative startup companies , and that leaves only the really large medtech companies who , at the moment , are a little bit risk-averse just because of the downward pricing pressures and things like that . So you really need to have strong technology offices that have aggressive pricing programs to make sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Murdeshwar said it 's important to have a university or academic institution that can act as the center of gravity for the region 's medtech activity , but he added that it is equally important for there to be strong collaboration between the engineering school and the medical school . He was among the first class of fellows who went through the University of Minnesota 's medical device innovation fellowship program 10 years ago . <p> "" When they were looking around for where they could have a program like this there were only three places in the country that they could have this sort of a program in , "" Murdeshwar said . "" One is in the San Jose area with Stanford , the other place was Boston with Harvard and MIT , and the third place was the University of Minnesota in the Twin Cities . It 's no surprise that all these three places are key medical device hubs . There 's a third component and we tend to ignore it , which is common sense , practical politics ... all these three places -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economies , diverse economies , people are health conscious , and medical devices fit into all of that . ... I ca n't tell you how important that is . "" <p> Moran approached the question from a different perspective . "" You would be surprised , perhaps , to know that almost every industry is interested in medtech , "" she said . "" I 've got raw materials suppliers , oil and gas companies , they are interested in what 's going on in med device . They are seeing possibilities for growth , they are seeing possibilities for them to be a part of that growth in some form or another . The message I would give you is even with all these amazing characteristics and facilities that we have here , every large company that I work with is struggling with what they 're going to do , how they 're going to grow . And they 're worried about organic innovation , and they 're worried that some little startup somewhere is going to take their lunch . "" <p> Moran emphasized the importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's no longer acceptable to just invest in yourself and hope that you 're going to invent something , you 've got to buy your way in . You just have to , "" she said . "" I 've seen more of these corporations become more active in investments , whether it 's through corporate venture or it 's through purchase , and I think that 's a really positive thing . That means they do n't necessarily need to find that solution in their own backyard , they can find that anywhere . The world is moving so fast that those interesting solutions can pop up in unexpected places . "" <p> "" I 've worked with some other people at Olympus and Mayo Clinic and I see the talent there , everything is available ... there are lots of simple medical devices that are going to remain important , "" Saunders said . "" ... But for things like software embedded systems right now for better or for worse the top talent tends to be moving to either coast . So there 's a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean there is necessarily something missing from the talent pool in Minnesota , Saunders added , it 's just a matter of who is driving those particular paradigms . <p> Moran added that there is a different culture in the software development world than there is in what has traditionally been the medical device world . "" And although they are coming together , there still may be a cultural shift , "" she said . <p> He talked about how the hot technology trends in the industry used to center around mechanical systems and companies were rapidly hiring mechanical engineers to develop those devices . In some ways , he said , surgical robotics as the industry knows it today is even becoming "" old news , "" despite the fact that everyone in the industry seems to be excited and talking about it . The question we should , perhaps , be asking , he said , is "" where is all this headed ? "" <p> "" I wo n't tell you the answer -- I know where all this is headed , or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if you know the answer to that , then I will tell you that that 's not available in Minnesota today , "" Murdeshwar said . <p> "" First , we need a clear regulatory path from the FDA to put AI in medical devices , "" Saunders said , which is something FDA is actively working on today . "" AI has been around for quite a few decades and it 's essentially a prediction technology ... and it 's become super cheap to apply , but at the same time , you have to think about what it 's doing . "" <p> Saunders held up his wrist and pointed to his Apple Watch as an example . "" I still do n't know why I wear this thing , and yet I now wear the fifth generation of it because I ca n't seem to leave the house without it , "" he said , and he talked about the magnitude of the 400,00-participant Apple Heart Study at Stanford that "" provided real-time heart rate data for the first time ever . "" <p> "" From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded by Apple Watch and fed into a massive study that went into a machine learning algorithm that was able to then weed out people who were potentially having heart events , "" Saunders said . "" Now , it turned out that there were quite a few misses in that initial pass and the media jumped all over that , but that was n't the point . Because if you 're going to teach , say , Google Images , how to recognize a cat , you have to have "" not a cat . "" You have to teach Google Images ' that 's not a cat , that 's not a cat , that 's not a cat ... ' So this 400,000-person dataset showing the machine learning algorithm that ' hey here 's something that we thought was a heart event but really was n't ' , that just makes the machine learning better for the future , and then there are lives that ... their physicians are telling them ' had you not gotten this alert from your physician you probably would not be alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flip side , Murdeshwar pointed out that many medical device developers may be jumping on the AI bandwagon for all the wrong reasons . "" It reminds me of the time , years ago when I started my career and companies were moving into China , and I asked one of my friends , a supplier , ' why are you going to China ? ' and he said , ' I have no idea but I think it 's the politically correct thing to say and probably do ' , "" he said . "" So it 's the same thing with AI . It 's the politically correct thing to say and do , but like Dave said , AI has been around for a long time , the challenge is what are you going to do with AI ? I think I know exactly what I 'm going to do with AI , but I do n't think everyone else knows . "" <p> Saunders emphasized the importance of scalability and he said he has been networking with a major healthcare network in China and talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 back-to-back procedures a day . "" If my technology or my medical device solution slows them down , everybody suffers . It ca n't work because it 's not a scalable solution when you start to look at that , "" he said . <p> Pricing pressures in global markets is also a crucial point of consideration for any U.S. medical device company looking to expand outside the United States . "" I think it 's pretty amazing that the National Health Service in the United Kingdom has actually built an economic model that has shown that because of the trickle-down of getting more surgeons to do laparoscopy because of Intuitive Surgical 's da Vinci , that ultimately the da Vinci does , potentially , save money . It 's a very complex economic model but they 've been able to show that and that 's why the da Vinci is selling in the NHS now , "" Saunders said . "" If you go in there with a medical device that only costs more money , they 're going to shut you down . They will not buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that needs consideration from anybody . "" <p> Being from Olympus , Murdeshwar had a unique perspective to add on this question because Olympus is a Japanese company that expanded into America , rather than the other way around . "" The largest device market in the world is the U.S. so obviously it is very tempting to focus on U.S. healthcare needs but why Olympus has restructured around global lines is we realize that the OUS market is tremendous , but comes with the challenge of tweaking our devices , "" he said . "" A long time ago when I joined Olympus someone was saying that we should go into the Indian market and I said , ' how are you going to do that ? ' and they said ' well we take our device , it costs $500 and we take that device that 's two generations old and we 'll sell it there for $100 ' and I said ' good luck , that 's not going to work ' . We never made it into the Indian market . "" <p> Murdeshware went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China , and other parts of Asia are sophisticated markets that just require a completely different thought process . "" When I interact with people in these markets they look at me and say ' Nikhil , you 're thinking like a first-world guy , ' because I 'm thinking WiFi and wireless and they 're thinking cell phones and iPads and they do n't need a 4K screen and all that , "" he said . "" So companies like mine are beginning to get alerted to what the opportunities are overseas . "" <p> He added , however , that expanding into emerging markets does come with the challenge of realizing you ca n't just take a legacy device and sell it in Asia in the same way that you are selling it in the U.S. market . "" But with challenge there is opportunity , "" he said . "" I 'm tremendously excited that we have restructured along some of these lines and we 're thinking seriously about going after some of these markets .

"<h> The Top Story <p> After weeks of heat between Washington and Tehran , two oil tankers were attacked in the Gulf of Oman this week , and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Iran was to blame . <p> The escalation does n't just involve the United States and Iran , Kathy Gilsinan reports . Thursday 's attack -- which appeared similar to an attack on Saudi , Emirati , and Norwegian tankers last month -- showed how the conflict is growing and ensnaring many more countries . There 's Panama and the Marshall Islands , where the tankers are chartered ; Singapore and Taiwan , where the ships were bringing their cargo ; and Japan , which is home to a company that owns one of the tankers . <p> At the time , Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was in Iran meeting with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei . Abe said Khamenei told him that he has no intention of making or using nuclear weapons . <p> Pompeo said "" Iran is lashing out "" because it wants Washington 's "" successful maximum-pressure campaign lifted .

"<h> Big Is Better : Is Deep Learning Rigged Against Smaller Labs ? <h> Read Next <p> It has been recently established with OpenAI 's GPT-3 release that larger models perform better . Not just GPT , but other NLP models like T5 too have given better results compared to previous works . Historically , NLP systems have struggled to learn from a few examples . But , with GPT-3 , the researchers showed that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic , few-shot performance , sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches . While scaling up has been linked to increase unsupervised or at least semi-supervised performance , the same can not be said in the case of computer vision applications . <p> In order to explore the notion ' big is better ' , with CV models , the researchers at Google Brain , ran experiments with the modified SimCLR model -- SimCLRv2 . <p> They found that fewer the labels , the more the task-agnostic use of unlabeled data benefits from a bigger network ! <h> How Well Do Bigger Networks Perform ? <p> Learning from just a few labeled examples while making best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-standing problem in machine learning . An alternative approach for computer vision tasks is to leverage unlabeled data during supervised learning as a form of regularisation . <p> In this work , the proposed semi-supervised learning framework leverages unlabeled data in two ways : <p> task-agnostic use in unsupervised pre training , and <p> task-specific use in self-training / distillation <p> One approach to semi-supervised learning involves unsupervised or self-supervised pre training , followed by supervised fine-tuning . <p> Although it has received little attention in computer vision , this approach has become predominant in NLP , where one first trains a large language model on unlabeled text ( e.g. , Wikipedia ) , and then fine-tunes the model on a few labeled examples . <p> As shown in the plots above , the Top-1 accuracy of previous state-of-the-art ( SOTA ) methods and SimCLRv2 on ImageNet using only 1% or 10% of the labels . Dashed line denotes fully supervised ResNet-50 trained with 100% of labels . <p> The results show that bigger models are more label-efficient for both supervised and semi-supervised learning , but gains appear to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Smaller Labs ? <p> Poor graduate student : "" Damn these labs with huge compute , I ca n't compete with their model sizes ! Well , at least with my small models I can focus on label efficiency ! They generalize ! Occam 's razor ! Yay ! "" <p> At list-price , training the 11 billion parameter variant of T5 costs well above $1.3 million for a single run . And , with increasing runs , training costs might land up north of $10 million . <p> A similar but more rigorous approach was taken by Emma Strubell and her colleagues in a work published last year . The results of their work can be seen as follows : <p> With every new research , the idea of bigger networks being better is gaining more credibility . But who can afford to experiment with such large networks to check for any gains of any accuracy ? Definitely not individual researchers or startup AI labs . Companies like Google and OpenAI ( backed by Microsoft ) enjoy the advantage of high computational resources , which they can afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not have the resources to replicate the successes of larger organisations . We have seen last month how Uber was forced to wind down its AI labs due to unfavourable circumstances . The R&amp;D aspect of AI does n't look commercially viable in the short run , hence the smaller research groups will have no other way than to rely on the APIs released by the likes of OpenAI . Apart from this there is also a declining trend in the cloud computing costs . For instance , the prices on AWS were reduced over 65 times since its launch in 2006 , and by as much as 73% between 2014 and 2017 . <p> So we can safely assume that this trend will continue and computations become affordable . The compactness of networks is also an active area of research . Even in the case of above work by Google researchers with SimCLRv2 , it demonstrates that task-agnostically learned general representations can be distilled into a more specialised and compact network using unlabeled examples .

While the sector has been subject to various ups and downs over the last few years , there have been a few growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trend in the industrial sector is the acceleration of warehouse automation and smart factories . This trend was featured in a recent ' Logistics Report ' put together by The Wall Street Journal , which highlighted how the coronavirus pandemic has resulted in companies making deeper investments into logistics technology and distribution centres . <p> The trend is being driven by both an increase in online shopping and social distancing restrictions within warehouse operations , which is furthering a need for more technological solutions . Indeed , automation leader Honeywell 's HON ' Intelligrated Automation Investment ' study revealed that companies working in the e-commerce , food and beverage and logistics sectors are most willing to increase investments in automation . <p> I expect this to be a multi-year trend with several beneficiaries , including a number of currently private makers of robotic components . Technology advancements in robotics are moving quickly and improvements in sensing technology , machine learning and connectivity are likely to drive further investments from companies seeking to both increase supply chain efficiency and reduce costs . <p> Automation within logistics benefits both businesses and customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer errors and increased warehouse safety . Many companies refer to this overall movement as ' Industry 4.0 ' , which includes usage of cloud computing and blockchain technology for big data and analytics insights -- essentially , it marks the digital transformation of the industrial sector . <p> A budding market primed for growth <p> The global market for warehouse and logistics automation was valued at about $46bn in 2018 and forecasts expect it to reach $80bn by 2023 , with e-commerce expected to be the main driver fuelling the increase , according to ResearchandMarkets.com . <p> Mordor Intelligence , meanwhile , estimates the logistics automation market to be worth about $55.15bn in 2019 , but expects it to reach $107bn by 2025 , a 12% CAGR . Further adoption is also being driven by high warehouse rent prices , a shortage of skilled workers and micro-fulfilment centres . Furthermore , an environment with record low-interest rates and elevated capacity utilisation as well as aging equipment sets the stage for a strong investment cycle in automation to replace an ageing fleet . <p> The major players in the automation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the automation market ecosystem , of which I 've looked to provide a snapshot at the end of this article by highlighting 400 key players broken down into specific technology groups . Robotics companies are a hot area that has seen some recent deals , including Shopify SHOP buying 6 River Systems for $450m and Teradyne TER buying AutoGuide for $165m -- both companies work with collaborative mobile robots and automated guided vehicles . <p> Demand for mobile robots surged 60% in 2018 and is set to surpass a $3bn market by 2022 , according to Interact Analysis . Annual shipments of industrial robots are also increasing rapidly and creating a much larger installed base . A few other key US private companies to keep an eye on are Locus Robotics , Fetch Robotics , Rethink Robotics and IAM Robotics . <p> In the US , the main large-cap plays in the industrials space include Honeywell HON , Emerson EMR , Eaton ETN and Rockwell Automation ROK . However , these large companies also have a lot of other businesses , which may mean they wo n't see as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at mid-cap pure plays . <p> Top pure-play mid-cap picks <p> One of the most interesting names is Zebra Technologies ZBRA , which has a leading 40% market share in barcode printing as well as enterprise mobile computing and data capture solutions . Zebra Technologies is positioned well to capitalise on megatrends such as the internet of things ( IoT ) , enterprise mobility , cloud computing and e-commerce . <p> The Illinois-based company recently acquired Reflexis Systems , a leading provider of intelligent workforce management solutions , for $575m . Zebra Technologies recently noted an acceleration in interest in digitisation and automation across its key four vertical markets , specifically citing the grocer market as a large customer . The company also announced that it is planning to collaborate with Fetch Robotics later this year for warehouse picking . <p> PTC PTC , another one of my top mid-cap pure-play picks , is a leading maker of cloud software for industrial companies that has been investing in IoT and sees a long-term opportunity in computer-aided design , product lifecycle management and augmented reality markets . <p> The company has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Microsoft MSFT . Market research company International Data Corporation predicts that by 2022 , 70% of manufacturers will use cloud-based innovation platforms and marketplaces for cross-industry and customer co-development . <p> AMETEK AME is a favourite industrial tech play of mine , although it only has around a 10% exposure to the automation theme . It called out strength in the automation business , specifically in China , on its latest earnings call . <p> Cognex CGNX , meanwhile , is a leader in machine-vision products with exposure to factory automation as well as logistics and other end markets . Cognex 's products are also used to automate distribution processes in the logistics industry , including for applications in retail distribution and e-commerce to scan , track and sort goods through distribution centres . <p> Avery Dennison AVY is a player in labels and packaging that has a strong radio-frequency identification business and sees broader adoption in the apparel business as more companies are buying into their use for better inventory management , especially as omnichannel growth surges . <p> XPO Logistics XPO is also a top logistics play that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it launched a proprietary warehouse management platform called WMx that integrates robotics and other advanced automation into operations with a high degree of control , even when complex third-party software is involved . Its warehouse platform is a key competitive advantage , particularly in multi-channel environments . <p> The small-cap automation players to watch <p> After these mid-cap names , there are also a few interesting smaller industrial stocks such as Gates Industrial GTES , which is a small maker of power transmission and fluid power solutions that are used in warehouses , such as conveyor belts . <p> Matthews International Corporation MATW has an industrial technologies segment that delivers marking and coding equipment , consumables , industrial automation products as well as order fulfilment systems for identifying , tracking , picking and conveying consumer and industrial products for the warehousing and industrial industries . <p> Teledyne Tech TDY is a long-time favourite of mine . The company is a leading lidar ( light detection and ranging ) name that designs and manufactures sensors and modules for industrial robots . Its technology improves vision guidance for robots as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another small maker of lift trucks and components for various markets that has been positioning more in the fully automated and hybrid automated solution markets . <p> Moog MOG-A is an industrial company I have long favoured and is seen as undervalued . The company is a maker of precision components and controls . It noted in its latest annual report that "" an aging population and lack of skilled labor in many industries is increasing the need for more advanced robotics "" . <p> "" In addition , advances in sensors , arti ? cial intelligence and autonomous systems are making it possible to introduce new types of automation into old industries such as construction and agriculture . Moog is ideally positioned to take advantage of these macro trends . Our deep expertise in motion components and high-reliability systems , combined with our continuing investments in innovation , give us the tools to meet this emerging demand , "" the company said in a statement . <p> Belden BDC is a maker of connectivity solutions and cables that are used in many of these industrial automation tools and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising decline in the cost of robotics at its December investor day . It said : "" As labor costs have risen , the costs of robots , which is a good proxy for automation costs in general , have declined substantially . So labor is getting much more expensive with machines getting much less expensive . This , coupled with a historically low cost of capital with interest rates near all-time lows , creates a very compelling case for investments in automation . "" <p> Another important note it mentions is that "" beyond these favourable cost dynamics , the current historically long economic expansion cycle has resulted in elevated capacity utilization rates and aging equipment "" . "" Specifically , utilisation rates in the United States are approaching 80% and equipment age approaching 8 years or peak levels for this up cycle . These are typically good leading indicators of demand in addition to the favorable dynamics around industrial IoT that we benefit from . Aging and heavily utilized equipment should drive demand for replacement and upgrade . We expect this to support further investment in new automation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maker of advanced engineer materials that cites industrial automation as a key driver , while Barnes B is a small maker of precision components . The company 's automation business designs and develops robotic grippers , advanced end-of-arm tooling systems , sensors and other automation components for intelligent robotic handling solutions and industrial automation applications . <p> A few more small-cap stocks in the space include FLIR Systems FLIR , which is a maker of industrial vision products , often thermal imaging , and its camera business is instrumental to the machine vision industry . <p> Altra Industrial Motion AIMC is a maker of motion-control products with industrial automation and robotics cited as key growth end-markets . Allied Motion AMOT is a very intriguing $440m maker of motion-control components with applications for industrialised and specialised robots . <p> Applied Industrial AIT is a distribution play and is a leading distributor of a long list of products including bearings , power transmission products , engineered fluid power components , specialty flow control solutions , machinery , robotics automation products , industrial rubber products , linear motion components , tools , safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In closing , there are a number of angles to position for the ' Industrial 4.0 revolution ' that is in the early stages of an accelerated transformation due to the technological improvements in robotics , automation software , AI and machine learning . <p> 400 Key Players in Warehouse Automation Market Ecosystem <p> Disclaimer Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results . <p> CMC Markets is an execution-only service provider .

"<h> Planning for Aggression : Netanyahu 's Nuclear Archive <p> It all seems like an effort to confirm offensiveness and instability , to be appalling in order to be relevant . The Israeli prime minister , handicapped by domestic travails and a watchful Knesset , is very keen to push the Iranian demon into the spotlight , making the case that the wily mullahs in Tehran are not to be trusted on anything from weapons development to security ambitions . ( Such points tend to be of equal application to their accusers : in this case , the refusal to accept , or deny , that Israel is a nuclear state at all . To each his own . ) <p> The effort of tying Iran to agreements hammered out with the UN Security Council 's Permanent Five and Germany -- the so-called Iran nuclear deal or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action -- had the effect of placing a halt on the Persian nuclear juggernaut , though it did have a heavily qualified sense to it . The ultimate point there was one of regional stability : the moment Iran acquires such a device , Saudi Arabia has vowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Islamic Republic on the straight and narrow would , at the very least , maintain some tense status quo . <p> Israel 's leader , Benjamin Netanyahu , will hear none of that . He has gone through another phase of urgent warning against the deal , donning his doomsday fatigues in the hope that leaders will listen to his blood curdling warnings of theocratic Armageddon . His voice of fear was been heard across various capitals , suggesting nothing less than a degree of incitement . <p> It all came about with a Monday night bonanza at the end of April , featuring a display of turning intelligence into the raw material of crude politics , a lights-and-camera briefing designed to draw in the ratings and interest of foreign television networks . "" That 's what he was after , "" wrote Yossi Verter for Haaretz . "" And that 's also why the presentation was made in English , which is anyway the language in which Bibi feels most at home . We , the natives , are small fry . "" <p> The title of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lied "" . During his speech , he made good use of props , pulling back a curtain to reveal bookshelves stacked with files , CDs and various copies of original Iranian documents gathered by Israeli agents . This was the "" nuclear archive "" covering Iran 's 1999-2003 nuclear weapons program known as Project Amad , in of itself not a clear breach of the JCPOA . Having not disclosed the nature or extent of this program , Iran , argued Netanyahu , entered into the 2015 agreement under false pretences . <p> As Or Rabinowitz noted with some salience , "" The deal did not require Iran to tell the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth . "" The prevailing expectation was that Tehran would supply the IAEA ( International Atomic Energy Agency ) with "" explanations regarding outstanding issues "" but those economic with the verite were not made the basis for voiding the deal . <p> While the archive also reveals morsels beyond the clandestine items usually kept within the intelligence community , Netanyahu 's implied purpose was to impute bad faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This extravagant display had the express purpose not only of tarring the country and its leadership , but also with keeping members of his Cabinet in check . At the very least , it would grant the PM near imperial powers to go to war even in the absence of the security cabinet convening . <p> It was also designed to overturn a perception that Netanyahu has had it rough on the issue of intelligence successes , linked as he was with Mossad 's bungling 1997 effort to assassinate Hamas senior figure Khaled Meshaal in Jordan . ( As a trade-off to save exposed Mossad agents from conviction and execution by Jordan , Netanyahu relented in supplying the antidote that revived a poisoned Meshaal . ) <p> As Labor Party leader Avi Gabbay observed , the speech was "" a valuable gift "" showing that Netanyahu was capable "" of mixing political considerations with state security "" . More to the point , the Iran nuclear trove had given Netanyahu a thick life line , with Yair Lapid 's Yesh Atid and Gabbay himself striking the no-confidence motion off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Netanyahu is so convinced about Iran he has sought to press its ally in Syria . Russia 's Vladimir Putin has been told to put the brakes on Iranian advances in Syria and Lebanon , a point that brings Tehran into proximity with Israel 's borders . Moscow , in turn , has made it clear that continued Israeli strikes of the sort that took place on the T-4 airfield in Homs are to stop . Such acts of aggression are deemed destabilising , though they have become very much part of the brutal normality that is the Syrian conflict . <p> Where Netanyahu has the most sympathetic of voices is in the White House , where he already has a good running . President Donald Trump is certainly doing more than flirt with the idea of withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal , though he has promise till May 12 to make the decision . <p> Israeli belligerence and frothy insistence on voiding the JCPOA has one logical and dangerous consequence . It feeds the reactionaries and super patriots , not to mention the argument that having such weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atrocious ; why disappoint ? <p> At most , the archive unveiled by Israel shows cheek on the part of Tehran 's leadership to play loosely with its obligations as a Non-Nuclear Weapon State , being a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty . But as long as powers such as Israel remain undeclared nuclear states , and Iran maintains its reputation in some quarters for bloody villainy , such violations are bound to be expected . <p> The public brawl between Energy Minister Megan Woods and BP looks like spinning off -- as brawls tend to do -- into a whole array of extraneous matters . Evidently , some people find it hard to see the difference between taxes and profits . More&gt;&gt; <p> After nine years of media complacency about the systematic underfunding of the health system by the National government -- as signified by the steady erosion since 2010 , of the share of GDP devoted to Vote Health -- we are now being invited to have a cow because the coalition government is n't fixing all the problems in public health within nine months ! More&gt;&gt; <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of it , and nor should it be . It also marshals those facts and creates a story from them , usually one with a moral that 's implied or explicit . After six months though , it is still unclear just what the dominant media narrative is of the coalition government . Is it Idealistic But Impractical ? Is its Heart in the Right Place , but is it Taking On Too Much ? Is the coalition proving to be Fractious And Unstable , or is it Surprisingly Adept at Keeping Its Inherent Rifts Out of the Public Eye ?

"<h> Read Next <p> "" Empathy , evidently , existed only within the human community , whereas intelligence to some degree could be found throughout every phylum . "" <p> ? Philip K. Dick <p> Moral dilemmas are a part of human nature . Though the actions can be condensed to simple yes or no checkboxes , the intentions however , fall in an intangible gray area , which is very tricky to decipher . Now , if machines , which are innately binary ( 0s &amp; 1s ) , are tasked with similar decision-making at ethical crossroads , the chances for erratic behaviour are quite high . Only in this case , blaming would n't improve machines . The domain of reinforcement learning especially , which tries to mimic the cognitive functions of the human mind , can be a good place to investigate machines in moral uncertainties . <p> Researchers Adrien Ecoffet and Joel Lehman , formerly of Uber AI , while acknowledging moral uncertainty , proposed a formalism that translates philosophical insights to the field of reinforcement learning . <p> In a philosophical framework , "" saving a life "" can be immediately associated with good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of machines might require "" rotating the 5th joint of the robot arm 3 degrees clockwise . "" One of the key contributions of this work is to provide concrete implementations of moral uncertainty , bridging the gap between options and actions . <h> Philosophy Through The Lens Of RL <p> One benefit of translating moral uncertainty from a philosophical framework to a sequential decision making is that more of the gritty complications of real-world moral decision-making come into clarity , which may suggest concrete research problems or connections to existing research in RL . <p> To explore what methods can be quantified into a decision making framework , the researchers have explored the following : <p> Maximising Expected Choice Worthiness <p> Stochastic Voting <p> Nash Voting <p> Variance Voting <p> All the experiments in this work are based on four related gridworld environments that tease out differences between various voting systems . These environments are all based on the popular trolley problem , used to highlight moral intuitions and conflicts between ethical theories . Trolley problem is a tricky ethical dilemma where an observer has the control of changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options -- to kill five people and save one or save five and kill one person . In the latter case , the number of people saved are high but that would also pose a question on what made the observer decide that one person deserved to die . <p> In the experiments , as illustrated above , the agent ( A ) is standing on the switch ( S ) tile by the time it reaches the fork in the tracks ( + ) tile , the trolley ( T ) will be redirected and crash into the bystander(s) . The agent may also push a large man ( L ) onto the tracks , to stop the trolley . Otherwise , the trolley will crash into the people standing on the tracks represented by random variable X.

This whole body of work highlights a spectrum of machine learning research questions relevant to training ethically capable reinforcement learning agents . <p> There are few key concepts such as credence updating that have n't been discussed as they are beyond the scope of this article . In short , credence can be looked at as a crucial part of a mathematical equation that decides the actions of an RL model .

However , there are a couple of challenges . One is to create implementations of ethical reward functions that can be applied in the real world or at least in complex simulations ( eg : self driving cars ) . <p> Another challenge is to create more complicated machine ethics benchmark tasks . Popular RL benchmarks , such as Atari or Go , are designed to fit the standard paradigm , i.e. a single metric of success or progress . The authors also suggest retrofitting few of these benchmarks to include various conceptions of morality such as including the utilities of "" enemies "" or the violations of deontological considerations . <p> Towards that end , the researchers are hopeful that their work will lead to future work in which algorithms can be tested for machine ethics in more complex domains such as a high-dimensional deep RL setting ."
"<p> During a 2017 casino tournament , a poker-playing program called Libratus deftly defeated four professional players in 120,000 hands of two-player poker . But the program 's co-creator , Tuomas Sandholm , did not believe artificial intelligence could achieve a similar performance against a greater number of players . <p> Two years later , he has proved himself wrong . Sandholm has co-created an AI program called Pluribus , which can consistently defeat human experts in six-player matches of no-limit Texas Hold'em poker . "" I never would have imagined we would reach this in my lifetime , "" says Sandholm , a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University . <p> Past AI victories over humans have involved two-player or two-team games such as checkers , chess , Go and two-player no-limit poker . All of these games are zero-sum -- they have just one winning side and one losing side . But six-player poker comes much closer to resembling real-life situations in which one party must make decisions without knowing about multiple opponents ' decision-making processes and resources . "" This is the first major benchmark that is not two-player or two-team zero-sum games , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AI Research and co-creator of Pluribus . "" For the first time , we 're going beyond that paradigm and showing AI can do well even in a general setting . "" <p> The Pluribus program first proved its worth by playing profitably in six-player games that pitted just one human against five independent versions of Pluribus . It went on to win money in matches with five human players ( taken from a rotating cast of 15 poker professionals who have each won at least $1 million in tournaments ) versus one AI over 10,000 hands of poker and 12 days of games . These successes are detailed in a paper published this week in Science . Although Pluribus did not reach a win rate quite as high as Libratus or another two-player poker program called DeepStack , it still notched a very respectable win rate . "" When the bot was sitting down with humans , it was making a lot of money , "" Brown says . "" I would certainly characterize that as a superhuman performance . "" <p> "" Though there was already evidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-player environments , it was not clear they would suffice to reach the highest professional level of play , "" says Michael Wellman , a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan , who was not involved in the study . "" It is really news that this worked so effectively for six-player poker . This is a pretty big deal -- certainly a notable milestone . "" <p> To reach this level , Pluribus -- like its predecessor Libratus -- first played against itself over many simulated hands of poker , developing a strategy blueprint . The big breakthrough that let it tackle six-player poker came from its "" depth-limited search feature . "" That component allows the AI to look ahead several moves and figure out a better strategy for the rest of the game , based on possible opponent decisions . Many other poker-playing programs have used similar search features , but doing so with six players would require an impractical amount of computing memory : there are too many scenarios to simulate , based on what cards each player holds , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betting decisions that follow . Libratus got around this bottleneck by only using searches in the final two ( out of four ) betting rounds -- but that solution still required the use of 100 central processing units ( CPUs ) in a game with only two players . <p> So Pluribus instead deployed its depth-limited search . With this technique , the AI first considers how it and its opponents might play for the next few moves . Beyond that point , it simplifies its model by restricting each simulated player 's choices to only four strategies : the precomputed blueprint , one biased toward folding , another biased toward calling and a fourth biased toward raising .. This modified search helps explain why Pluribus 's success in six-player poker required relatively minimal computing resources and memory in comparison with past superhuman achievements in gaming AIs . Specifically , during live poker play , Pluribus ran on a machine with just two central CPUs and 128 gigabytes of memory . "" It 's amazing this can be done at all , and second , that it can be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "" Sandholm says . By comparison , DeepMind 's famous AlphaGo program used 1,920 CPUs and 280 GPUs during its 2016 matches against top professional Go player Lee Sedol . <p> Carnegie Mellon University and Facebook plan to make the Pluribus pseudo code -- a detailed explanation of each necessary step in the program -- available alongside the published paper , so that other AI researchers can generally reproduce their efforts . But the team decided not to release the actual code ; this would likely facilitate the spread of superhuman poker-playing programs , which could be extremely disruptive to the online poker community and industry . Even without the code , though , humans can start learning from the AI 's strategies . For example , professional poker players usually consider it a mistake to make a "" donk bet "" -- starting a round by betting aggressively after having ended the previous round by nonaggressively matching an existing bet . But Pluribus ended up using this technique much more frequently . <p> Beyond poker , this AI could potentially find applications in any situation when a person must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thinking or doing . Such areas could include cybersecurity , financial trading , business negotiations and competitive price setting . Sandholm says the AI could even help in the party primaries for the 2020 U.S. presidential election : candidates competing in a packed field could theoretically benefit from AI suggestions on spending just enough advertising money to win in key states , making the most of a limited war chest . Sandholm has founded three start-ups , including the companies Strategic Machine and Strategy Robot , that might incorporate this multiplayer AI into the services they offer to business and military clients . <p> For its part , Facebook does not have immediate plans for exploiting the poker-specific Pluribus . But Brown plans to further explore how AI performs in more complex multiplayer scenarios that go beyond card games . "" We 're going to close the books on poker now , because this was the final milestone , "" Brown says . "" Now we 're looking to extend this beyond poker .

"<h> Feature request : Recorded Summon <p> This would be a nice addition to Enhanced/Smart Summon , and I could see it being a lot more useful in certain cases . It 's basically Summon without monitoring - which we know is going to take a while - but with a recorded driving action . <p> Use case : I 'd love my car to be able to perform a "" recorded "" Summon at the tap of a button . Example : Instead of me holding down the Summon button and waiting there while my car pulls itself out of the garage ( for the first time every time ) , I could simply tap a single button while I 'm still upstairs and the car is waiting for me in the driveway . <p> In order to set this up , I 'd simply hop in the car , hit "" record "" and then back out and do whatever other adjustments I wanted the car to do . This would make even more sense with more complicated maneuvers , such as backing out of a garage and pulling up to a house in a certain way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the street , flipping itself in a driveway , etc . As opposed to a full FSD maneuver with associated wonkiness , it would simply perform the action exactly as the driver did when recorded . Since it could also record GPS location etc. , it would ensure the "" action "" was only used in the same spot it was intended for . <p> Seems like it would be a shortcut to more complicated Summon behaviors for repeat locations ( basically , home ) . Thoughts ? <p> It seems that for this to work , the car would have to be in EXACTLY the same position and orientation to start the maneuver as it was when you recorded it . But they might be able to develop a mode where you provide many examples of how to perform a maneuver like backing out of your driveway , and a machine learning algorithm learns what are the important features for it . <p> So this is exactly what the new BMW 3 series does for their automated reverse . It will back up exactly how it went forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse itself out of a complicated parking situation . Only difference is your still in the drivers seat . <p> I would actually like sort of the reverse of this . We have a parking spot that takes a bit of maneuvering to get into and tucks in close to a wall on the drivers side in an ideal stopping point . It would be great if I could identify the spot and through a combination of GPS and camera reference the car could learn the spot , and auto park in it . It 's always the same exact spot , and there are some landmarks that could indicate when the car is in the right position . Recording seems like it could be good , but then you are dependent on a starting point and everything staying the same . If they were able to identify a destination to a very high level of precision , the process of pathing there in a driveway might be easier . E.g. auto park + summon + known destination does n't seem like a huge stretch over say a 50ft distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yeah there would need to be a way to compensate for small differences in position - and like dougb00 said , machine learning could do this , whether by learning through several recordings of the same maneuver or perhaps by combining the computer vision rules ( e.g. of drivable space ) with the recording of driver input . So in an example of reversing out of a driveway and pulling curbside , the car would be able to modify the action and still avoid the curb even if the action was started a few inches from where it was originally recorded and would send the car into the curb if replicated exactly . <p> And yes , @maketm , although all the examples that seemed immediately relevant ( for me ) involved reversing out of a garage/driveway , there 's no reason why it could n't be any number of complex maneuvers that people deal with at their home/work . Another example would be a repetitive swapping of positions with another vehicle . You could operate the non-Tesla while using one or more actions to control the Tesla and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle . <p> So this is exactly what the new BMW 3 series does for their automated reverse . It will back up exactly how it went forward for a certain amount of distance allowing the car to reverse itself out of a complicated parking situation . Only difference is your still in the drivers seat . <p> Click to expand ... <p> Similar , but I 'm thinking more complicated maneuvers and the ability to "" recall "" them at any time , as long as the car is in the right GPS location . I 'm not familiar , but the BMW setup sounds like it 's literally to "" undo "" the position of the car . <h> Meta <p> Do you value your experience at TMC ?

"<p> There are many reasons why old-style electric cooperatives , the transmission company and mainstream power generators dislike the "" minigrid "" concept introduced by Solar Para sa Bayan . The concept is totally disruptive . <p> The "" minigrid "" concept involves a small area where solar power can be supplied directly to consumers . With technologically advanced batteries solar power may be stored and distributed to consumers 24 hours a day , 365 days in the year . <p> This concept cuts off commissions to the local electricity cooperative and the transmission company . As the "" minigrids "" proliferate , they could grab significant market share from the large generation plants that were built using billions in investment . The financing costs for those large plants add to the generation costs eventually passed on to consumers . <p> Not too long ago , solar power was too expensive to even consider on a significant scale . Without the advanced battery storage technology we have now , solar power was unreliable . We had power when the sun was up , insufficient power on a cloudy day and no power at nighttime . <p> The rapid march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course there will be panic among those who have sunk their money in old business models . <p> With the great strides taken by information technology and artificial intelligence , the acronym VUCA has quickly gained currency in the business community . The acronym stands for volatility , uncertainty , complexity and ambiguity . <p> For instance , some European countries are now considering banning all vehicles powered by hydrocarbons . Some major cities will have only electric cars on their streets in a few short years while we still debate the future of the jeepney and wonder when we might have a truly functional international airport . <p> In one of the corporate boards I sit in , we are considering convening a strategic planning workshop to assess the effects of new financial technologies ( Fintech ) on our basic business model . We need to adopt new strategies to cope with the disruptive effects of the new technologies on our brick-and-mortar business . Unless we adjust promptly , the new technologies could spell an existential threat . <p> I could imagine the dread that envelopes the corporate boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a highly centralized transmission system and a wholesale market for daily trades in power supply . It is a large and centralized army in the old Prussian mold now threatened by small guerilla units spawning "" minigrids "" all over like mushrooms on a moist field . <p> The dread probably doubled when Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi declared his support for granting Solar Para sa Bayan a franchise . <p> From the standpoint of the country 's top energy manager , the "" minigrid "" concept opens an alternative route for achieving 100% electrification in the country . It could bring affordable power to remote communities stranded from the main transmission grid . For this reason , he calls the "" minigrid "" a "" positive disruptive development . "" <p> What he has yet to realize is that "" minigrids "" could become a full-scale insurrection . <p> Some of our rural electric cooperatives are most vulnerable . They are undercapitalized and badly managed . They do not fully cover their franchise areas when it is not profitable for them to do so . They operate with large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers . In a word , they are vulnerable to new technologies that will contest their market . <p> Cusi does not seem disposed to protect the dinosaurs . He is quoted as saying : "" We can not let Filipinos wait forever . There are efficient cooperatives and there are inefficient cooperatives . Are we going to allow Filipinos to suffer because of inefficient cooperatives ? I do n't think that is right . "" <p> He is correct . The reason our economy is so screwed up is because we spent decades protecting businesses that have ceased to be competitive . We tried stopping the winds of change to protect oligarchs . We resisted new technologies because they threatened old businesses . <p> The only way we can liberate our economy is to make all markets contestable . An inefficient electric cooperative , for instance , is an invitation to contestation by alternative energy providers . This is the reason why a nationwide franchise for Solar Para sa Bayan is such a game-changer . Instead of protecting little electric fiefdoms that serve their customers badly , we now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Solar Para sa Bayan is now serving 12 towns in varied such provinces as Mindoro , Palawan , Masbate , Cagayan and Aurora . <p> When the last typhoon struck , Dingalan town in Aurora remained continuously powered even as cell phone services went down . The town is served by a solar-powered "" minigrid "" that continued delivering electricity through the storm and its aftermath . <p> In Calayan , Cagayan , Solar Para sa Bayan installed a "" minigrid "" that allowed the town to be fully powered around the clock even as power in the rest of the province was cut off because of damaged transmission lines . This is the first time the town enjoyed uninterrupted power supply . <p> In Claveria , Masbate , the municipality 's 45,000 people now receive round-the-clock power for the first time ever . This will have revolutionary effects on the town 's productivity . <p> In the areas ravaged by Typhoon Ompong , Solar Para sa Bayan quickly put up "" minigrids "" in many areas where local electric cooperatives took too long to bring up their system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uninterrupted power brings many good things . Vegetables could be saved from spoilage by refrigeration relying on consistent power supply . <p> Mao Zedong would have fully understood what Solar Para sa Bayan is up to . It is surrounding the cities from the countryside . <p> I have long suggested that the Land Transportation Office or LTO be liberated from its mother unit , the Department of Transportation and make the LTO an independent entity similar if not stronger than the DMV or Department of Motor Vehicles in the United States ."

From my perspective , the key challenges include making sure we are doing enough to identify suitably qualified women candidates and that we are giving our existing women the opportunity to broaden their experience . To help address this we now ensure we have a female candidate interviewed for every role , and all interview panels contain at least one women . We have also introduced rotational program for female managers to develop broad-based banking careers and both these programs are delivering incredibly positive results . <p> Mick McCormack , APA <p> How is the world of low returns impacting on your business and your decision making ? Are you more or less likely to invest overseas in 2017 ? <p> As the owner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our decision making process reflects our long term vision to deliver sustainable growth and to continue to grow returns to securityholders.This will continue in 2017 , as we continue to execute on around $1.5 billion of organic growth opportunities we have identified over the next three years . Looking further out to 2030 , we see growth capex opportunities of around $5 billion in our core gas transmission business alone . Additionally , we are also looking to develop further our renewable energy portfolio as Australia moves towards a more renewable and cleaner energy future.In terms of offshore markets , we are continuing to conduct due diligence on the North American market generally . It is a well-developed and low-risk market , with strong long-term gas supply/demand fundamentals . We see potential opportunities following the unprecedented growth in shale gas and increasing financial pressures driven by the 65 per cent decline in gas prices since 2014 . Any future decision to invest would remain consistent with our strategy of investing in energy infrastructure underwritten by long term contracts with highly creditworthy counterparties . <p> Do you consider that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business as its growing middle class comes with questions about the economy 's debt buildup and rising political and regulatory risks ? There is no doubt that rising energy demand from China will continue to see it , as well as other Asian markets , play an increasingly important role in the development of the energy sector globally.APA 's strategy remains focused on supporting our customers in meeting the rising need for energy . Our low-risk business model requires any investments to be in established markets with well-developed and stable business , legal and regulatory environments . <p> How concerned are you about Australia losing its AAA credit rating ? What , in your opinion , are the implications for your business of a cut in the rating ? Like any successful long-term business , APA believes in the importance of maintaining strong and stable credit ratings . APA is committed to maintaining our stable BBB and Baa2 credit ratings which support the continued delivery of sustainable future growth and provide access to global capital markets to fund such growth.Our ratings are underpinned by a solid financial foundation : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and long-dated spread of maturities , all underpinned by long-term contracts with creditworthy counterparts . We do n't believe that a change to Australia 's sovereign rating will have any impact on our own rating.We will continue to look to the broad range of highly liquid global debt capital markets to fund our business and in that regard we have more interest in rates in those markets that we do with the AAA rating for the Australian government . <p> Are you worried about the chaos and dysfunction in Canberra ? What policy reforms do you think should be prioritised in the interests of the nation in 2017 ? <p> Uncertainty of any sort , and regulatory risks in particular , are not good for business or investment . There is no doubt that everyone is keen to see more streamlined and consistent policy decision making coming out of Canberra.During 2016 , the South Australia power crises meant businesses and households experienced first-hand the significant costs of the continued inconsistent approach in energy policy . APA supports the Federal government 's move , through COAG , towards a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the differing state-based energy and renewables policies is key to ensuring the reliability , efficiency , security and affordability of energy across the nation.The east coast gas market was also high on the government agenda during 2016 . There were various reviews , under the auspices of the COAG Energy Council , where APA presented views of how current regulations have underpinned some $30 billion in pipeline investment since 2000 . We are encouraged by the recent industry consultation process conducted by the Gas Market Reform Group , led by Dr Vertigan , and are hopeful that 2017 will see recommendations that support continuing investment and innovation by industry participants . <p> What do business leaders need to do in response to the anti-business sentiment on both sides of politics and in the broader community ? <p> There needs to be clearer communication from business about the private sector 's contribution to nation-building , job creation and economic development for all . The provision of energy is an essential service and we take our obligations to our stakeholders and the nation seriously.We need to continue to communicate our mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are proud of our achievements in building a unique gas transmission grid that delivers cleaner and more reliable energy to Australia , and is supporting the exponential growth of the gas industry in this country.APA has invested some $10 billion in its East Coast Grid and services have revolutionised gas supply to customers by connecting great distances between production and end-users.We believe our good corporate reputation is an integral part of our growth as a long term sustainable business . We are also mindful that we have a responsibility to give back to the communities within which we operate . This is why we have a dedicated community investment program that has continued to support the future prospects of vulnerable Australians since 2010 . Moving forward , we are expanding this program to allow our employees to volunteer and to further support diversity and inclusion in our community . <p> Are you more or less likely to invest in automation this year than last year ? If so what type of automation ? Also , what are the specific measures you are taking to digitise your business ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve our efficiencies through process enhancements and IT investment so that we might bring more optionality , reliability and flexibility to our customers and the market as a whole.As a leading innovator , we have invested over $12 billion in the past 16 years to develop infrastructure and innovate to meet customer requirements and market needs . In 2016 , we launched our Integrated Operations Centre which is the result of tens of millions of investment in innovative systems and state of the art technology , offering customers more flexibility and opportunities when managing their energy portfolio across all APA assets . <p> How much risk of power interruptions and cost increases do you assess for your business as baseload coal power generation is phased out and the electricity system becomes more reliant on renewables such as wind power ? <p> We believe gas is ideally placed to be the transition fuel to Australia 's cleaner energy future , through managing peak energy requirements in a reliable and secure fashion . The real problem here is the disjoint state-based energy policies . This has led to detrimental impacts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in South Australia . APA supports the Federal government 's actions to develop a national approach to energy and renewables policy , in order to prevent a repeat of such issues.From APA 's perspective , we have always believed in gas as the transition fuel to Australia 's cleaner energy future , shifting it away from reliance on black &amp; brown coal fired generation , whilst sustaining Australia 's economy . We therefore see opportunities in this shift , but believe that it needs to be done in a way that makes economic sense as nation-wide solution . <p> Do you think the RBA will raise or lower interest rates next year ? <p> APA believes that the RBA is best suited to determine any decisions with respect to interest rates . At APA , we are focused on building on the long term success of our business irrespective of the interest rate environment . We do this through maintaining our solid financial foundation and our low-risk business model , underpinned by our long-term contracts with highly creditworthy counterparts . We remain confident we are well placed to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are based on long term considerations rather than short term economic indicators . <p> Do you feel positive or negative about a Trump presidency and why ? <p> As one of the largest owners and operators of energy infrastructure in Australia , our business is not in the first instance directly affected by who sits in the White House . However as we continue our due diligence on the North American markets , we are watching this space closely.Based on the indications sent to the market following Trump 's acceptance speech , my initial thought is that he is pro-business , keen to streamline regulations and looking to invest in infrastructure developments . This is supportive of growth in our existing business and the due diligence process we are currently doing on the US , the largest gas transmission market in the world . <p> What are the challenges , if any , to increasing the percentage of female leadership at your firm ? What are the numbers and percentage of women who are direct reports to the CEO at your firm ? <p> Female representation at APA in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 29 per cent ( 2 of the 7 direct reports are women ) . We know that to become a leading innovator and to continue our strong performance and growth , we need to find creative ways to enhance our people capabilities and we do that by encouraging inclusion and diversity of thought , gender , ethnicity and age . There are challenges , especially in terms of increasing the number of women in our operational and technical areas , but we are looking at ways to address this in how we recruit , arrangements and opportunities we offer at work and ensuring we have a positive culture . We have a Diversity and Inclusion Committee to help drive a number of initiatives to increase diversity within the organisation . <p> Dominic Stevens , ASX <p> How is the world of low returns impacting on your business and your decision making ? Are you more or less likely to invest overseas in 2017 ? <p> In a world of low returns underlying growth is harder to come by . We are focussed on a number of new business initiatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the heart of the A$ and NZ$ markets . <p> Do you consider that China is a more or less an attractive market for your business as its growing middle class comes with questions about the economy 's debt buildup and rising political and regulatory risks ? <p> Right now , China as ' a market ' is less applicable to our business . We would like to encourage further connections between Australia and China through direct Renminbi transfers via ASX 's cash and securities settlement hub . Capital flows out of China are currently constrained by regulation . In the long run , once capital flows more freely , even a fraction of the investment wealth of the Chinese middle class allocated to the Australian capital markets will make China an attractive place from which to provide access to ASX . <p> How concerned are you about Australia losing its AAA credit rating ? What , in your opinion , are the implications for your business of a cut in the rating ? <p> I believe a strong fiscal position gives the economy significantly more flexibility to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is never positive for business if your country is downgraded .

What policy reforms do you think should be prioritised in the interests of the nation in 2017 ? <p> Business and community confidence is best served by governments able to make decisions and implement stated policies . I continue to believe that policies that encourage innovation - particularly in the technology sector - will bear significant fruit over the long-term . <p> What do business leaders need to do in response to the anti-business sentiment on both sides of politics and in the broader community ? <p> All businesses -- regardless of size -- have a responsibility to listen and communicate meaningfully , transparently and respectfully to their community of stakeholders . This is broader than shareholders -- but it makes good business sense for shareholders that companies do this . ASX plays an important role in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we communicate what we do . <p> Are you more or less likely to invest in automation this year than last year ? If so what type of automation ? Also , what are the specific measures you are taking to digitise your business ? <p> ASX is in the midst of a program to upgrade its technology and better digitise its business . Current initiatives include the rollout of a new derivatives trading platform , improving our ability to access and manage data , and investigating blockchain technology . <p> How much risk of power interruptions and cost increases do you assess for your business as baseload coal power generation is phased out and the electricity system becomes more reliant on renewables such as wind power ? <p> ASX 's environmental footprint is small and mainly comprises the consumption of electricity at its offices , particularly the Australian Liquidity Centre . Due to the investments we have made in significant power backup and failover infrastructure we do not see this as a material risk at this stage . <p> Do you think the RBA will raise or lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have seen around the globe that lowering rates much further than current levels has proved to add little or been counterproductive . As such , in the near term , I see Australian rates moving sideways to higher . <p> Do you feel positive or negative about a Trump presidency and why ? <p> Certainty is good for business and at the moment it is hard to predict the direction of future US economic and foreign policy . I think the next 12 months will see increased volatility as the situation begins to unfold . Notwithstanding this , I generally feel positive about the prospects for ASX in Australia . <p> What are the challenges , if any , to increasing the percentage of female leadership at your firm ? What are the numbers and percentage of women who are direct reports to the CEO at your firm ? <p> We have seen increases in female leadership across the firm over the last 5 years . ASX continues to work towards its stated targets in this area and we have a range of initiatives in place to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and policies that support working families . A third of the members of ASX 's senior executive committee is female as are about 40 per cent of our managers and team leaders . We also have a strong pipeline of emerging female talent . <p> Mike Hirst , Bendigo and Adelaide Bank <p> How is the world of low returns impacting on your business and your decision making ? Are you more or less likely to invest overseas in 2017 ? <p> The absolute low level of interest rates reduces margin and revenue meaning there is a strong focus on cost management and growing market share at profitable prices both organically and through acquisition . Offshore investment is not a core strategy of the business . <p> Do you consider that China is a more or less an attractive market for your business as its growing middle class comes with questions about the economy 's debt buildup and rising political and regulatory risks ? <p> See above <p> How concerned are you about Australia losing its AAA credit rating ? What , in your opinion , are the implications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A credit rating is important for two reasons - it governs the price of debt borrowed and the amount of debt that can be borrowed . As Australia has always been a net borrower from overseas we need to have a rating that allows us to borrow the amount required to fund growth at a price that makes sense . In my view the AAA rating is preferable but not a necessity . After all , allocating investments is a relative game and there are not many AAA credits around , so it is questionable about how much of an imperative it is in my view . <p> Are you worried about the chaos and dysfunction in Canberra ? What policy reforms do you think should be prioritised in the interests of the nation in 2017 ? <p> I 'm more concerned that we end up with governments running agendas based on populism rather than developing a realistic vision for the future that the whole country can get behind . <p> What do business leaders need to do in response to the anti-business sentiment on both sides of politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business to the economy and society and then deliver on the obligation business has to feed into prosperity and not off it . <p> Are you more or less likely to invest in automation this year than last year ? If so what type of automation ? Also , what are the specific measures you are taking to digitise your business ? <p> Investment in continuous improvement is a not negotiable . In my industry that is driving digitalisation to reduce friction in the customer experience - making it easier for our customers to do business with us . <p> How much risk of power interruptions and cost increases do you assess for your business as baseload coal power generation is phased out and the electricity system becomes more reliant on renewables such as wind power ? <p> I expect government and industry to learn as we move down this path and get better at mitigating disruptions so I do n't have significant concerns about it being managed properly . <p> Do you think the RBA will raise or lower interest rates next year ? <p> Leave them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidency and why ? <p> I feel uncertain as I do n't know what he really stands for . <p> What are the challenges , if any , to increasing the percentage of female leadership at your firm ? What are the numbers and percentage of women who are direct reports to the CEO at your firm ? <p> 50 per cent of CEO direct reports are women . I think the greatest challenge is getting women to feel confident in their ability to take on promotions . <p> Andrew Mackenzie - BHP Billiton <p> How is the world of low returns impacting on your business and your decision making ? Are you more or less likely to invest overseas in 2017 ? <p> We saw the signs early and accelerated the restructure of the company to prepare for a world of lower margins.Over the past several years , the divestment of over US$7 billion of assets at attractive prices and successful demerger of South32 has reshaped our portfolio . We are now a simpler company and it has allowed us to focus on 12 core operated assets.Earlier this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's made our functions truly global and collaborative , and freed up our assets to focus on safety , volume and cost.BHP Billiton has the right assets in the right commodities with the capability and culture to prosper . Next year we have two major investment options , one in oil ( Mad Dog 2 project ) in the Gulf of Mexico and the second in copper ( Spence Growth Option ) in Chile . In Australia we will further study key investment options which include the South Flank iron ore mine in Western Australia , a staged expansion of Olympic Dam in South Australia and a debottlenecking project at our Caval Ridge metallurgical coal mine in Queensland . This is on top of over US$40 billion we invested in Australia over the past decade . <p> Do you consider that China is a more or less an attractive market for your business as its growing middle class comes with questions about the economy 's debt buildup and rising political and regulatory risks ? <p> We are confident China 's longer term outlook for commodities demand remains strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer size of its economy will underpin demand fundamentals well into the future.The Chinese government has an extensive agenda of reform to rebalance China 's economy and transition from investment to consumption led growth . They have also set bold national goals for trade corridors , climate change action and innovation and technology to further growth.The evolution of the Chinese economy is broadly going to plan . The central government debt in China is at 20 per cent of GDP . That is very modest by global standards . As the central government 's own balance sheet evolves the sorts of levers they choose will evolve as their economy transitions.China is more than a destination for our commodities . We work together with our Chinese partners to address the challenges faced by our industry and our countries . This year we partnered with Peking University in China to study the technology , economy and policy for carbon capture , use and storage for steel production . <p> How concerned are you about Australia losing its AAA credit rating ? What , in your opinion , are the implications for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with the Government 's efforts to address the deficit . If we are to improve Australia 's competitiveness then we must get the fiscal settings right . As we return to more balanced commodity markets , there is widespread agreement that productivity and competitiveness are essential . The onus is on us to work smarter , be innovative and stay competitive . It is also on the government to make change so business can be productive and adapt to the changing world . <p> Are you worried about the chaos and dysfunction in Canberra ? What policy reforms do you think should be prioritised in the interests of the nation in 2017 ? <p> There are a number of public policy areas that are critical to the future development of the Australian economy : trade , tax , workplace relations and regulatory efficiency . These go to the heart of Australia 's future economic success . Although more remains to be done across these areas , we agree with the Government 's reform agenda and we believe there is a high degree of consensus across the political spectrum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of great concern . The WA Nationals ' proposal to increase taxes on iron ore producers , which would destroy jobs and undermine investment confidence in WA -- is one example.The power issues in South Australia demonstrate that energy security should also be at the top of the national agenda . The market needs to supply affordable and reliable energy to households and businesses while seeking to reduce emissions.We will work with State and Federal Governments to improve Australia 's competitiveness and make sure we are well placed to attract investment and the jobs and economic growth that goes with it . <p> What do business leaders need to do in response to the anti-business sentiment on both sides of politics and in the broader community ? <p> We have a strong focus to improve community awareness of the contribution the industry makes to society . We will do more to demonstrate the benefits of a strong and healthy business sector in terms of jobs , economic development and social investment.Business must engage with politicians to make sure policy makers have the facts about the industry 's contribution and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Are you more or less likely to invest in automation this year than last year ? If so what type of automation ? Also , what are the specific measures you are taking to digitise your business ? <p> Our investment in automation will increase . We see technology , and specifically automation , as key to meeting our safety , volume and cost targets.A large focus of automation will optimise logistics , production and maintenance processes . We are working to automate fixed and mobile plants and process control and improve our equipment performance through smart and predictive maintenance.Autonomous drills will be rolled out at all sites in our Western Australian iron ore business . We will also expand our Autonomous Haul Truck Fleet at Jimblebar to other sites and increase the current fleet numbers.There has been much success using drones for specific safety and planning purposes such as making sure a blast site is clear of people and equipment.We see digitalisation is a key component to connect our people across time zones , cultural divides and bring people closer together in ' virtual teams ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Operation Technology environments to leverage data and analytics .

But Buttigieg , who is leading in polls in both New Hampshire and Iowa , did n't appear to have any missteps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make up ground in South Carolina , where he is struggling to connect with African American voters , but Wednesday was a start . <p> The question , though , was directed at Sen. Kamala Harris of California . She had criticized him earlier in the week , especially for the use of a stock photo from Kenya . The moderators asked her about that criticism , essentially giving her a chance to target Buttigieg . <p> She said Democratic candidates only show up to black communities when it 's election time . <p> "" The larger issue is that for too long I think candidates have taken for granted constituencies that have been the backbone of the Democratic party . "" <p> Her decision allowed Buttigieg to reach out to voters of color without having to confront one of only two black candidates on the stage . <p> He said he completely agrees with her and he welcomes the opportunity of connecting to black voters . <p> "" As mayor of a city that is racially diverse and largely low-income , "" he said , "" for eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a community where far too many people live with the consequences of racial inequity that has built up over centuries . <p> "" While I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin , I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country -- turning on the news and seeing my own rights come up for debate . "" <p> He was careful not to overly compare being openly gay with horrific racial injustices suffered by African Americans for centuries . But he still made his point that he understands what it 's like to face discrimination . <p> "" Two elections ago I would n't be on this stage wearing this wedding ring , "" he said . "" I have n't been judged on my skin color , and I 'll never know what that 's like . However , I do know what it 's like to be discriminated against when my rights have been put up for debate . "" <h> Booker did take a passing shot at Buttigieg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so quickly . <p> "" Nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters , "" he said after Buttigieg 's answer on race . <p> "" I have a lot of experience with black voters , "" Booker said . "" I 've been one since I was 18 . "" <p> "" First of all , I have made very clear that I think Pete is qualified to be on this stage , "" she said , "" and I am honored to be standing here next to him . "" <p> But she said women are held to a higher standard . As proof , she pointed out no woman has ever been president or vice president . <p> "" We have to work harder , "" she said , "" and that 's a fact . "" <p> She took a different tactic in the closing minutes of the debate . <p> Buttigieg was answering a seemingly simple question about his support for voting rights , mentioning legislation he liked in Congress . <p> Klobuchar broke in to indicate that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an example of what she was talking about when she said women had to work harder . She said she has experience actually voting on and passing those bills . And she said experience matters . <p> "" He said the right words , "" she said , "" but I have the experience . "" <p> Buttigieg had a quick answer -- and one that might show the hesitancy others have shown in tangling with him . <p> "" Washington experience is not the only experience that matters , "" he said . "" There is over 100 years of Washington experience on this stage , and where are we right now as a country ? I have the experience of bringing people together to get something done . "" <p> Klobuchar did n't press further . <p> Moments later , though , Gabbard went after him , accusing him of saying he would send U.S. troops to Mexico to fight drug cartels . <p> Buttigieg had an answer for her , too . <p> "" I know that it 's par for the course in Washington to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by today 's standards , "" he said . <p> Buttigieg said the United States and Mexico have been cooperating for years to fight drug cartels . <p> "" Do you seriously think anyone on this stage is talking about invading Mexico ? "" he asked . <p> He then criticized her for meeting with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad , whom he called a murderous dictator . <p> He even pivoted to Trump . Buttigieg said the president won by carrying much of the Midwest and indicated a Midwesterner might be able to change that in 2020 . <p> "" I do n't talk a big game about helping the working class while helicoptering between golf courses with my name of them , "" Buttigieg said . "" I do n't even golf . "" <p> He continued by appealing to the everyman . <p> "" I am literally the least wealthy person on this stage , "" Buttigieg said . "" I never thought I 'd be on a Forbes magazine list , until this year when they ranked presidential candidates by wealth . I came in dead last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a veteran . <p> "" I also wore the uniform of this country and know what 's at stake in decisions made in the Oval Office and Situation Room "" <h> Buttigieg gets into farming question <p> Buttigieg just about lit up when asked about subsidies the government is paying to farmers as the trade war with China continues . <p> This question was in his Midwestern wheelhouse . <p> "" We should n't have to pay farmers to take the edge off a trade war that should n't have started in the first place , "" he said . <p> He said the subsidies are not even making farmers whole , pointing in particular to those who plant soybeans and those who deal in ethanol . He said many rural Americans he talks to are worried things are not going to turn around under Trump . <p> "" I do n't think this president cares one bit about farmers , "" Buttigieg said . "" He keeps asking them to take one for the team , but more and more , I 'm talking to people in rural America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business as usual under this president . "" <p> Buttigieg went on to say that monopolies and consolidation are killing farmers , saying there are fewer places that sell supplies and fewer places to buy their crops . <p> He also pivoted to climate change , saying many rural Americans are ready for things like soil conservation . <h> He went after Trump , but not how it was teed up for him <p> Buttigieg said he thinks Trump should be held accountable for abuse of power , but he also said he thinks any other president would have resigned by now over a situation garnering less attention . <p> The mayor referenced a court case in which a judge ordered Trump to pay $2 million to various nonprofit groups to settle allegations that he and his family used Trump 's charitable foundation to further his political and business interests . The case was a civil matter , not criminal . <p> "" Under normal circumstances a president would leave office after something that was revealed recently that barely got any attention at all , which was the president had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverting charitable contributions that were supposed to go to veterans . "" <p> Buttigieg said the next president will have to unify the country and tackle issues such as health care , the economy and school shootings . <p> "" We are going to have to unify a nation that will be as divided as ever , "" Buttigieg said , "" and while doing it address big issues that did n't take a vacation for the impeachment process or for the Trump presidency as a whole . "" <p> He later went after Trump on military spending , delivering a memorable line . <p> Buttigieg said he would spend more in artificial intelligence , saying the United States is being outspent by rivals . <p> "" We do not have a 21st century strategy coming from this president , "" he said . "" After all , he 's relying on 17th century security technologies like a moat full of alligators or a"
"<h> Special blend of circuits and memristive devices created for brain-mimicking processing systems <p> Like any recipe , an ideal memristive neuromorphic computing system requires a special blend of CMOS circuits and memristive devices , as well as spatial resources and temporal dynamics that must be well matched to the system 's signal-processing applications and use cases .

"<h> ? 500m Future Fund launch mired by fears startups will miss out <p> Future Fund , the government 's ? 500m answer to startups ' need for cash to survive coronavirus , is set to launch today -- but risks freezing out a swathe of British firms , entrepreneurs and investors have warned . <p> But while take-up is expected to be high , critics fear the terms favour investment from venture capital funds and freeze out private investors who play a crucial role within the investment landscape . <p> The fund is also incompatible with the Enterprise Investment Scheme ( EIS ) and the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme ( SEIS ) , which offer tax breaks to early-stage investors . <p> As such , a large number of British startups may receive little to no help from the government during the coronavirus pandemic , sources told City A.M. <h> Venture capitalists will be ' over the moon ' <p> The Future Fund was launched to support the UK 's startups sector . However , critics of the Future Fund have said it only caters to venture capital funds , only one part of the overall investment landscape . <p> The headline terms are structured along the lines of a normal VC-type term sheet , Glafkos Tombolis , partner at tech law firm Kemp Little , tells City A.M. "" The government has obviously taken the advice of City law firms that focus on VCs . "" <p> Unlike CBILS and other government support schemes that resemble state aid , Tombolis thinks it has been structured more like a commercial arrangement . This , he said , "" is not the right approach "" . <p> And , given VC funds tend to have more cash at their disposal than the average early stage investor , the Future Fund merely reduces VCs ' risk . <p> "" The Future Fund is going to probably be used by a core number of VCs that will most likely invest into their existing companies , "" Stephen Page , co-founder and chief executive of seed investor Startup Funding Club , tells City A.M. "" It means they can reduce their risk . The VCs are over the moon . "" <p> Additionally critics worry that VCs who do use the fund to support new investments will push startups to accept onerous terms . Page says the VCs will have the power to implement the terms because startups will be desperate . <p> Adam Dodds , founder and chief executive of stock investing app Freetrade , said : "" The programme seems designed to support venture capitalists and will give them ample opportunity to take advantage of startups in desperate need of funding . "" <h> Future Fund will not be EIS-compliant <p> The convertible loan note structure of the fund means it is not ( S ) EIS eligible . <p> EIS is a form of tax relief to encourage investment into startups and early-stage businesses . It allows startups to raise up to ? 5m a year , capped at ? 12m overall , through private investors who receive tax breaks . SEIS , being seed funding , has a lower ceiling of ? 150,000 . <p> Therefore the majority of startups , which are powered by EIS funding , will not be successful in securing matched funding from investors or venture capital trusts ( VCTs ) . <p> Most startup funding in the UK comes from angels , private investors and family offices . But the reluctance to make the fund EIS-compliant means VCs are better-placed to co-invest . <p> "" EIS relief is critical for angel investors , "" Tombolis says . "" Angel investors take a measured approach in that they know a large proportion of investments will fail , and they 're banking on 10 per cent becoming successful . "" <p> Without the tax relief , investors will be unlikely to put money in alongside the government , risking the future of British startups particularly badly hit by the coronavirus crisis . <p> While overlooking the role of EIS , the government has also not announced any additional support for the scheme , says Bruce Macfarlane , managing partner of VC fund MMC Ventures . <p> "" Understandably , high levels of uncertainty have meant flows of capital into EIS have fallen sharply and as a result , investment for the UK 's early stage companies , "" he adds . <h> British startups with US backers will be ineligible for the Future Fund <p> Some of Britain 's brightest startups also face being locked out of the Future Fund because they do not have UK parent companies . <p> All UK startups that participated in US accelerator programmes , and therefore have a US parent company , will be excluded from the fund . <p> A requirement of such accelerator programmes is that the startup creates a US parent company . It has usually not been an issue , with companies using a UK subsidiary to support employees . However , the Future Fund 's terms state a company must have a UK parent company to be eligible for government support . <p> These startups have returned to the UK from the US , having secured funding and expertise in their fields , but are now excluded from both governments ' support packages . <p> Last week , a group of more than 30 chief executives wrote to the Treasury asking for a revision of the terms . Kieran O'Neill , a signatory and chief executive of men 's styling service Thread , tells City A.M. that the Future Fund , as it stands , "" will be missing out some of the most innovative and fastest-growing startups "" . <p> "" Many of them are biotech and artificial intelligence startups , which this government has said they will be working hard specifically to support , "" he adds . <h> More tax relief for investors could help startups <p> So what next for British startups unable to access CBILS and the Future Fund ? <p> There have been calls to introduce a temporary increase in the tax relief available through EIS . Macfarlane suggests an increase from 30 to 50 per cent could "" help overcome investor caution and restore capital flows "" . <p> Rather than relying on debt , "" startups would be gaining equity investment "" , says Macfarlane . "" If we want to ensure the innovative UK technology sector continues to thrive after the crisis , it is more equity-based solutions that we need . "" <p> Page echoes this temporary relief , but also calls on an increase on the SEIS relief to seven per cent . Otherwise , he argues , it risks a similar situation with the Future Fund where those being scaled up benefit . <p> Page , whose company Startup Funding Club provides early investment for British startups , has also suggested a second Future Fund to support startups . <p> He explains there is a distinct difference between startups and scale-ups , which is what VCs focus on . As such , a second Future Fund "" should be tax relief-centric so it is matching people like us and other funds and angels "" ."

"<h> Artificially Intelligent Energy Industry <p> The term ' Artificial Intelligence ' ( AI ) is a venture to replicate human intelligence in machines . In recent years , businesses across the globe are leveraging AI to optimize their process and reap higher revenues and profits . The energy sector is no exception . It has recognised the potential of AI , robotics , and machine learning ( ML ) . According to Mordor Intelligence research , the AI in the oil and gas market was valued at USD 2 billion in 2019 and is expected to reach USD 3.81 billion by 2025 , at a CAGR of 10.96% over the forecast period 2020 -- 2025 . <p> The collection and transmission of enormous data due to the Industrial Internet of Things ( IIoT ) have thrust upon analysing data to provide actionable insights that may be used to drive quick and accurate business decisions . Integrating AI in energy sub-sectors will enable managing operation , production and wastage efficiently . Further , this would eliminate the health and safety concerns giving way to implement decision-making and maintenance tasks from regional control centres . <h> Application of AI across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve deep-sea exploration of hydrocarbons , estimate rock density , porosity and formation , fluid resistance , well 's geothermal temperature profile , hole size and shape , etc . Robots have the potential to play improve safety and reduce costs on offshore platforms . The information collection would consume less time , have greater accuracy , and lower processing costs . <p> Power -- Smart grids are a way forward in the power sector . The humongous data collected at a grid is monitored to ensure supply meets demand . AI in electricity trading could help with the integration of renewables which would enhance accurate forecasts , grid stability , supply security as well as coordinate various participants in the Virtual Power Plant . It would have an added advantage of regulating greenhouse gas emissions due to thermal power plants . Data gathered from smart meters integrated with AI will help DISCOMs achieve their AT&amp;C loss targets . <p> Image Source : Disruptor Daily <p> Renewable -- Solar and wind power are heavily dependent on weather conditions . To harness their full potential , AI should be incorporated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to make smart storage management decisions . The combination of 3D printing and AI could improve the manufacturing of solar panels and wind turbines which are expensive and toxic to produce in conventional ways . <p> Coal -- With introduction of automation and AI in mining , job-related risks such as dust inhalation , auditory perception , chemical risks can be subjugated . As per PwC 's report on ' Artificial intelligence in India -- hype or reality ' , AI has helped operations in mining to get real-time alerts for detecting intrusions , identifying abandoned objects , evaluating traffic flow density and enabling facial and character recognition to improve overall safety and security levels at different locations . <h> Implementing AI across globe in energy sector <p> Royal Dutch Shell collaborated with Udacity to digitally train its workers in AI . The company recently launched virtual assistants , Emma and Ethan , to resolve lubricant-related queries of customers and distributors . ExxonMobil partnered with MIT to design AI robots for ocean exploration , aimed at improving its natural oil seep detection capabilities . <p> Schlumberger , Chevron and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaningful insights from multiple data sources . Gazprom Neft ( one of the largest suppliers of natural gas to Europe and Turkey ) collaborated with Yandex ( Russia 's Google ) to explore various potential artificial intelligence applications . <p> Total and Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ) are creating a digital innovation centre in India to improve industrial efficiency and energy performance . Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited ( HPCL ) is effectively using analytics for managing dashboards , reporting insights , making decisions , visualising data , and creating sales analytics . HPCL has also invested in an AI-based startup Tranzmeo . Wipro 's AI platform , Wipro Holmes , has assisted leading LNG company in gaining operational and business insight . <p> Image Source : Energy World <p> According to Accenture 's report on ' Accelerating India 's Economic Growth with Artificial Intelligence ' , AI has the potential to add US$957 billion to India 's economy in 2035 .

With a massive change in skill requirements , professionals might lose their jobs if they do n't stay updated . Also , automation and robotics are energy-intensive . Hence it is important to develop energy-efficient data centres with less/no carbon footprint . <p> Further , AI is as intelligent as its data . Capturing better data about operations is the first step in getting better answers . It is important to protect and secure the data from cyberattacks . Any information about past cyber-attacks could contribute to building a smarter data centre . <p> We need to be careful so that we may not end up defeating the purpose of inculcating AI in energy .

"<h> Microsoft advocates for data classification policy in Nigeria <p> Microsoft advocates for data classification policy in Nigeria -- Digital technology is redefining the way people live , destroying real and imagined fetters . With the rise of artificial intelligence ( AI ) , augmented reality ( AR ) , internet of things ( IoT ) and others in information communication , comes the era of big data . Microsoft Nigeria General Manager Mr. Akin Banuso says there is need for Nigeria to have a data classification policy . He spoke with LUCAS AJANAKU on the sideline at the inauguration of Tek Experts office in Lagos . <p> How is Microsoft partnering the Federal Government to realise its goals in the information communication technology ( ICT ) space ? <p> We have a number of initiatives . We are talking not just with the Federal Government , but also the state government . But your question is specific about the Federal Government . In terms of the Federal Government , we signed an MoU back in December with the National Information Technology Development Agency ( NITDA ) the IT development agency . One of the things we are looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data classification policies , we should have a cloud policy , which is very clear and helps us determine how we stop , use , disseminate and protect data . <p> Data is critical but it needs to be accessible , otherwise it is useless . Data is powerful and useful , so there lot of the things that we are doing . We are working with various agencies of government to look at how we can do digital transformation . So , you can imagine in education or in ministries where if you went somewhere you wanted to search for records . In record management , we should be able to digitally search for records , we should be able to reference things that we need . Data is the new currency , knowledge is also the new currency , but without data , knowledge is not possible . So , we are doing a lot of the things now ; you will see that we are announcing a lot of training , a lot of educational programmes and basic education up to tertiary level . We are supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space . <p> How is Microsoft Nigeria involved with Tek Expert ? <p> Tech Expert is a global partner ; it is a global services and support organisation . So , the global services and support organisation is the team that sort of empowers and helps us to empower our customers whenever they run into a technical issue or they need help . They sort of help in getting the best value out of our products ; so it 's an after sales support . We have a global partnership with Tek Experts and when our global team decided that they wanted to expand the capacity , we already have 27,000 people providing this support globally . When we decided that we wanted to expand this support , one of the things that we looked at was in accordance to our mission . <p> Our mission statement at Microsoft is to empower every person and every organisation on the planet to achieve more , as part of its objectives and mission . We should expand the reach of our support services into other locations where we do n't currently have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in the United States , we have people in South America so we thought we should also give the opportunity to Africa . We spoke with Tek Experts and told them that we want to expand , we want to look at new locations and jointly we started to evaluate Africa . We looked at couple of locations and in the end through the process , it was agreed that the first location that we will do in Africa will be Nigeria , purely because Nigeria has this wonderful depth of talented resources that are very dynamic and forward looking . <p> Tek Expert said its model is that it provides support from multinational companies . We in effect , are what you will call their anchor tenants for coming into Nigeria . You could look at it that way . We are working together to come and explore , open up the Nigeria market , which we believe very strongly is right for this kind of service . <p> In specific terms , how will this deepen the IT ecosystem in Nigeria ? <p> This is phenomenal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deepen the ecosystem . The fact that we are putting this world class facility in place is significant . The internet protocol ( IP ) , the training Microsoft brings and the skill development that Tek Expert are going to provide for this young people is phenomenal . I mean that when they come out of this environment and we 've seen this everywhere else , we 've gone into it with Tek Expert , the entire ecosystem grows . This is because now you will have a number of skilled people , who are used to supporting our customers globally ; who can come out and set up their own companies because they have the talent . This same people can go into other companies in Nigeria and leverage our new technology . <p> So , as they become skilled in the new skills that are relevant for the knowledge age , they are able to provide better solutions . They would form their own status based on the knowledge that they have to solve the problems that we 're facing in Nigeria . So , you can imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( FBI ) or the United States Navy in solving deep problems when they come out of this environment and they face our local problems . They already have the feel and then the experience to be able to now apply that knowledge and say : we could do it this way . So , this would have a multiplier effect for our economy and then the normal things . <p> Just between January and now when they started , they said they have hired 300 people and this is only for Microsoft . And for other people coming , there will even be much deeper skills and then you imagine what that does to the economy . Each person hired , the multiplier effect and then as they go on and grow , they add more people . We have even more people joining the work force and then more competent people coming out into the society to help us grow . <p> How to Make money Selling post utme past question -- Nairabookstore is an online academic and book interface between authors , publishers , researchers and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to both authors and readers ..."
"<h> Trending Now <h> GM joins other carmakers investing in self-driving startup Nauto <p> ( July 19 ) : General Motors Co and Japan 's Softbank Group Corp are among the latest investors in Nauto , a Silicon Valley startup developing software for self-driving vehicles . <p> Nauto , based in Palo Alto , said on Tuesday it closed a US$159 million Series B funding round , led by Softbank and venture capital firm Greylock Partners . Previous investors included German automaker BMW AG and Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp , as well as German insurance firm Allianz . <p> Nauto is unusual in attracting money from big-name automakers , and also in its focus on software and data , which cost less to develop than hardware or entire vehicles . <p> "" Any ( vehicle ) manufacturer is better than any startup at building cars , "" said Stefan Heck , founder and chief executive officer of two-year-old Nauto .

The goal is to gather data on driver distraction and on the environment around vehicles and speed development of self-driving technology . <p> Using such techniques as computer vision and deep learning , a form of artificial intelligence , the company is analyzing video feeds and data from the retrofit devices to improve driver performance and safety . Learning more about how humans drivers behave is critical , Heck said , because self-driving cars must share the roads with those vehicles for at least the next 20 to 30 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autonomous vehicles that are not just smart , but are able to collaborate with humans , "" Heck said in an interview . <p> Nauto is working with investors and other companies "" to learn from human drivers , the best and the worst , to inform "" the development of self-driving vehicles . <p> Heck declined to say how many vehicles are using Nauto 's cameras and software , but said the company expects to accumulate more than one billion miles of real-world data within the next year ."

"<h> ' AI spots more offensive photos than humans on Facebook ' <p> -- By PTI Jun 01 , 2016 05:02 pm <p> Washington : In an attempt to combat hate speech , Facebook has said its artificial intelligence ( AI ) systems now report more offensive photos than humans do , which can help remove such content before it hurts the sentiments of people . When users upload something offensive to disturb people , it normally has to be seen and flagged by at least one person . <p> Offensive posts include content that is hate speech , threatening or pornographic ; incites violence ; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence . For example , a bully , jilted ex-lover , stalker , terrorist or troll could post offensive photos to someone 's wall , a group , event or the feed , ' Tech Crunch ' reported . <p> By the time the content is flagged as offensive and taken down by Facebook , it may have already caused the damage . <p> Now , AI is helping Facebook to unlock active moderation at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees it . <p> "" Today we have more offensive photos being reported by AI algorithms than by people , "" said Joaquin Candela , Facebook 's Director of Engineering for Applied Machine Learning . As many as 25 per cent of engineers now regularly use its internal AI platform to build features and do business , Facebook said . <p> This AI helps rank news feed stories , read aloud the content of photos to the vision impaired and automatically write closed captions for video ads that increase view time by 12 per cent . AI could eventually help social networking sites combat hate speech . Facebook , along with Twitter , YouTube and Microsoft yesterday agreed to new hate speech rules ."

"<p> "" WhatsApp has highlighted its work on filtering fake news , banning spammers , and training industries on how to identify threats and propaganda "" <p> As privacy questions rise steadily on the internet and the problem of fake news steadily murks up the waters , the world 's most popular messaging app , WhatsApp , has released a whitepaper detailing its plight against fake news , and how it fights against spammers , spreaders of propaganda and hate speech , and other users with such malicious content . In a paper titled ' Stopping Abuse : How WhatsApp fights bulk messaging and automated behaviour ' , the company details its apparent efforts behind trying to keep the platform away from vices . <p> In the paper , the company states , "" WhatsApp takes a multi-pronged approach to this challenge while also working to maintain the private nature of our service . We have built sophisticated machine learning systems to detect abusive behaviour and ban suspicious accounts at registration , during messaging , and in response to user reports . We remove over two million accounts per month for bulk or automated behaviour -- over 75 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important during elections where certain groups may attempt to send messages at scale . "" <p> The figure of banning over two million spam accounts per month is quite a drastic one , seeing that the platform reports an overall installed base of 1.5 billion monthly active users ( MAUs ) . The company describes its machine learning algorithms at the epicentre of its fight against bulk messaging accounts and fake news propagation , further stating , "" We want to increase the speed of these systems by ensuring they can get real-time labels of abusive accounts they have missed and good accounts they incorrectly identified as abusive . This will help our machine learning models adapt and respond immediately to any new kind of abuse . The more we can increase the cost for those who attempt to abuse our platform , the less they will succeed . "" <p> These measures come to play just at the onset of India 's national elections . With the fate of the country 's governance up for judgement , messaging services such as WhatsApp , and fellow vernacular platforms such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against opposition , bulk-spread fake news in a bid to change minds and/or build hate , and other such actions . On this note , WhatsApp states that it has been making "" significant product changes "" to streamline its platform . <p> These changes include a nationwide television advertisement campaign to spread word on fake news circulated in groups and the consequences of it , closer group administrator control , and adding a ' forwarded ' label as a fair warning of content originality . Apart from these , WhatsApp also limited message forwarding facility and instituted a wider grievance reporting system that helps people inform about misbehaving users . It also aims to strike ground by teaching user groups such as political parties about the responsibility of using the platform , although the effects of that may not be the most profound . <p> With the national elections around the corner , WhatsApp 's whitepaper is further aimed at spreading awareness against the misuse of the power of communication , which has been a highly contentious factor across the world . <p> A lover of anything that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology , science and journalism in equal parts .

"<p> The promise of artificial intelligence , advanced sensors , and self-driving cars could be achieved without full autonomy , argue scholars with deep expertise in automation and technology <p> If you follow technology news -- or even if you do n't -- you have probably heard that numerous companies have been trying to develop driverless cars for a decade or more . These fully automated vehicles could potentially be safer than regular cars , and might add various efficiencies to our roads , like smoother-flowing traffic . <p> Or so it is often claimed . But the promise of artificial intelligence , advanced sensors , and self-driving cars could be achieved without full autonomy , argue scholars with deep expertise in automation and technology -- including David Mindell , an MIT professor and author of a new book on the subject . <p> If robotics in extreme environments are any guide , Mindell says , self-driving cars should not be fully self-driving . That idea , he notes , is belied by decades of examples involving spacecraft , underwater exploration , air travel , and more . In each of those spheres , fully automated vehicles have frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a driver or pilot somewhere in the network . This is one reason Mindell thinks cars are not on the road to complete automation . <p> "" That 's just proven to be a loser of an approach in a lot of other domains , "" Mindell says . "" I 'm not arguing this from first principles . There are 40 years ' worth of examples . "" <p> Now Mindell , the Frances and David Dibner professor of the History of Engineering and Manufacturing in MIT 's Program in Science , Technology , and Society , and also a professor in MIT 's Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics , has detailed the history in his new book , ' Our Robots , Ourselves ' . <p> To be clear , Mindell thinks that "" it 's reasonable to hope "" that technology will help cars "" reduce the workload "" of drivers in incremental ways in the future . But total automation , he thinks , is not the logical endpoint of vehicle development . <p> "" The book is about a different idea of progress , "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in robotics leads to full autonomy . That may be a valuable idea to guide research ... but when automated and autonomous systems get into the real world , that 's not the direction they head . We need to rethink the notion of progress , not as progress toward full autonomy , but as progress towards trusted , transparent , reliable , safe autonomy that is fully interactive : the car does what I want it to do , and only when I want it to do it . "" <h> Shooting for the ' perfect 5 ' <p> To see why Mindell thinks history shows us that automation is not the endpoint of vehicular development , consider the case of undersea exploration . For decades , engineers and scientists thought that fully automated submersibles would be a step forward from the seemingly risky work of deep-sea journeys . <p> Instead , something unexpected happened with submersibles : Technological progress , including improved communications technologies , made it less useful to have fully automated vehicles sweeping across the sea floor . Instead , Mindell notes , submersibles "" are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with people monitoring and controlling them . <p> Or consider the Apollo program , which put US astronauts on the moon six different times . Originally , Mindell notes , the expectation was that moon missions would be fully automated , with astronauts nothing more than passengers . But in the end -- and partly due to the feedback of the astronauts themselves -- astronauts handled many critical functions , including the moon landings . <p> "" The sophistication of the computer and the software was used not to push people out , but to give them true control over the landing , "" Mindell says . <p> And then there are airplanes . Commercial airliners do have many automated systems , such as cruise control-type features and even systems that can automate landings in certain circumstances . But it still takes highly trained pilots to manage those systems , make critical decisions in the cockpit -- and , yes , frequently to steer the planes . <p> "" Commercial aviation is incredibly safe , "" says Mindell , himself a qualified civil aviation pilot with more than 1,000 hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason is there are a lot of highly technical systems , but those systems are all imperfect , and the people are the glue that hold the system together . Airline pilots are constantly making small corrections , picking up mistakes , correcting the air traffic controllers . "" <p> Drawing on a concept developed by MIT professor of mechanical engineering Tom Sheridan , Mindell notes that the level of automation in a project can be judged on a scale from 1 to 10 -- and aiming for 10 , he contends , does not necessarily lead to more success in any given endeavour , compared to a happy medium of technology and person . In the space program , Mindell reflects : "" The digital computer in Apollo allowed them to make a less automated spacecraft that was closer to the perfect 5 . "" <h> Full automation a ' 20th-century narrative ' <p> So why , in the case of cars , are we back to a point where many people are envisioning a driverless future ? In a way , Mindell says , this vision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the narrative of full autonomy is a 20th-century narrative , "" Mindell says . "" It 's a narrative of industrial mechanisation that 's kind of filtered its way through the 20th century , supported by 20th-century science fiction . These narratives can and should change . "" <p> Still , the idea of total automation is the approach taken by Google , most notably , in its development of self-driving cars . Yet as Mindell also observes , there are many challenges to the Google model : its cars must identify all nearby objects correctly , need perfectly updated mapping systems , and must avoid all software glitches . <p> Ultimately , Mindell writes : "" Google 's utopian autonomy is a more brittle , less functional solution than a rich , human-centered automation . "" He predicts that the fully driverless model will not be the most successful , both for technical and social reasons . <p> "" The notion of ceding control of something as fundamental to life as driving to a big , opaque corporation -- people are not comfortable with that , "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at automating cars are "" very clearly not going for the Google approach to fully driverless cars "" . <p> Mindell says he is eager to see how technologists , especially robotics engineers , react to the book . Among the places where Mindell is scheduled to speak on his current book tour are Microsoft and , yes , Google . In time , Mindell says , he believes his perspective will come to be more widely accepted , and that full automation on the roads will not seem as desirable a goal . <p> "" I think the public discourse is slowly coming around to there is another way to do it , "" Mindell concludes . <p> If you follow technology news -- or even if you do n't -- you have probably heard that numerous companies have been trying to develop driverless cars for a decade or more .

"<h> Robot rides slow down but keep moving <p> Intel Capital "" My greatest fear is that we will hit the winter of AV ( autonomous vehicles ) , "" says Jill Sciarappo in response to an unwelcome question at the Intel Capital conference in Arizona -- the US state that saw the first self-driving car death last year . <p> Sciarappo is the marketing director of Intel-owned Mobileye , one of the main companies in the autonomous vehicle market , and she was sat alongside the CEO of trade organization the Arizona Commerce Authority ( ACA ) Sandra Watson , and professor from Dr Sethuraman Panchanathan from the Arizona State University ( ASU ) , at the Biltmore Hotel in Arizona just a few miles from the fateful crash . <p> Together they are representing the new "" Institute for Automated Mobility "" which was set up in October last year and represents Arizona 's response to the death of Elaine Herzberg , although no one is willing to say so publicly . <p> The institute combines business with government and academia but Watson -- a government figure who oversees it -- makes no bones about the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry . It was "" set up to accommodate industry as much as possible , "" she noted and repeatedly referred to the Arizona governor 's business background and desire to use his position to help corporates . <p> Just in case you 're in any doubt as to its approach , the main webpage for the institute notes at the top that "" 94 per cent of serious vehicle crashes are due to human error . "" <p> All of which is important and relevant because Arizona remains the main testing ground for autonomous vehicles in the US and by extension the world . That 's down to three factors : first , Arizona is flat , its roads are straight , and new , and well marked , and the climate is dry and sunny . It 's the perfect test-bed for getting machines to learn how to drive cars . <p> Second , Arizona 's governor has championed the industry and gone out of his way to make Arizona a good place for AV companies to set up shop , even pushing and passing legislation to accommodate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of technological advances and research on autonomous cars ; it 's where the money and the engineers are . <h> Do n't say nuffin <p> Which is why no one wants to talk about Elaine Herzberg and her death at Uber 's hands . After a lengthy presentation about what the new institute will do and how it will do it ( short version : test beds , tech specs , industry best practices ) , no one had mentioned the death that still casts a shadow over the self-driving dream , leaving it this reporter to raise the issue and make everyone uncomfortable . <p> The governor had gone out of his way to publicly invite Uber to Arizona after the company 's self-driving program was kicked out of San Francisco for failing to even apply for licenses . Uber came , and then it ran down a citizen and killed her , and the governor was forced to disinvite the company and pray that anger over the issue would n't become a political problem for him . <p> So we ask what lessons have been learnt from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her notes and informs us that the Arizona state government 's "" focus was always on safety , "" and that she ca n't comment further because the state is still involved in litigation over the matter . <p> Academic Dr Panchanathan pivots to talk about how Arizona is a great place for testing autonomous driving thanks to having "" lots of sunshine but also snow as well as mountains "" along with a "" focus on safety . "" And Sciarappo -- as the industry voice on the panel -- notes that "" it is incumbent on all of us to always be safe . "" <p> But , to Sciarappo 's credit , she does address the issue , albeit in a roundabout way . She refers to artificial intelligence and how it was the big exciting industry not so long ago but after it did n't meet initial expectations , interest plummeted and the industry entered the "" winter of AI . "" <p> Issues around safety and autonomous cars -- especially when a pedestrian is mown down during testing -- pose the same risk and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own "" winter . "" <p> It 's clear that the new institute is supposed to insulate the AV industry -- and the governor -- from possible blowback but such is the sensitivity that no one will talk about it , or Uber , or Ms Herzberg . Which is a shame . <h> Revving up <p> But while the self-driving industry may have taken its foot off the accelerator -- with a new self-driving taxi service in Phoenix slowly and carefully launching - it has most definitely not stopped moving and it may soon speed up again . <p> Earlier in the day we spoke in some depth with another AV company , Aeye , which designs the self-driving systems that combine radar and cameras to give cars their own machine visibility and intelligence and so help move toward full autonomy . <p> Last year at the same event Aeye was confidently predicting that everyone in the industry would soon move to an integrated system of both cameras and lidar in order to make progress . At the time , some were arguing that only cameras were needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong focus on an overall system . <p> Aeye 's prediction has turned out to be right -- and arguments in the other direction may have led to the Uber death for which it was eventually found not to be criminally negligent - which makes its predictions this year all the more relevant . Blair LaCorte from Aeye argues that the past year of the industry has been messy and scrappy but that it has started settling on a basic structure . <p> And that structure will be a market split in two : on the one side , companies that own the "" assets "" i.e. cars with autonomous car technology built in , and which aim to make money from them . On the other you 'll have service companies that will build and improve the AV technology itself . The days of one company doing both are over , he predicts . <p> He also predicts that the tech itself will largely split : between self-driving improvements or add-ons to existing cars ( ADAS or Adapted Drive Systems in the lingo ) that will do things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straying out of a lane ; and fully autonomous cars that will be owned and run by large companies for things like taxi services .

Car companies have decided that safety is going to sell . And that has given other companies more time to focus on the technology -- which has led to some significant advances . <p> Aeye has a pretty impressive demo where it shows you what , in real time , its autonomous car is seeing .

If you smell coffee , you look around for coffee ; if you hear something , you look toward it and assess it .

If you own a fleet of such cars that are pretty much able to go do their own thing , the current approach when the vast majority of cars are sat immobile most of the day starts becoming an enormous waste of resources . <p> "" How would we all change our habits if travel was readily available and almost free ?

Why Canada must block the road . <p> Finally , and written by one of the most best investigative journalists in Canada , who cuts through the entire Huawei nonsense , and clearly spells it out for all of us to see . <p> Huawei to Hell <p> Where China 's 5G giant wants to take us . Why Canada must block the road <p> Meng Wanzhou 's extradition hearing in Vancouver last week drew a crowd of protesters . Photo by Jonathan Hayward , the Canadian Press . <p> The extradition hearing for Huawei top executive Meng Wanzhou ( a.k.a . Sabrina Meng ) grabbed attention in Vancouver last week , with more to come in June . The case pops in and out of view . The details might seem irrelevant to those of us who do n't inhabit the tech biz stratosphere . <p> Your support for our ' public-powered journalism ' is proving it can work . <p> Just remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hopes to disarm Canadians with aggressive charm . Huawei 's story , the only one it wants Canadians to hear , is this unbelievable heartbreaker : <p> Sabrina Meng , Huawei 's trusted CFO and daughter of its billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei , was on her way to Mexico to champion 5G technology when she got unfairly arrested at the Vancouver airport . <p> Meng , a glorious global leader of the next phase of the internet revolution , is entirely innocent of fraud , as charged by the U.S. Justice Department . <p> Moreover , the company denies operating a shadow company in Iran that violated U.S. sanctions against that country . <p> In fact , Canadians should regard the whole Trumpian affair as "" contrary to the rule of law . "" <p> We also are to pity Meng , because she has been confined to one of her two multimillion-dollar Vancouver mansions and must wear a GPS bracelet along with her Jimmy Choo stilettos . How merciless ! <p> We are to forget that the Chinese Communist Party , in retaliation for the arrest of Meng @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They also turned a jail term for another Canadian into a death sentence . <p> We are told that Huawei considers these arrests to be unfortunate , but "" these are not issues for a tech company to get involved in , "" said Alykhan Velshi , Huawei 's Canadian VP of corporate affairs , to CBC 's the Current earlier this week . <p> The idea that Huawei operates like an arm of the Chinese government is silly , said Velshi . <p> Huawei Canada does its own thing . "" We have been operating in Canada for 10 years , "" he added . <p> Now comes the part of the story that wants us to accept that technological progress ca n't be stopped or challenged . <p> First , we are to believe that Huawei is just another company like Facebook and Google with nothing but purity in their corporate hearts and dedicated to the gods of convenience and efficiency . <p> Huawei does , after all , lead the globe in developing 5G technology , which will connect all digital devices and accelerate the progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say the Chinese , that 5G technology can serve as a Trojan horse for their totalitarian state to spy on Canadians . <p> If there happens to be a bug or a backdoor in the technology , well , "" there is a technological solution , "" because 5G technology is just a "" technology issue , "" said Velshi . <p> If Canada were to ban Huawei 's 5G technology and stand in the way of progress , Canadians would become "" laggards . "" Nobody wants to be a laggard . <p> Huawei would like you to know that it makes neutral technologies that connect and enrich people 's lives . <p> If that technology is used to help conduct surveillance on millions of Chinese Uighurs , Huawei is n't responsible for the application . <p> "" We sell technology all around the world , but we do n't operate it . We do n't know how our customers choose to operate it , "" Velshi explained to the Current . <p> Last but not least , Huawei is a nice company that sponsors Canadian hockey games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stop globalization by walling off Huawei and 5G technology . <p> Let 's expose these lies . <p> About 40 per cent of the world 's population is now enmeshed in cellular systems designed by Huawei . The company earns $108 billion a year and employs nearly 200,000 people . The Communist Party of China has 300 committees embedded in the company . <p> As a consequence , Huawei is not just another technology firm ( no such fiction exists anywhere ) but a manifestation of the imperial goals of the Chinese government , which is committed to winning a global war in artificial intelligence . <p> Every day the Chinese state already uses a variety of technologies , including systems made by Huawei that support facial recognition , to limit dissent and expand its Social Credit System . <p> The Social Credit System consists of constant state surveillance of people 's shopping , watching and even walking habits that creates a computational score . The Big Brother score allows the state to assess the trustworthiness of its citizens . With the help of an algorithm , the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the machinations of Facebook and Google have proven , no technology can be free of the encoded bias of its makers , let alone the tendency of technology to erode human freedom overtime . <p> Last year , the Australian Strategic Policy Institute deftly mapped out the political role that China 's tech companies play at home and abroad . <p> The Australian report , which Canadian politicians should read , spoke bluntly . "" China 's ambitions to influence the international development of technological norms and standards are openly acknowledged . "" <p> It added , "" The Chinese Communist Party recognises the threat posed by an open internet to its grip on power -- and , conversely , the opportunities that dominance over global cyberspace could offer by extending that control . "" <p> As such , Huawei has played a prominent role in making world a more insecure and totalitarian place . <p> The Australian report , for example , documents how Huawei has erected scores of so-called Smart City Public Security projects around the world . <p> "" Those projects -- which are often euphemistically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the provision of surveillance cameras , command and control centres , facial and licence plate recognition technologies , data labs , intelligence fusion capabilities and portable rapid deployment systems for use in emergencies . "" <p> Huawei announces its first 5G chip in Barcelona in February 2018 , paving the way for the company 's mobile devices to mesh with next generation of cellular networks . <p> The company has also been supplying video surveillance and analysis systems to the dictator of Belarus in Europe . And it has enabled the surveillance of millions of Uyghurs in Xinjiang province by providing security forces with technical support and training . <p> The real story takes another unhappy turn . <p> The Wall Street Journal recently documented how Huawei technicians that were embedded in the cybersecurity operations of two African states helped those government spy on their political critics . ( Huawei denies the charge . ) <p> Last year , the Financial Times described the growing global reach of China 's digital authoritarianism . <p> Chinese tech companies , among the largest and most innovative in the world , are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union ( ITU ) . <p> That means that China Telecom , TZE , Huawei and China 's surveillance camera giants are now setting global standards for the total surveillance of people in cities . In effect , the Chinese fox is now wiring parts of the global henhouse for happy surveillance . <p> Given these unsettling developments , Huawei 's claim to be a neutral player is absurd . Every company in China , whether private or state owned , serves the interests of the Communist Party . <p> In 2017 President Xi Jinping , a dictator in all but name , passed the National Intelligence Law . It does n't hide the state 's intentions . The law requires any company to co-operate with state intelligence work and to keep that work secret . The law makes every Chinese company operating abroad a potential Trojan horse . <p> Even long-time promoters of better Chinese-Canadian relations can see the writing on the wall . "" It would be folly to hand the keys to our national infrastructure to what is effectively a Chinese State Owned Enterprise , "" argues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ottawa . <p> Richard Fadden , former security advisor to the prime minister , goes further . "" If China would resort to putting Canadians to death to defend its corporate national champion , what might it do if the Chinese Communist Party had unfettered access to Canada 's vital communications networks ? "" <p> Last but not least comes the issue of 5G technology itself . <p> The issue is just not about the security of the system , but the tyrannical nature of the entire system itself . Whether engineered by Huawei or Nokia , 5G cinches the technological noose on every aspect of human life . <p> To date , each new development in cellular phone networks has offered a novelty along with increased security risks : 2G offered texting and spam ; 3G boosted speeds and introduced wireless threats ; 4G delivered streaming and created a "" dynamic threat landscape . "" <p> 5G , the equivalent of a colonial occupying force , requires the rollout of a massive infrastructure of wireless base stations , because it operates on wavelength frequencies that ca n't travel far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer researchers have repeatedly warned that "" new types of security threats and challenges will arise along with the deployment of novel 5G technologies and services , "" because 5G makes the whole system easier to hack . <p> Meanwhile , the political status quo fails to signal the need for caution . Instead , citizens are told we should welcome each new technology as a great liberator delivering us shiny conveniences and efficiencies . <p> But who feels liberated ? Successive waves of gadgets and their networks have eroded our freedom , abolished our privacy , undermined our democracies and blunted our spirits with algorithms designed to make people more predictable and docile . <p> James Bridle , a powerful critic of this state of affairs , argues that the uncritical belief in technology 's amoral utility "" perpetuates our inability to rethink our dealings with the world . "" <p> Such thinking weakens our resistance , but resistance is all that we have left . <p> What is clear is that Canada must follow Australia and New Zealand and ban Huawei from 5G infrastructure . <p> That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national office to assess all emerging technologies regardless of national origin and their threats to democracies . <p> China , which has no belief in freedom , has mastered a technology whose wind fills the sails of tyranny . <p> Huawei is just one of many interconnected high-tech firms trying to make the world a better place for machines and machine thinking . <p> The U.S. , a failing democracy destabilized by its technologies such as Facebook , has fallen behind in this new cold war . <p> It has no real strategy on how to retain its tentative grip on global communications other than trying to impede Huawei . <p> Wired reporter Garrett Graff argues the dispute "" could calve the world into two separate tech ecosystems , one in North America and parts of Europe and the other across Asia and the Southern Hemisphere . The former would be dominated by Nokia , Amazon , Google , Facebook , Microsoft , and Apple , and the latter by Huawei , Alibaba , Tencent , and Baidu .

The danger is "" existential to democracy "" when "" allowing totalitarian regimes -- or any government -- full knowledge of everything you do at all times , "" he said . <p> "" Because the tendency is always going to be to want to regulate how you think , how you act , what you do .

Others , not so much . <p> The two Canadians languishing in Chinese jails would likely be released in short order if Canada would deny the U.S. request to extradite Meng Whanzou , and release her from her house arrest . I do n't approve of U.S. sanctions against Iran , and therefore do n't care whether anyone violates said sanctions . <p> I consider this to be an entirely seperate issue from whether or not Canada adopts Huawei 's 5G technology . <p> The issue is just not about the security of the system , but the tyrannical nature of the entire system itself . Whether engineered by Huawei or Nokia , 5G cinches the technological noose on every aspect of human life . <p> ... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish a national office to assess all emerging technologies regardless of national origin and their threats to democracies . <p> In this story there are some nuggets despite some of the distrubing statements . At least here there is an acknowledgement that a problem exists around the technology itself and the apporach to technology . As well , there should be deep concerns about the nature of tech companies in general and it should not be limited to Huawei but include ocmpanies such as Google and Facebook which we have seen show a priority of making money wherever they can without concern for the ethics of principles of law . They hire ways of getting around the law and avoiding infomred consent . <p> The elephant in the room is that Huawei might be no better or worse than any other of these companies which is very bad indeed . Many of the legitimate concerns about Huawei are equally true about every other tech giant that maximizes profit in the world of big data . <p> As nations consider the Huawei participation the emphasis is on the Chinese nationality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the role of large for profit companies in setting priorities , and protection for people regardless of who creates the technology . this is an obvious mistake apart from concerns about the treatment of China it creates a false sense of security any time another company takes Huawei 's place . <p> As far as the issue of Huawei cooperating with the government of China . There may be cause to be concerned . A basis for this concern is in the behaviour of other companies : <p> It is important to note that companies asked to provide assistance to govenrment do not do so without the presumption of benefit . They do this without any public accountability and do it based on a moral stance informed by propaganda of whatever country their decision makers live in . Companies are a-moral actors and the decision makers in any of them tend not to be sophisticated in morals but rather technology innovators with a keen eye on profit . Some of the most critical moral decisions are made by these people . It is not difficult to have in these arena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lofty moral principles . <p> the article I linked to contains some serious quesitons and demonstrates a rather scary optimism about the US government agencies . If you bring that optimism back down to earth you can see many of the questions result in far darker answers . <p> It may be wise not to trust Huawei , but do n't make it about that company alone . Other companies based in other countries ( many in the US ) are euqally untrustworthy and equally willing to sell out people to whomever is able to give them a worthwhile benefit . <p> Questions could be asked baout having this technology in private hands at all . The problem is then who do you trust more ? Government or companies ? At least government is supposed to have your interest . Companies make no such pretence . The workings of the non-security parts of government may be easier to probe than private companies who claim just about anything as competatively sensitive . Any private company can deal with any government in its most shadowy sector . <p> The Huawei controversy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right ones . <p> We might start with another one : the technology this 5G system offers -- is this something we need and would benefit from or is it just another centre for profit at cost to most of the people ? <p> Left Turn and JKR are making statements here that are not in opposition to each other . Canada has no reason to want to enforce sactions on Iran , given that I do not believe that Canadians believe in them . Certainly the Canadian govenrment does not believe in them considering the fact that this country is awash in laundered money from the worst actors in this regime so why are we supporting penalties imposed on the entire Iranian population while supporting Revolutionary Guard laundering . Let 's be clear this smae issue also exists in other countries like the US who also profit from turning away at convenient times . The government of Canada betrayed the Iranian people by allowing the seizure and sale of Iranian public assets in Canada to pay Americans who had no legitimate claim on them -- At the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steal from the Iranian people . A pro Iranian people position would be to restrict the laundering and protect the long term public assets of the Iranian people . <p> Nobody is surveilled by a more powerful and comprehensive consortium than those of us under the Five Eyes umbrella . The mythology around Huawei 's ' back door ' is purely a propaganda construct designed to buttress the US side in an ongoing competition for the 5G market , utilizing the ever-ready Sinophobia , yellow-peril xenophobia as required to leverage global market-share advantage . Even BoJo and Perfidious Albion has the good sense to reject American pressure tactics to forego a superior technology . What we should be as interested in examining are the possible health implications of this further and significant addition to the electromagnetic spectrum ' saturation bombing ' . <p> Nobody is surveilled by a more powerful and comprehensive consortium than those of us under the Five Eyes umbrella .

Huawei might be subject to scrutiny from American politicians , but nevertheless holds the world 's largest number of verifiable 5G patents , leaving its competitors trailing . As of October last year it specified it had over 65 commercial 5G contracts worldwide , with roughly half based in Europe . Italy , Spain , Portugal , France and Ireland are amongst the countries who have embraced the Chinese firm , shrugging off US warnings against it , as well as attempts to stifle the company by blacklisting it from American markets ... "" <p> And how would this be a bad thing for Canadians ? Pulling out of 5Eyes is something to applaud not fear . Less integration with the US security regimes should be the goal . <p> I do n't think you understood my post . <p> My point is that we need to stand up to the US but the problem is that in so doing there will be short term economic consequences which brings the risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government wins then the standing up to the US will cease . <p> It is not about whether or not we are better off standing up to the US but the fact that we are integrated so much that the short term pain could affect our political process whereby a party not wanting to stand up could come to power . <p> The only solution to this circular problem would be a government honest enought to seek a mandate to do this where the population understood that the short term pain was behind a long term independence . <p> As well I do not think this can be done in half measures like we typically get from the Liberals . Canada has to have a policy of resistence to a number of things at the same time -- and then deal with the fight -- becuase small resistence will not deliver the independence on policy we need and it will still attract the retribution . <p> At some point we should recognize that Canada is almost at the point where it has to declare an intent to have greater independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public are on board and doing what it can to make sure that the people affected are helped as much as possible . <p> Putting this off only increases the bill . A number of cowardly governments unwilling to pay the price of independence has led the country to become more and more trapped . This latest version of NAFTA , is a continuation of that trend . Rather than get us out this gets us in deeper . <p> So nothing I am saying says I do not think Caanda should seek independence as much as it can , I am just pointing out the risk of this resulting in economic difficulty whichwould result in a Conservative government which would abort the process -- unless we take steps to make sure it does not happen . This requires a couragious and honest government the likes of which we have not seen federally . <p> My point was that whether or not we stand up to the US is irrelevant to the fact I would prefer not to live in the current 5Eyes police state that I find myself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ever come out of the House of Commons because we do not live in a real democracy so I place none of my hope for the future in that realm . <p> I hope that clarifies things for you . <p> So the question was not for me ? You seem to write in a tone of disagreement when there is not any . I do not disagree with anything you said -- just that fact that it was presented in the tone of a rebuttal/question when as it turns out it had nothing to do with my point at all . <p> "" Amid a sharp deterioration in US-European relations , Washington sent a bipartisan delegation of White House officials and members of Congress to the Munich Security Conference to pressure and threaten European countries not to do business with the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei . The conference followed announcements by Germany , France and most recently the UK that they would not ban Huawei from their networks . <p> Huawei 's 5G telecommunications infrastructure is far more advanced that that of its European rivals Nokia and Ericcson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huawei 's technology will put it at a significant disadvantage . But the American officials , with their combination of threats , demagogy and empty promises , got a chilly reception from the European representatives ... "" <p> Behind the USbullying on Huawei you have the real gap between the US and many other countries . Many countries used to do what the US wanted and they recieved a number of perceived benefits in exchange including that the US would spend more on defence . The problem now is partly that the US does not understand the transaction that exists . By not being an ally and making other countries have to pay more for their defence and other moves , the US is no longer putting on the table what if provided in return for many areas of dominance . Now the US is being very aggressive with what it wants : Iran , pipeline position in Europe , Huawei -- but it is pretending that it never got anything for spedning extra and supports it previously provided . It now wants to dominate AND charge for everything it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like most of us here are getting a recpetive audience when we argue agaisnt the US being able to enforce its will outside the US . Why should the US get to deicde what every other country 's position should be ? Why should they get to enforce sanctions nobody wants but themselves ? Now that they do not want to pay why should they get the benefits that were part of the unwritten understanding . People put up with the US doing this for years becuase they felt they got something . Now that the US is behaving aggressively across the board , there is resitence when they are seeking to push poeple around . Trump adminstration does not udnerstand that the US bargaining power and so called soft-power is in decline due to their actions . Some countries have more ability to resist than others of course . <p> Face is huge in diplomacy . All countries have to consider this dealing with all other countries -- it is a myth that this is more about China than anywhere else in my opinion . It is often brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian countries more than here to some degree . I do not think there is a difference when it comes to diplomacy though . Or negotiations in general . <p> I guess we now just let embedded misogyny pass around her , as long as it is directed against our "" enemies . "" . Why is this person worth quoting when this is the only crap that they have to say . The CFO of one of the largest companies in the world gets dissed by a US media lap dog who has not been in China for almost thirty years . If China Change is not a US security forces front organization then I will be gobsmacked . <p> "" I doubt they will be released , because ( the Chinese government wants ) their woman back , "" Cao said , referring to Meng . <p> I guess we now just let embedded misogyny pass around her , as long as it is directed against our "" enemies .

Consider this : in Chinese they refer to people as "" R ? n "" which translates to person . In English refering to getting their person back sounds strange . People speaking in their second language may not as easily manage connotations like this because it is the structure of English -- even if their language is fluent . Very often languages make references to people filtered through gender . Chinese does not do this but Chinese speakers speaking in second languages would learn to find this strange feature not unusual once they get used to the sexist nature of European language . <p> I think you might want to retract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ) if you want to consider that Cao is a woman and your comment smells like mansplaining . <p> ETA : it is disturbing to see attacks on people who are dessenters just becuase the US is engaging in interference and has ulterior motives . There is no reason to assume that people from other countries who oppose their governments are lapdogs or are anything more than people who disagree with their government . ( Interesting that you are calling a woman a dog when you preach about Misogyny . ) Even if this person had support for the wrong reasons in North America it does not give you the right to make assumptions about her motives and even go so far as to question her humanity becuase she called a woman a woman while you ( a man ) call her a dog . <p> I am not engaging in an unfair or rude manner . I even offered to delete if you retracted your comment upon realization that the person you called a misogynist and a lapdog is a woman . You have no right to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you out for something you said . Stop this silly argument that you can insulate yourself from criticism by demanding some people not to respond . <p> Again I make the offer delete all these posts including the first one and I will do the same . <p> You are free to write whatever you like Sean and quote from whatever imperial sycophant yo"
