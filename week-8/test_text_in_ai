"<h> Is Machine Learning Model Management The Next Big Thing In 2020 ? <p> ML and its services are only going to extend their influence and push the boundaries to new realms of the technology revolution . However , deploying ML comes with great responsibility . Though efforts are being made to shed its black box reputation , it is crucial to establish trust in both in-house teams and stakeholders for a fairer deployment . Companies have started to take machine learning model management more seriously now . Recently , a machine learning company Comet.ml , based out of Seattle and founded in 2017 , announced that they are making a $4.5 million investment to bring state-of-the-art meta-learning capabilities to the market . <h> Bringing Meta-Learning To Markets <p> The tools developed by Comet.ml enable data scientists to track , compare , monitor , and optimise model development . Their announcement of an additional $4.5 million investment from existing investors -- Trilogy Equity Partners and Two Sigma Ventures -- is aimed at boosting their plans to domesticate the use of machine learning model management techniques to more customers . <p> Since their product launch in 2018 , Comet.ml has partnered with top companies like Google , General Electric , Boeing and Uber . This elite list of customers use comet.al services , which have enterprise-level toolkits , and are used to train models across multiple industries spanning autonomous vehicles , financial services , technology , bioinformatics , satellite imagery , fundamental physics research , and more . <p> Talking about this new announcement , one of the investors , Yuval Neeman of Trilogy Equity Partners , reminded that the professionals from the best companies in the world choose Comet and that the company is well-positioned to become the de-facto Machine Learning development platform . <p> According to a report presented by researchers at Google , there are several ML-specific risk factors to account for in system design , such as : <p> Boundary erosion <p> Entanglement <p> Hidden feedback loops <p> Consumers who are undeclared <p> Data dependencies , and <p> Configuration issues <p> Debugging all these issues require round the clock monitoring of the model 's pipeline . For a company that implements ML solutions , it is challenging to manage in-house model mishaps . <p> If we take the example of Comet again , its platform provides a central place for the team to track their ML experiments and models , so that they can compare and share experiments , debug and take decisive actions on underperforming models with great ease . <p> Predictive early stopping is a meta-learning functionality not seen in any other experimentation platforms , and this can be achieved only by building on top of millions of public models . And this is where Comet 's enterprise products come in handy . The freedom of experimentation that these meta learning-based platforms offer is what any organisation would look up to . Almost all ML-based companies would love to have such tools in their arsenal . <p> Talking about saving the resources , Comet.ml in their press release , had stated that their platform led to the improvement of model training time by 30% irrespective of the underlying infrastructure , and stopped underperforming models automatically , which reduces cost and carbon footprint by 30% . <p> Irrespective of the underlying infrastructure , it stops underperforming models automatically , which reduces cost and carbon footprint by 30% . <p> The enterprise offering also includes Comet 's flagship visualisation engine , which allows users to visualise , explain , and debug model performance and predictions , and a state-of-the-art parameter optimisation engine . <h> Is This The Dawn Of ML Model Management As A Service ? <p> When building any machine learning pipeline , data preparation requires operations like scraping , sampling , joining , and plenty of other approaches . These operations usually accumulate haphazardly and result in what the software engineers would like to call a pipeline jungle . <p> Now , add in the challenge of forgotten experimental code in the code archives . Things only get worse . The presence of such stale code can malfunction , and an algorithm that runs this malfunctioning code can crash stock markets and self-driving cars . The risks are just too high . <p> So far , we have seen the use of ML for data-driven solutions . Now the market is ripe for solutions that help those who have already deployed machine learning . It is only a matter of time before we see more companies setting up their meta-learning shops or partner with third-party vendors ."

"<h> Myriad Possibilities Of The Application Economy <p> CA Technologies sees big opportunities across Application Program Interface ( API ) , DevOps and agile technologies in the APAC market , with India leading the growth momentum . In his recent visit to India , Martin Mackay , who joined CA Technologies as the President and General Manager , APJ , in December , explains why these technologies are the central part of any digital transformation and what 's driving CIOs to increasingly adopt these practices in order to thrive in the application economy . Excerpts . <p> CXOToday : How does DevOps-first strategy facilitate the digital transformation of an enterprise ? <p> Martin Mackay : If Agile is about creating the ideas , DevOps is about converting those ideas into outcomes . The key components of the DevOps suite are around the continuous delivery , including those around the service virtualization and automated testing and automated release combined with application performance analytics . Now , how does it facilitate transformation ? It enables you get software to market quicker so as to improve the customer experience . Research shows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than by the actual product . If the experience is poor , your customer will go elsewhere in no time . It is here the DevOps as a practice , enables you to integrate the concept , quality and customer insights - all in one . <p> CXOToday : Do you see more Indian companies cozying to API management ? What 's driving enterprises to reap benefits from API ? <p> Martin Mackay : CA Technologies explains API technologies as a set of routines , protocols and tools for building software applications . A recent global study reveals that a majority of surveyed organizations in India recognize the importance of APIs in business growth . According to the study , 85 percent of the Indian firms are confident in the effectiveness of APIs in helping them to differentiate from the competition . This confidence level exhibited by the Indian firms is the highest in APJ , and higher than the average APJ response of 55 percent . <p> APIs are crucial to success in the application economy . They empower enterprises to quickly modernize legacy architectures , add value to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streams . <p> However , simply using APIs is not enough . The full lifecycle approach to API management requires a wide and complex range of capabilities . It demands the ability to connect legacy and current systems ; rapidly create APIs in order to safely expose data ; integrate this with back-end data and legacy apps ; protect these integrations with the right levels of security ; accelerate mobile development ; and unlock the value of the resulting digital ecosystems through analytics and monetization . Once this is understood , companies of all sizes , in all sectors , can use APIs to level the competitive playing field , and cope better with the rising volume , scale and volatility of customer-facing apps . <p> CXOToday : How do you see machine learning and big data shaping IT operations analytics and in turn the enterprise technology space ? <p> Martin Mackay : At this stage , we are trying to bake machine learning and big data into our own applications . In fact , as a part of the change of culture at CA we have created our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are developing products that will eventually get integrated into our products . This is a great source of innovation . The entire operation is run by our Chief Technology Officer . Our product Jarvis was developed as a part of this incubation and has been integrated into our applications analytics experience product . It 's a key part of our strategy to integrate the Jarvis analytics platform into every product . This will facilitate automation and in turn will enhance quality and enable productivity . <p> CXOToday : How does the India market contribute to your global goals ? <p> Martin Mackay : Disruption driven by IT and software is happening across the globe . And India , a key component of CAs overall strategy , is not far behind . In fact , many Indian companies are ahead of their competitors globally when it comes to adoption of technologies and using software for servicing customers , improving operational efficiencies , or creating new business models . India is a big growth engine for us in APJ and as a consequence , because APJ is the fastest growing region in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enterprise customer expect from CA over the next 12 months ? <p> Martin Mackay : There are three things that we are currently focusing on . The first is the accelerator or incubation program , where we are allowing organizations , especially the startups to devote more time to create a world-class product . By providing special access to our demos , expertise , and sales , we aim to build a supportive innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystem across the globe . <p> The second is integrating the existing capabilities that we have by adding new functionality . Our product quality has improved dramatically over the last couple of years based on statistical analysis and customer anecdotal feedback and we will continue to invest in product quality . Finally , building a strong go-to-market strategy , by taking the modern software factory message out to customers in a consistent and robust fashion and that will differentiate . In other words , innovation is not just in product but in culture and how we interact with the market . <p> CXOToday : What would be your advice to CIOs as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin Mackay : Well , digital transformation is everything and it 's time every organization should get this message . They should however , get the message right . They should know digital transformation journey is not just about technology ; It is a combination of culture , process and enabling technology . And it is here that organizations like CA can make your digital transformation experiences more exciting , more relevant and fun . <p> While many believe CIO 's role is evolving and that he 's occupying a key place in the boardroom , a recent study brings to light that more than half of the CIO , CTO or IT admin staff ( 55% ) are not thanked by colleagues for carrying out essential IT tasks on their behalf ."

The decentralisation principle on which blockchain is based makes it nearly impossible for attackers to succeed . <p> Blockchain has the ability of making the products and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting middlemen and central authorities . Blockchain is actually a database , but not an isolated one like IBM 's iconic database that made history in 1970 . It 's a database that works like a network where anyone and anything can connect to it . This means that there 's not a leading player in the network . Experts call this situation ' decentralisation ' . They forecast that the participating actors in the network will reach their common goals thanks to a nearly friction-free cooperation between all of them . So , there 's no need of the iron fist of central authorities or the intervention of middlemen . <p> Main uses in the fashion industry <p> It looks as if most blockchain pioneers in the fashion industry are looking for solutions in mainly two fields : supply chain management and intellectual property . <p> Many apparel companies are under scrutiny because NGOs and consumers have become very sceptical about fashion supply chains . Especially , the so-called millenials ( people born between the early 1980s and the late 1990s ) are said to distrust claims of sustainability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years have been working hard to improve their ranking on the social and environmental scoreboards . Consumers are more and more asking themselves : "" Where does our clothing come from , and exactly what 's gone on before it reaches us ? "" Documentary films like The True Cost ( 2015 ) that looked at environmental , social and financial aspects of the fashion industry , describe an industry that is neither sustainable nor transparent . <p> The hope is that blockchain can not only improve supplier relationships and mutual trust between various players ( buyers , suppliers , logistic companies , etc ) , but can also satisfy consumers who want to make ethical shopping choices . <p> Belgian entrepreneur Niki de Schryver , who 's about to launch the start up COSH ! ( Conscious Shopping Made Easy ) , tells clothing consumers via social media : "" When you as a shopper read something about the unethical working conditions , or water scarcity , poisoned rivers and soil erosion due to the fashion industry , you pledge to change your buying behaviour . But maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you overwhelmed by the amount of information available ? Let COSH help you ! Download the COSH app today . "" Using the COSH app , consumers will be connected with ethical and conscious brands selling in highstreet shops where they are shopping . <p> IP is another field where the use of blockchain could make a big difference . Problems related to IP are multifaceted and complex : securing trade secrets , claiming copyrights , proving prior use , confidentiality agreements , licenses , and correct payments of royalties . Who are the owners of ideas or rights when multiple parties are involved , and who is therefore entitled to payment ? It 's clear that only immutable records of data and timestamping-this actually means the use of blockchain-can bring solutions that satisfy all participants in IP networks . <p> The data analytics company Philagen , based in San Francisco , suggests that fashion companies in future could do without artificial trackers ( like e.g. RFID tags ) in the different stadia of the supply chain . Philagen draws attention to what they call the global microbiome , "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a particular location differ from all other bacteria . They can be identified and used as tags . <p> Some fashion pioneers <p> Maka De Lameillieure , blockchain expert at Antwerp Management School , argues that thanks to blockchain , an end can be made to all kinds of waste in the fashion supply chain . Also , the risk of frauding , for instance by counterfeiting branded products , can be minimised . And for sure , much time and thus money can be saved . De Lameillieure , who originates from the ex-Soviet state Georgia , talks of an example wherein she purchased the house of her parents in her natal country within 10 minutes . The administration cost of the purchase amounted to less than the equivalent of ? 10 . How was that possible ? The simple explanation is that the government of Georgia has implemented blockchain in the national real estate Register ( one of the results was also that two-thirds of the employees at the Register became redundant ) . <p> Provenance is a digital platform that empowers brands to take steps toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the story of fashion designer Martine Jarlgaard who in May 2017 at the Copenhagen Fashion Summit presented the first garment ever tracked with blockchain technology . Using a Provenance app , sustainable alpaca fleece was tracked from shearing in the farm , through to spinning , knitting and eventually finishing in the London studio of Martine Jarlgaard . <p> Another example mentioned on the Provenance website is that of British company Mwear , which in Istanbul had female Syrian refugees at work for the production of accessories and outerwear . <p> Start-up Loomia , in Brooklyn , is using blockchain to follow up what consumers are exactly doing with intelligent clothes , made from Loomia fabrics in which electronic components are integrated . Consumers can earn money by selling their personal data to interested apparel brands . <p> Agricultural blockchain startup Bext360 is partnering with multiple tech companies , especially non-profits and fashion-based platforms , to see if blockchain technology can find a use case in the sourcing of organic cotton . A pilot test will include marking the bags of organic cotton when they are harvested , ensuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being called the Organic Cotton Traceability Pilot , is a partnership between the C&amp;A Foundation , the Organic Cotton Accelerator and Fashion for Good . It 's supported by the C&amp;A company and by Zalando , PVH Corp and the Kering Group . Since the food industry is ahead of the fashion industry in developing blockchain projects , fashion groups are inspired by the methods used by the food industry , like the use of microbiomes to follow materials from origin to finished product . <p> All firms mentioned here are still small fishes which by pursuing transparency hope to create trust and sympathy for their ethical way of doing business . However , there are also some ' early adopters ' of blockchain technology among the big fashion companies as well , like Hugo Boss and Columbia . At the IAF Convention 2018 in Maastricht ( the Netherlands ) , Heinz Zeller , head of Sustainability and Logistics at Hugo Boss , commented on the efforts of Hugo Boss to increase-thanks to blockchain-the transparence of the supply chain and to improve the cooperation between buyers and suppliers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication director of the Save the Garment Center in New York is astonished that so many different tracking systems are used in the worldwide fashion industry and that most of them are obsolete . He pleads for a big leap forward in standardisation , referring to a method which already has been applied successfully in dozens of other industries : blockchain . <p> The start up of New Zealand entrepreneur Samantha Jones wants to contribute to this effort . In July 2017 , Jones received $1.2 million from the NEM Community Fund to create a blockchain-based platform that can track in real time all transcactions and transportation in the apparel supply chain from raw material to final consumer . As a result , she believes , social exploitation and product counterfeiting will become impossible . <p> How big are the chances that blockchain becomes the standard in the fashion industry ? Expert De Lameillieure warns companies that the introduction of blockchain in an enterprise is no walk in the park . About 92 per cent of the blockchain projects that were launched in the last three years are already dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can possibly clash with Article 17 of the European GDPR legislation ( General Data Protection Regulation ) . Since blockchain systematically eliminates the traditional ' middlemen ' from transaction processes , an annoying question arises : to whom can you apply when there 's a problem or dispute ? <p> Barriers to blockchain <p> Other barriers that still need to be overcome include blockchain energy consumption , the scarcity of blockchain developers , the resistance of leaders and middlemen , and the challenge of scaling up the technology in the fashion industry . <p> One of the main things people know about blockchain is that it takes huge amounts of energy , especially when the technology is used to "" mine "" bitcoin . PwC economist Alex de Vries estimates that generating bitcoin alone uses 2.55 gigawatts ( GWs ) of energy a year , almost as much as the Republic of Ireland is using . He remarks that many bitcoin "" miners "" are in China , and use electricity produced by very polluting coal-fired power stations . However , the Climate Ledger Initiative argues that blockchains in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of now , qualified blockchain developers who understand the fashion industry well are difficult to find and therefore very costly . It 's easy to predict that many leaders and middlemen will resist the introduction of blockchain . Blockchain means decentralisation , which goes against the instinct of many leaders . Especially in Western countries , most company owners are still devoted to the principle of ' unity of direction ' advised by Henri Fayol . Blockchain also means direct contact between parties without the intervention of ( mostly costly ) middlemen of all kinds . <h> Disclaimer <p> Responsibility : <p> Fibre2fashion.com does not warrant or assume any legal liability or responsibility for the excellence , accurateness , completeness , legitimacy , reliability or value of any information , product or service represented on Fibre2fashion.com .

"<h> AI-based software may help predict risk of dementia <p> It causes stroke and dementia as well as mood disturbance . SVD increases with age but is accelerated by hypertension and diabetes . <p> IANS May 18 , 2018 , 11:40 IST <p> Researchers have developed a new artificial intelligence-based software which may identify and measure the severity of common causes of strokes and dementia .

"<p> In an exclusive chat with CNBCTV18.com , Zee5 's CEO Tarun Katial speaks about reaching 15 million users by next year , their attempts to hyper-personalize the app to cater to individual needs , how gamification of their popular shows and characters will be the real game-changer and why the idea of an independent body for self-regulation of content does n't appeal to Zee5 . <p> Let 's begin with Zee5 and its journey . Where is the platform today in terms of its reach and presence ? What is the larger vision for Zee5 ? <p> Tarun Katial : I think it 's been a great journey . We 've been able to reach 8.9 million daily active users , and over 80 million monthly actives and a huge watch time . What we 've been able to capitalise is the data and the addressable universe that got created once 4G came into the country . When the ( data ) prices came down , we needed to make sure that we were able to capture , not just the length and breadth of users , but also for users , the device ecosystem , the data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; all of it . So it 's about getting to the KaiOS feature phones on one end and the smart TV on the other end . And all the sub-hundred dollars Chinese phones to Android phones to iOS phones to the entry level smart TVs in between . Then , to be able to deliver video on a very adaptive bitrate through slow 3G ( connections ) , slow 4G and all types of broadband . <p> So the challenge has been largely technological as opposed to content creation ... <p> Tarun Katial : Yes . As you know , we have the 3V strategy -- Vernacular , Video and Voice . Vernacular is very big for us . Our User Interface ( UI ) and User Experience ( UX ) support 12 languages . So ( when ) you get into our app , the first thing we ask you is what 's your language , because that 's the key for us to be able to reach out to those many languages , both in display and content . <p> Display is the tougher one to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language channels . But building the UI in those many languages , navigating consumers in so many languages , that was the tough part . <p> Now coming to voice search - Indian keypads do n't support so many languages , so while you have the content , you have the UI in that language , consumers wo n't be able to consume it . So it was important for us to be able to install the voice search feature which can discover content that quickly and that easily . <p> Besides that , we 've also build a robust AVoD ( Advertising Video-on-Demand ) and SVoD ( Subscription Video-on-Demand ) strategy . We made some very big investments on the AVoD side in building the ad suite . We needed to do all of this because beyond the big tech , very few Indian companies had actually done any work on ad tech . Ad tech is run by big tech companies in India -- Google Facebook and Twitter -- and if we want to compete in the ad space we knew that we needed to build our ad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of building the self-serve bidding model where advertisers can book their own advertising slots , bid for advertising slots , the pricing is on a bidding model and optimise the advertisement themselves on an optimisation engine . <p> You 've got about 8.9 million daily active users as of today . What 's the user base you want to get to ? <p> Tarun Katial : We want to get to a minimum of 15 million daily active users . But for that we need to get watch time up . We need to get more and more hyper-personalised . We 've launched a new recommendation engine and our attempt is that between auto-curation and hyper-personalisation , we should be able to give you what you would like as a segment of one . The more we can do that , the more your app will look different from mine or somebody else 's and our attempt is to really get there . From the time you launch your IP , we are going to be able to give you languages of your state , your UI and UX will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch will be hyper-personalised in terms of the kind of recommendations that come to you . Because we have so many data management platforms , even when a user logs in and has low consumption , we 've understood where he/she comes from and is likely to watch . We can even do cold-start recommendations so that even at the entry level , the app can show content that will excite him/her to come back to the platform . <p> Apart from the vernacular interface and voice recognition features , what are the other technological interjections to hyperpersonalise the UI and UX ? <p> Tarun Katial : So one of the big things is video encoding and transcoding . To be able to serve this device ecosystem , we needed to be backed up by different kind of encoding technology and intuitively be able to offer that to users . So when you launch your app in a slow 3G environment on a slow phone -- a sub-hundred dollar phone -- and your memory is low , we know what kind of video , what MPEG , should be delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use behind it . So the entire content pipeline that delivers the content needs to be intuitive . It ca n't be one size fits all . We are making it hyper-personalised . <p> Given your focus on hyperpersonalisation , how soon do you think you can get to 15 million daily active users ? <p> Tarun Katial : I would think about six months . The way we are investing behind technology , I think we can progressively make that leap . We 've made a significant investment behind our technology teams . It 's a significant percentage of the total cost and we 've upped that technology investment . We 've been able to optimise costs on manpower because we are automating , but we are putting all of that behind technology . <p> We 're doing a lot of automation today . We 've just finished piloting with the tool from Microsoft Azure for self-editing . My 25-minute episode can be converted into a 7-minute episode through machine learning without having to edit it . <p> The machine decides what scenes need to be picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Most of our app today is fully curated through artificial intelligence and machine learning . We do n't do any manual curation anymore . So no human decides what story or show will go up where and how . <p> We are also moving into being able to do packaging of content on the fly . So we 're working with another Israeli product that will be able to create a pack for you , which is significantly different from the current packs which are standard packs ; I can personalize packs for you . <p> At your last investor meeting , Puneet Goenka had spoken about creating lighter user packs . What is on the anvil ? <p> Tarun Katial : I think our effort is to see what we can package within that and what price point we want to be at . So we 're testing two or three packs . These could be regional , hyper-local , hyper-personalised packs , we are looking at what kind of technology can allow us to do this in real time and I think we 're very close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mobile-only plan , much like Netflix . When do we see that happen and how will it play out commercially for Zee5 ? <p> Tarun Katial : We are close to it . Technology-wise we are ready , but we 're just evaluating the way we want to play this out . It may not be just be a mobile pack , it may be packaging of different content into different devices . There are multiple factors at play here , including the number of logins and concurrencies . We are throwing a lot of things in the air and deciding what combination works best . <p> Give us a sense of Zee5 's current revenues and growth rate . When can we expect the platform to break even operationally ? <p> I think it 's working well . We 're seeing significant growth month-on-month , both on the AVoD and SVoD side . I think we 've got some significant tailwinds on the B2C side ; we 've seen some significant movement on that and we 're very proud of that traction . I think today , outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest subscription base in the country . And Prime is not necessarily comparable because it includes shipping , shopping and is essentially an end-to-end retail company and video is just a small component of that . <p> As far as breaking even is concerned , I see ourselves being able to do that within 5 years.On the content side , you have a partnership with ALTBalaji to co-create content that plays out on both platforms . Are you interested in tying up with other OTT platforms as well ? <p> Tarun Katial : Yes we are . We are in talks with a couple of players as well as good production houses . Digital will require a regular supply of good quality content for the needle to move effectively in the large base of India and the addressable market . <p> Tarun Katial : We want to do a little bit of more in India . We want do the Northeast . I think Assamese is an opportunity we want to tap into . One language we have n't done enough in is Malayalam . We want to do more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more content in Kannada . We 've been very surprised to see the kind of off-take we saw in Kannada . We can see all of this come to play in the next six months . <p> At the moment , Zee5 is also investing heavily into franchises -- spinoffs of your popular TV shows as well as direct-to-digital movies . What 's in the pipeline ? <p> Tarun Katial : We will do a lot of it . We may create spin-offs for both old and new shows . Over 27 years , Zee has created some great IP . It 's lying in our treasury and we 're now discovering and recreating it . ' Jamai Raja ' was an old show but it has done humongously well for us in its new version ( ' Jamai 2.0 ' ) . We are also working on almost five such new shows which would come back in some form . Direct-to-digital has been another great space . We 've done some great films like ' Barot House ' , ' 377 ' , ' The Sholay Girl ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers on it . <p> What other segments are you getting into ? <p> Tarun Katial : Kids ' content is a tough market to crack , and we will do two or three things . One , we will obviously acquire some of the content that 's available in the market , both in India as well as internationally . We also want to invest in some original IP . We have some very good IP from ZeeQ ( ZeeQ was launched in 2012 and offers TV content for children between 4 and 14 years ) . For example , ' Bandhbudh and Budbak ' was a very big show and there are several others . So we want to create some of these IPs in the long run . <p> Will you formulate children talent shows specifically for the OTT platform ? <p> Tarun Katial : The talent space is a big space . It 's kind of unique . We will do an on-going challenge on the platform , and participants could eventually find themselves on the TV show . <p> The other space we want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we want to do 2-3 things . One , we want to gamify our platform with the original content and new content that comes on-board . What we 're trying to do through gamification is to let people play along , do specific shows for play-along . We 're in the midst of getting a low latency technology that allows us to do live gamification . <p> We are also gamifying all our TV shows together in one thread . Fantasy leagues as a concept is very popular in sports and is targeted more towards males . We are bringing a similar concept in a very different avatar of ' Indian families ' to the viewers of these shows . So far TV channels have primarily done gamification for non-fiction shows like ' Kaun Banega Crorepati ' . Even on ZEE5 , we have done gamification for our top non-fiction shows like ' Saregamapa ' , ' DID ' and ' Dadagiri ' , which did very well in terms of impressions . This is the first time we are planning a gamification for fiction shows . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gamification for fiction shows . These are shows which have completely involved audience and they love the characters . The idea of this gamification is to take that affinity to these shows and characters to another level , where you are virtually making a family with them and getting a chance to win exciting prizes . The idea of owning your favourite characters comes alive in this gamification . So popular Zee TV shows including ' Kumkum Bhagya ' , ' Kundali Bhagya ' etc will be gamified . It 's a fairly interesting thing we are doing . <p> The industry is divided on the issue of instituting a two-tier mechanism under an independent body much like the Broadcasting Content Complaints Council ( BCCC ) . As I understand , Zee5 , Netflix , MX Player and ALTBalaji are not keen on an independent body . Why ? <p> Tarun Katial : If a two-tier mechanism is going to tell me to pull content down without having a conversation or discussion , it 's a bit tough , right ? That said , I think we will get there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We ca n't jump into it yet . Let the industry agree on a unified code for what is blasphemy , what is not child-friendly , get the age-appropriate classifications , get the entire regulation on grading content and all that done . <p> So , are you saying that will happen only when all the nearly 40 OTT players unify on the self-regulation code ? <p> Tarun Katial : At least a significant number of them . We 've already started . We have parental control , age grading , genre grading , all of it . And it 's just not about grading it , but it 's also about how you post that onto the front end . Do you want the grading to stay all through the video , what classification should we put or not , these are the details that we need to iron out first . All players , Netflix , Voot , ALTBalaji , MX players may it do it differently . <p> Do you feel that a body like BCCC is eventually going to lead to censorship ? <p> Tarun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ censorship because BCCC is also not about censorship . It 's , at some level , guidance for what you do right or wrong . But I do think that there is a difference between broadcast and OTT . In OTT , you look at the thumbnail and you decide to consume it . Then again , there are so many variables such as YouTube , which provides purely UGC content . So it 's not an apple-to-apples comparison either between platforms or between technologies of broadcast and OTT . So it is unfair to apply the standards of film or TV to OTT because they 're different technologies . <p> I still do believe there is a need for some amount of regulation . The industry needs to be responsible . People must think about where this goes for the Indian society . <p> So , I think we all need to come together to at least agree to the first level - get the tier one mechanism in place , see how it works , see how much consumers and policy makers like it and then if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I would find the need for tier two ( mechanism ) if I felt that I am not capable of addressing grievances through tier one . Zee5 has enough checks and balances to be able to deal with consumer complaints . At tier one itself , I believe we have ( an equivalent to ) a two-tier level mechanism , which is my own mechanism , to listen to people . We have a panel of people who look at all the complaints , a customer service team who gives feedback , who holds up the content team and we do make changes ourselves . We are very sensitive to our reputation management . We never want to be seen in a negative light . And for brands that 's extremely important today in the day and age of social transparency .

"<h> Sunday Edition <h> Briefly Speaking <p> Exercising four to five times a week is necessary to stop the main arteries to the heart from stiffening up , research suggests . Two or three exercise sessions a week kept only some arteries healthy , a study of 100 people in their 60s found . The researchers said any form of exercise reduced the risk of heart problems . But the right amount of exercise at the right time in life could reverse the ageing of the heart and blood vessels . The study , published in The Journal of Physiology , looked at participants ' exercise history throughout their lives and measured the stiffness of their arteries . Arteries are blood vessels which transport blood in and out of the heart and to all parts of the body . Each one is shaped like a tube and as people age , they are prone to stiffening . An unhealthy lifestyle also causes the arteries to become blocked with fatty material . The researchers found that exercising two to three times a week ( 30 minutes per session ) over a lifetime led to more youthful middle-sized arteries supplying blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diff. b/w hiv and hpv <p> The top trade association for the adult entertainment industry is trolling President Trump with an open letter explaining the difference between HIV and HPV .

"<h> Rising out of a personal tragedy , 2 brothers create FYERS to become youngest stockbrokers <p> Twenty years ago , three young boys , all under 10 years of age , were orphaned and taken under the wings of their grandmother and aunt . They survived a long and arduous war against social stigma surrounding debt , which had tragically ended their parents ' lives . <p> The boys do n't want to discuss the trauma following their parents ' death , but , driven by the sheer will to survive , the three of them forged a bond to do the best in anything that they aspire to achieve . Two of the brothers , backed by the eldest , are now some of the youngest stock brokers in the country , and have launched their own startup , FYERS , which is an acronym for Focus Your Energy and Reform Yourself . A tribute to their brotherhood and all the trials it helped them get past . <p> From Left to Right ( seated ) : founders Tejas K and Yashas K ( third and fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first week of August 2015 , and 25-year-old Tejas N K and 27-year-old Yashas N K fly to Mumbai to meet the authorities at the National Stock Exchange ( NSE ) at the Bandra Kurla Complex . They are anxious because they are there to get a licence to become stockbrokers , and anticipate a slew of tough questions from witty and wise stockbrokers at the NSE . <p> The two brothers had spent the first part of 2015 preparing for this moment . They worked 18 hour days to create an equity-based investment platform that allowed people to invest based on intelligence offered by the trading engine . The two brothers filed for the stockbroking licence in June 2015 , and they were called in by the NSE to make a presentation about the company in August . <p> "" The NSE authorities were surprised that a couple of 20-somethings had applied for a stockbroking licence and to our surprise we got our licence in less than a month , "" says Tejas . <p> The FYERS app competes with broker-led online trading platforms -- like those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kite , by Zerodha . There are apps like Finozen too that are trying to make investments easy , but they are focussed on mutual funds . <p> FYERS , on the other hand , wants to focus on equity investments and also offers mutual fund services on its platform . This new form of trading with daily information , without having a fund manager handling the stock is new in India . It is tailor-made for the millennial generation , provided they invest in stocks . Sixty percent of Indian stock markets are filled with promissory notes that originate from abroad . The FYERS business model is based on theme-based investments and investors can choose from a 100 different themes with over 1,500 high-value stocks being covered on the platform . FYERs makes Rs 100 based on every transaction or change in portfolio . <p> While the young lads have their stockbroking credentials and a future , their beginnings were not so eventful . <h> The early years <p> The eldest brother , 29-year-old Shreyas N K , entered business at the early age of 13 and helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "" Our parents had left us a hospitality business and we ran it with an accountant , who helped us rebuild our lives , "" explains Tejas , adding that the only way to get past the overwhelming grief of losing parents at such a young age was to work and study hard . <p> While building the hospitality business they also began investing at a very young age . "" By the time I was 18 , I was investing in stocks and reading about the market . I got my younger brother hooked too , "" says Tejas . <p> Yashas , while completing his Economics honours , realised that he was more into algorithms and machine learning . "" Being influenced by my brothers I thought I should learn economics . But I was fascinated with software and data , "" he adds . <p> The duo thank their older brother for coming through and having their back . "" His studies took a backseat . But we made him finish his degree through correspondence , "" says Yashas . <p> Their formative years were devoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they spent time poring over financial papers , tracking stocks and learning how to build software applications . <p> Days were spent in college , and evenings were busy with running the hospitality business . "" It was not easy running the hospitality business . A lot of people did take us for granted and wanted to take advantage of us . Thankfully , our accountant , who has passed on now , saved us from being cheated by people , "" says Tejas . <h> The birth of FYERS <p> When things began settling down the three brothers ventured into education . Tejas finishes his Master 's in Finance and worked in a couple of stockbroking firms between 2012 and 2015 before thinking of starting a stockbroking and investment business . "" The idea was to build an intelligence layer that could advice people to invest or pull out of stocks . We aimed at removing the human layer from advising retail investors , "" he explains . When he took the idea to Yashas and asked him if building such tech was possible , the younger brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear of investing from the minds of people . The app throws notifications asking them to move in and out of stocks based on studied events or by predicting an event . The brothers say massive engineering work had gone into building a predicitve analysis engine . <p> "" We are eventually a platform that uses massive data . For this to kick in we need investors data and correlate it to the data of external news and events , "" says Yashas . <p> The brothers have invested close to Rs 1 crore of their own money to build the business . They believe the future is in fintech and programmatic advice . Globally , there are companies like Robinhood , Bux Pulls , E Trade , AmeriTrade , and even PayPal has invested in an investment app for millennials called Acorns . Japanese payment tech firm Rakuten invested $30 million in it . So the interest in this industry is very high . <p> "" There are several businesses that are building app trading platforms .

"<h> AI technique can boost brain scans to predict Alzheimer early <p> 24-Nov-2018 New York <p> Posted 07 Nov 2018 <p> Artificial intelligence ( AI ) can help improve the ability of brain imaging techniques to predict Alzheimer 's disease early , according to a study . <p> Researchers from the University of California in San Francisco ( UCSF ) trained a deep learning algorithm on a special imaging technology known as 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) . <p> They included more than 2,100 FDG-PET brain images from 1,002 patients and on an independent set of 40 imaging exams from 40 patients . <p> The results showed that the algorithm was able to teach itself metabolic patterns that corresponded to Alzheimer 's disease . <p> It also achieved 100 per cent sensitivity at detecting the disease an average of more than six years prior to the final diagnosis . <p> "" We were very pleased with the algorithm 's performance .

"<p> Amit Anand says Singapore is showing signs of developing into a good base for building solutions with global potential in areas such as deep tech , IoT , SaaS , AI and fintech . <p> South-East Asia comprises as many as 10 different countries , but it is a "" homogeneous "" region for start-up investing , argues Amit Anand , founder and managing partner of Singapore-based venture capital firm Jungle Ventures which counts Ratan Tata , chairman emeritus of Tata Sons Ltd , as a special advisor . <p> According to Anand , start-ups should look for homogenous market segments within South-East Asia ( SEA ) which are sizeable . <p> "" Our hypothesis is that metros behave in a very similar manner in SEA in terms of supply , demand , consumer behaviour , socio-economics and infrastructure and , therefore , once a start-up figures out an expansion playbook , with some level of localization , it can replicate its growth with increasing efficiency , "" he said in an interview . <p> Edited excerpts : <p> Your recent report points out that SEA metros have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not many start-ups have been targeting the region ; often for start-ups in this region , once they hit maybe two countries in SEA , their first port of expansion is the US , Japan or even HK ( Hong Kong ) . Does the challenge of targeting SEA as a whole appear too daunting for most start-ups even in their growth phase ? <p> A majority of the regional start-ups , especially in the past 2-3 years , which are solving real emerging world issues , remain focused on the SEA region -- whether it be in travel , fashion brands , financial services , etc . Our portfolio has sufficient examples of the same as well -- Iflix , Pomelo , iMoney , Mobikon and many others . The US or Japan are great enterprise software markets and we usually encourage start-ups in that space to find early customer wins in those markets . <p> Is SEA really a ' homogeneous ' region for start-up investing as you are making it out be ? Agreed , everyone says Asean ( Association of South-East Asian Nations ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a billion -- but are you not literally building out expertise in many different markets . The Philippines , Indonesia and Singapore are very different markets , with different operating models and with different cultural challenges . Indonesia is a different ball game altogether . <p> The way to think about this is to look for homogenous market segments within SEA which are sizeable . Our hypothesis is that metros behave in a very similar manner in SEA in terms of supply , demand , consumer behaviour , socio-economics and infrastructure and , therefore , once a start-up figures out an expansion playbook , with some level of localization , it can replicate its growth with increasing efficiency . The same way that India maybe a billion people but the online shoppers are only 40-50 million people , primarily in the eight metro cities -- each of which is differing in local language , culture , infrastructure , traffic , demographics , etc . Our hypothesis says that the same is true of SEA and businesses and investors should size the opportunity accordingly . <p> Currently , for most global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to Asia , and may be followed by Indonesia . Those who feel that they 've missed the China bus , they focus on India first before looking at SEA . When do you see that mindset change ? <p> The Indian Internet landscape has evolved rapidly over the past 10-15 years and , comparatively , SEA is still a young ecosystem , 5-6 years behind us . In that sense we have come a long way and exciting times lie ahead . On one end , we see increased attention to SEA by global VCs ( venture capital firms ) , LPs ( limited partners ) and also tech giants ; but on the other hand , we strongly believe that SEA is still undercapitalized as compared to the opportunity potential . <p> When you 've seen the start-up ecosystems evolve across India and SEA , what are the similarities and what are the major differences ? What are the big learnings that the ecosystem in this region can take from a market like India ? <p> The differences are that SEA start-up ecosystem has grown with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , incubators as well as the support of governments . In India on the other hand , angel investment activity has really kicked in substantially only in the past two years . <p> Second is the availability of engineering talent . Given the steady stream of talent from the top engineering schools as well as a large IT ( information technology ) and software industry , Indian start-ups have access to enough engineers to scale rapidly . SEA start-ups are having to be more careful and deliberate about this as a challenge . <p> The similarities are the market needs and problems which start-ups can solve are quite similar in India and SEA , which is infrastructure , traffic , lack of payment options , lack of quality financial products available easily , not enough local , affordable brands . <p> Therefore , the challenges start-ups solve for the customer needs they are addressing have played out in a similar manner . Jungle 's investment hypothesis has also been shaped by the learnings from the India market , which we see as being several years ahead of SEA from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solutions to these problems in SEA . <p> Overall , how are deal flows in this region ( SEA ) looking like ? A common complaint is that while dry powder is available , the region is not producing requisite deal flows for deployment . Do you agree ? <p> We used to see 200 deals a year in 2012 which is now closer to 2,500 deals annually . In the past few years at least 20-30 seed stage funds and 10-15 series A/B funds have been actively investing in the market , leading to a few hundred start-ups approaching the Series B/C/D stages now . We think this is an extremely vibrant ecosystem and continues to produce very interesting investing opportunities both at a regional level but also starting to show some global potential . <p> As a VC fund in Singapore , what is your take on the start-up scene here ? When targeting SEA , is Singapore more of a place where you park your company -- register it here as the legal system and intellectual property climate is good , and then operate and target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two engines of start-up activity in SEA . Singapore in particular is showing signs of developing into a good base for building solutions with global potential in areas such as deep tech , IoT ( Internet of Things ) , SaaS ( Software as a Service ) , AI ( artificial intelligence ) and fintech , among others . Also , if you are looking to hire experienced professionals , then Singapore has the deepest talent pool from different industries that have used this as a base for their regional operations for decades . Where else can you hire such senior talent in the region as you think about scaling your business ? <p> Is Indonesia the next big bet ? <p> As we highlighted in our report , we definitely feel Indonesia is a large opportunity in the medium to long term . However , similar to India , the number of people who are actively shopping online or have the power to spend is still small , compared with the overall population , though rapidly growing . Therefore , for network-based business models which derive their strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large homogenous market worth focusing on . However , for discretionary consumption-based business models , the metros of SEA also depend on a large immediately addressable target market . <p> You 've hit the final close of your second fund . What is your investment thesis for this region ? Any specific sectors that you are keen on and why ? Also , what are your ticket sizes like ? <p> We did the final close of our fund of $100 million which is focused on Series A and B investments in SEA and India . Our typical ticket sizes are in the range of $1-5 million as the first investment with an intent to invest $5-15 million in each key portfolio company as they scale to new levels . In terms of sectors , we are agnostic -- but have been making numerous investments in the B2B ( business-to-business ) , fintech and vertical commerce categories , and remain bullish on defensible opportunities in these spaces . <p> What is the pain point for this region ? Is it Series B onward -- say in the $10-$20-$30 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in South-East Asia . Specialized guys and global funds may not do small ticket deals , but even the $10-$30 million is not easily accessible here . <p> Later-stage investors for Series B/C/D is one of the things we are focused on finding for our portfolio companies as they scale . There are a few funds focusing on those stages in SEA and a few more are being raised now , but we definitely feel there is more scope on that front . <p> India has a reasonably mature venture capital space , but exits are still a problem . Are a lack of big exits hurting the ecosystem ? <p> We see exit activity , especially M&amp;A ( mergers and acquisitions ) being fairly frequent in SEA , and , therefore , are hopeful of that activity starting to pick up pace as some local start-ups become unicorns and also Chinese , US and Indian companies start to look seriously at this region . Exit activity , especially in terms of large exit outcomes , has still been low and more of those exits would definitely help with global investor confidence ."

As more and more digital solutions are rolled out to enhance customer experience , there is a need to strengthen employee experience through digital solutions so that they can empathize and engage more strongly with customers . <p> This also puts onus on leaders to transcend organizational boundaries and look outward , without limiting themselves to the pressures of the industry , of shareholders , and the organization . <h> Use of analytics and automation to solve the system 's inefficiencies is creating demand for new talent <p> The healthcare industry is becoming increasingly data reliant . Business operations can not be conducted in silos but in alignment with analytics . A 2017 study from BCC Research Global showed that the healthcare analytics spending is predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Similarly , with overall cost reduction and efficiency becoming an area of priority for all healthcare leaders , automation of manual tasks and use of artificial intelligence can be a vital part of the overall strategy .

As part of their training the first half of the curriculum enables the recruits ' to spend a day with seniors and experience a typical day in the life of an 80-85 year old . Since seeing is believing , the employees are able to experience empathy firsthand , which helps them to be more compassionate in their engagement with seniors . <p> The second half of the curriculum involves a game , where the employees are required to answer mock calls and perform tasks in the virtual space , thereby earning credits .

"<h> Read Next <p> A career in data science can be exciting but it also comes with its fair share of challenges . In this highly competitive data science industry , you need to devise an effective plan to get hired -- more than just complex projects and a strong basic foundation . To decode such strategies , we as a part of our weekly column called ' My Journey In Data Science ' , interviewed Imaad Mohamed Khan . He is a data scientist and a serial entrepreneur for the past few years . <p> Imaad Mohamed Khan 's interview at Cypher2019 <h> The Background <p> Khan is based out of Bengaluru , where he completed his schooling and graduation from MSRIT in Electronics and Communication Engineering . He then went on to pursue his masters in Internet Technologies and Information Systems from TU Braunschweig , Germany . <p> However , his journey in data science commenced only when he took an online course on Coursera in 2014 . While talking about his love for data science , Khan stressed on his proficiency in solving mathematical problems in school , and the programming skills that he acquired in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a mix of problem-solving , mathematics , and programming skills , "" says Khan . <p> Although data science seemed an obvious career choice because of his various capabilities , he had to struggle when he moved forward with his masters to gain knowledge in the computer science domain . "" It was an arduous task as I did not come from a computer science background . I had to double down and improve domain skills , "" mentioned Khan . "" During my time in Germany , I worked on my research project , and my master thesis was machine learning projects , helping me obtain an understanding of the data science field , "" he added . <h> Strategy To Get A Job <p> Like any aspiring data scientists , initially , Khan was optimistic to get as he had a master 's degree , a wide range of ML projects , data intuition skills , among others . However , it was n't to be -- he had to deal with rejections and self-doubts . Consequently , he devised different strategies to get offers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers . His plan was to tackle the following : <p> Search on job portals <p> Write blog posts and personal project <p> References <p> LinkedIn <p> GitHub <p> StackOverflow <p> Kaggle and Hackathons <p> Attend meetups <p> While Khan cited how just like others , he started by applying through job portals , which he says , is the most difficult way . "" Unfortunately , most of the aspirants focus mostly on applying through job portals . Rather , they should diversify their job hunt by generating content related to data science projects , ask for referrals , find jobs on LinkedIn , "" explains Khan . "" I implemented those and got at least one offer from each strategy , "" he added <p> Besides , he also described some effective ways that his friends and colleagues embraced to get a job : Creating a great profile on GitHub and StackOverflow , competing on Kaggle and Hackathons , and attending meetups . <p> While there could be many ways , the aforementioned are effective ones and can work for most of the aspirants . <h> Surviving In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy to survive in the massive data science ecosystem , Khan depicted that he had to convince himself that the data science landscape is enormous and can not be an expert on every technique , but he always remains open to learning new methodologies as and when required . Khan says , as the technologies are moving fast it is crucial to keep learning throughout the course of the journey . He took this inspiration from Andrew Ng , who continually strives to enhance his skills . <p> Such clarity in thoughts has led Khan to assist his company in delivering new products . More notably , in an internal hackathon , he implemented a search engine that was placed in production . On the other hand , among the most difficult experiences , Khan said he finds it difficult to convince non-technical people on ML and AI can not do , at least at this point of time . <h> Guidance For Budding Data Scientists <p> "" Engaging with the data science community is of paramount importance . This helps in learning from diverse people from around the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed to various perspectives . My advice to aspiring data scientist would be to be open to learning new things , "" concludes Khan . <p> Also see : <h> Enjoyed this story ? Join our Telegram group .

"<p> People recovered from Covid-19 being discharged from the Krishna Hospital in Karad , Maharashtra , Wednesday , May 20 , 2020 . ( PTI ) <p> Mandeep R. Mehra , an India-born cardiologist and professor at the Harvard Medical School , has a message for India 's department of health research and hundreds of other healthcare institutions around the world offering hydroxychloroquine to coronavirus disease patients : "" please stop "" . <p> Mehra and his colleagues on Friday published a study involving 671 hospitals from six continents that has shown that this anti-malarial drug "" repurposed "" for Covid-19 increases the risk of death and serious heart rhythm disorders among patients with Covid-19 who receive it during hospitalisation . <p> In other words , patients who receive this drug are more likely to die or develop serious heart rhythm disorders than patients who do not . <p> Their findings , published in The Lancet , a leading medical journal , suggest not only an absence of therapeutic benefit but also potential harm with the use of hydroxychloroquine or with another related drug chloroquine in hospitalised patients with Covid-19 . <p> The results are relevant to countries across the world , including India where the Indian Council of Medical Research has recommended hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for patients with severe Covid-19 and as a shield for healthcare workers and even paramilitary and police personnel on Covid-19 duty . <p> India 's health ministry on Monday recorded a fresh unprecedented overnight spike of 6,977 new Covid-19 cases , raising the number of confirmed cases to 138,845 of whom 57,721 have recovered and 4,021 have died . The ministry has not said what proportion of "" active "" patients under medical supervision -- 77,103 on Monday -- are receiving hydroxychloroquine . <p> In a telephone interview with The Telegraph , Mehra who was born in Delhi and studied medicine at the Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences , Nagpur , before pursuing specialisation in the US , speaks about the findings and its implications . <p> Q : What should doctors do now given your study 's findings ? <p> Mehra : The off-label use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine should be stopped immediately . We found increased risk of mortality and serious heart rhythm disruptions of two to five fold higher among patients who received either of these two drugs with or without another common antibiotic . We have suggested that any use of this drug should be only in context of randomised clinical trials . <p> Q : What did you find and why is it significant ? <p> Mehra : We found clear signals from a very large observational and global study in 96,000 patients that the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in patients with Covid-19 actually increases their risk of mortality and their risk of developing ventricular arrythmias which is a serious cardiac rhythm disorder . <p> The study involved observing nearly 96,000 people . But its significance does not lie only in its size . It is also because it spanned six continents . This gives us a worldwide view of what 's happening . It has allowed us to generate real-world evidence on the effects of these drugs on patients with Covid-19 . <p> Mandeep R Mehra ( Picture sourced by The Telegraph ) <p> Q : You 're a senior cardiologist . What made you probe therapy in Covid-19 ? <p> Mehra : Early this month , we had published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine that found no harm when commonly used cardiovascular medications were used to treat patients that developed Covid-19 . While working on that , we realised we had this large global collaboration of hospitals on six continents . Covid-19 was hitting hospitals around the world with high velocity , bringing more and more patients into this registry . There were questions about the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine , especially around cardiovascular rhythm risks . We thought we could use this collaboration to explore this aspect of the disease . <p> Q : So did your study piggyback on an existing collaborative network ? <p> Mehra : Yes , this is a large collaboration involving hundreds of hospitals scattered across six continents , trying to use clinical data to generate useful information relating to cardiovascular diseases . It uses data , informatics and analytics to guide clinical decisions and is supported by machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms . <p> Q : How widespread is this use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in Covid-19 patients ? <p> Mehra : Almost every country is now giving it to patients , although not to all patients . Among the 96,000 patients our study analysed between December 20 , 2019 , and April 14 , 2020 , around 15,000 patients had been prescribed these drug . So , roughly one in five patients are given the drug . But there are reports of people and countries stockpiling the drug . <p> Q : Indian health authorities have recommended hydroxychloroquine as a potential preventive medication for healthcare workers and paramilitary and police on Covid-19 duties . Does your study have implications for this recommendation ? <p> Mehra : Our study looked at hospitalised patients which is a completely different population from healthy healthcare workers . We can not answer the question about prophylactic ( preventive ) efficacy of hydroxychloroquine . But our study showed clear signals of the potential harm in the patients who received the drug . Anyone who takes this drug should do so under extremely well-monitored and controlled conditions ."

Although the trend has been there for a while now , it would further advance . Additionally , we will see various functions being outsourced to service providers , or experts . There will be high dependency on chatbots for screening candidates , addressing day-to-day queries of employees on the floor , and taking care of more such activities . <p> Furthermore , flexible work arrangements and movement towards the gig economy will give reasons to the professionals to revisit their policies , processes and bring ease and flexibility .

Myntra plans to open offline stores for its private brand Roadster before the end of this year . <p> Bengaluru : Flipkart-owned online fashion retailer Myntra , which acquired smaller rival Jabong earlier this year , aims to hit $2 billion in revenue run rate and also turn profitable by the end of the 2017-18 fiscal year , driven mainly by a rapidly growing user base . <p> Myntra chief executive Ananth Narayanan on Thursday said Myntra 's acquisition of Jabong had also boosted the company 's numbers , adding that it wants to turn Ebitda-positive in the next financial year . Ebitda is short for earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation , an indicator of operating profitability . <p> "" This year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best year Myntra has ever had -- we grew roughly 80% year-on-year . We hit $1-billion run rate during the year , in terms of annualized run rate ... and that 's primarily because our monthly active user base grew . And that was n't during a sale month -- but on an ongoing basis , "" said Narayanan . <p> Narayanan , who expects Myntra to post 100% revenue growth next year , said the company wants to improve its net promoter score ( NPS ) -- a leading indicator of customer satisfaction -- to about 60% by the end of the next financial year , from the current levels of about 50% . <p> Myntra , which was acquired by Flipkart in 2014 , is planning to use smart technology such as artificial intelligence to enhance consumer experience and use customer data to create personalised stores . <p> The fashion retailer will curate clothing lines based on fashion trends and also launch a mobile app-based chat support service for customers next week to enable users and the brands listed on the portal to interact . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we became unit-economics positive for the first time ...

"<h> Scientist To Become First Cyborg <p> A terminally-ill scientist who is dying from a muscle wasting disease has taken the final steps to become the world 's first full cyborg . Peter Scott-Morgan , 61 , was diagnosed with motor neurone disease two years ago , but instead of accepting his fate he decided to challenge what it meant to be human . <p> He said he wanted to push the boundaries of what science can achieve so decided to extend his life and become fully robotic -- known as Peter 2.0 . <p> The world-renowned roboticist has already undergone a series of incredibly complex and risky operations during his journey . This has included developing a remarkably lifelike avatar of his face before he lost any muscle . The avatar is designed to respond using artificially intelligent body language and he has also explored eye-tracking technology to enable him to control multiple computers using only his eyes . <p> And this week he announced the final procedure in his transition into a robot where he traded his voice for potentially decades of life . Scott-Morgan labelled this final procedure as the end of Peter 1.0 with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is my last post as Peter 1.0 . Tomorrow ( Thursday 10/10 ) I trade my voice for potentially decades of life as we complete the final medical procedure for my transition to Full Cyborg , the month I was told statistically I would be dead . I 'm not dying , I 'm transforming . Oh , how I love science . "" <p> Speaking of his transition , he said : "" ' I 'm about to be turned into Peter 2.0 . And when I say ' Peter 2.0 ' , I mean ' a Cyborg ' ... And when I say ' Cyborg ' , I do n't just mean any old cyborg , you understand , but by far the most advanced human cybernetic organism ever created in 13.8 billion years . I 'm scheduled to become the world 's very first full Cyborg . Almost everything about me is going to be irreversibly changed -- body and brain . It goes without saying that all my physical interaction with the world will become robotic .

"" <p> He has undergone further surgery in what he believes to be the first ever operation of its kind , to insert a feeding tube directly into his stomach , a catheter directly into his bladder and a colostomy bag directly onto his colon . These procedures will help him to deal with any potential feeding and toileting problems , helping him to maintain his independence . <p> Despite the risks of operations and being terminally ill , Scott-Morgan says he is not interested in how to survive his condition , he intends to ' thrive . ' In fact , The Scott-Morgan Foundation which he set up with his husband , Francis , seeks to use artificial intelligence , robotics and other hightechnology systems to transform the lives of those ' restricted by age , ill-health , disability , or other physical or mental disadvantage .

"<h> Fake news , the DNA of tech firms : The big fight against fake news <p> Technology companies like Google , Twitter , Facebook and Microsoft are also gearing up to fight the menace of fake news . <p> A Buzzfeed analysis found that Facebook News Feed played a key catalyst role in the spread of the top 20 fake news stories relating to the 2016 US presidential election . <p> The rise and crowning of Donald Trump has led to global interest in the phenomenon of "" fake news "" , though the dissemination of false and malicious information has been around for thousands of years . Rameses the Great , who was the second-most durable king of ancient Egypt , propagated a compelling story , with detailed accounts of battle scenes , of a stunning victory for Egyptians in the Battle of Kadesh , though now it is established that the battle was in fact a stalemate . <p> The Oxford Leaner 's Dictionary defines fake news as "" false reports of events , written and read on websites "" . While the problem of intentionally malicious news stories in print media , or "" yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and web-based technologies have enabled the spread of false information at lightning speed with negligible costs to propagators . <p> Through freemium business models which generate advertising revenue by merely attracting users to the website , unscrupulous media publishers find it profitable to publish sensational and even false stories to earn profits . In turn , these fake stories spread to millions of users on social media . ( Freemium business model , especially on the Internet , is one by which basic services are provided free of charge while more advanced features must be paid for ) . <p> A Buzzfeed analysis found that Facebook News Feed played a key catalyst role in the spread of the top 20 fake news stories relating to the 2016 US presidential election . Thus , platforms like Facebook and Google and cross-platform messenger apps like WhatsApp have also democratised misinformation , indoctrination and spread of rumours . A BBC News story on December 5 , 2016 , said : "" Many of the fake news websites that sprang up during the US election campaign have been traced to a small city in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earn cash from advertising . "" The phenomenon of news in the world of online communities and platforms with global reach provides power to malicious elements without any commensurate accountability and has the potential to disrupt the social order and adversely impact open societies in democracies . In July 2018 , a British parliamentary committee recommended that the UK government should hold technology companies responsible and liable for "" harmful and illegal content on their platforms "" because "" fake news "" threatens democracy . <p> While it is acknowledged that the originating source for "" fake news "" may have malicious intent , the lightning spear of fake news is propelled by millions of social media platform users facilitated by technology companies like Google and Facebook , which owns WhatsApp , and Microsoft , which owns the search engine Bing.com . Due to First Amendment rights in the US which provide constitutional guarantee to free speech , and various legal provisions to protect freedom of expression in democratic societies , it is often hard to prevent a person from writing an article devoid of facts . Therefore , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users of social media platforms , technology companies and regulatory authorities . <p> Increasingly , more governments are rising to meet this challenge . A Singapore parliamentary committee last week , as reported by Reuters , recommended that governments should enact laws to ensure that technology companies implement measures to fight "" deliberate online falsehoods "" . This followed efforts to apply pressure on the UK , Germany , France and EU to regulate technology companies , requiring them to rein in fake news . Recognising fake news is the first step that users of social media must take if they intend to be "" part of the solution "" rather than be "" the problem "" . <p> The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions ( https : //www . Ifla.org ) provides a guide to assist users like us to recognise fake news . Most importantly , they suggest that readers should consider the reliability of source , assess the supporting sources , check the identity of authors , and most critically review their own biases before forwarding or broadcasting that content to others . International Fact-Checking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an international collaborative effort and not only provides fact-checking services and training but has also published a code of principles . Governments are also taking the lead and as a first , Taiwan has introduced a new school curriculum in 2017 that teaches students to identify propaganda and evaluate sources of online content through a new course called "" media literacy "" . <p> Technology companies like Google , Twitter , Facebook and Microsoft are also gearing up , willingly or unwillingly , to implement appropriate algorithms to fight the menace of fake news . After being in a state of denial for almost a year , Mark Zuckerberg in September 2017 , admitted , "" After the election , I made a comment that I thought the idea that misinformation on Facebook changed the outcome of the election was a crazy idea . Calling that crazy was dismissive and I regret it . This is too important an issue to be dismissive . "" <p> Twitter is creating Ads Transparency Centre for political ads to ensure full disclosure , improving their algorithms to "" stamp out bot accounts targeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trending topics and conversations "" for any fake news .

"<p> State Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banker who does n't pull his punches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains why the banks are increasingly veering towards the bankruptcy resolution process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code ( IBC ) : it 's transparent , it 's fair , and bankers have less reason to worry about post facto scrutiny into commercial decisions they need to take today . Loan defaulting promoters can no longer assert their fundamental right of control over the enterprises that they have run into the ground . That is the harsh reality that everyone must wake up to in the current scenario , he says . <p> TT : The biggest challenge before banks today is the surge in non-performing accounts ( NPAs , or bad loans ) . How do you see this entire process of debt resolution play out for the banking industry as a whole and for State Bank of India in particular ? <p> A : The challenge on the asset quality front is continuing . The previous year was one of the most challenging . And after the Reserve Bank of India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's clear that all the banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must recognise and provide correctly . But the impact of this ( change in asset recognition rules ) is that , going forward , the fresh accretion to NPAs will come down for most of the banks . And for the State Bank of India , it will definitely come down . In a way , the substantial recognition ( of bad loans ) ... or what you call the cleanup of the balancesheet ... happened in the previous year . That is why the results in the previous year for most of the banks are not going to be very good . I feel this year will be better . Last year , it was a year of despair . This year , I call it the year of hope . And I am very convinced about it when I look at my accounts -- individual and large accounts . The gross slippage , which is one of the measures of asset quality , will definitely be much lower than what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the resolution process goes , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 12 cases was referred to the national company law tribunal ( NCLT ) . Most of these are in resolution stage ... but there have been some hiccups here and there ... <p> TT : Are you happy with the pace of resolution ? Let 's put it this way : do you think it was unrealistic to set a 270-day deadline for resolution under the IBC process ? <p> A : I do n't think that is an unrealistic deadline . These are stressed assets ... so it is important to find a solution as quickly as possible . But they are also large and complex accounts . So , it does take time . The thing about a timeline is that if you were even to set a 360-day time limit ( for resolution ) , then you might arrive at the conclusion that even 360 days is not sufficient . And because it is a new law , a lot of judicial interpretations and other issues are cropping up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But once the law gets settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot will depend on the pace of decision-making by the NCLT and the availability of sufficient benches . The flow of the bankruptcy cases to the NCLT is going to rise . And if we do n't have a sufficient number of benches , then we will be in a situation where a backlog will start building . And if that happens , a 270-day deadline will not be sufficient . But I would say that it ( the IBC process ) is much better than the alternative mechanisms for debt resolution that existed earlier . <p> TT : But this has spawned an entire business of forum shopping by litigants . You go to a tribunal in Ahmedabad and get a verdict . That becomes a point of reference for an unrelated case before some other tribunal . It complicates the entire situation because interpretations are different . Does that unsettle the resolution process ? <p> A : Well , there are different NCLT benches , so there could be different interpretations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then there will be only one interpretation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it goes to the Supreme Court , then it settles the matter finally . In many cases , we are finding that it is ultimately the Supreme Court that is interpreting the law . And the law is evolving . And when the law is evolving , I think we must have a little patience . As more and more pronouncements come , either from the appellate tribunal or the Supreme Court , then they will become benchmark judgments . And gradually the NCLT orders will start conforming to the pronouncements of the higher judicial bodies . That will happen ; we need not be impatient about this . <p> TT : The worry is because the alternative mechanisms for debt resolution have been closed down ... <p> A : ... They have not been closed down . If you look at the RBI 's February 12 circular , it says that you can do whatever you want to do ... but you must do it within six months . We are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glossary ) . You need to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unable to find a resolution plan and implement it within six months , then as of now it is mandatory that all cases involving an exposure of more than Rs 2000 crore from the banking system will have to be referred to the NCLT . <p> The Joint Lenders Forum ( JLF ) has been discontinued . But in most of the cases , bankers still sit around . We do n't give it the name of JLF but it still is a either a consortium or a multiple banking arrangement . If there is a stressed asset , bankers will sit down and try and find a solution . And if everybody does not agree ( on the resolution plan ) , then the only route is NCLT . So , it puts some pressure on the borrower as well as the lender to complete the resolution plan within a time-bound manner . And when we do this plan , we look at the best option for the bank . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be the first course of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course there is not much of a choice ( but to go to the NCLT ) . <p> TT : Coming back to the RBI circular , do banks feel comfortable with the idea of the one-day default rule and will the provisioning in the industry go up ? <p> A : No , no ... the provisioning will not go up . The norm for NPA classification remains 90 days . One-day default only means that you start reporting ( the default ) and start thinking about ways to resolve it . If it is a one-day or a two-day default and the company has paid , the reporting still happens every Friday covering all loan accounts of Rs 5 crore and above . If it is a problem of a persistent nature , we have to start thinking why there is a cash flow problem and find out a plan so that that situation does not arise . It is a way to try and bring discipline . And there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bond market , nobody defaults even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the case of a loan from the banking system . And this is about term loans . For working capital loans , there is still a window of 30 days ( for repayment ) . For a term loan , every borrower knows on what day he has to pay and how much interest he has to pay . Cash flow has to be planned in a manner that you pay on the due date . <p> TT : So , is that indicative of wilful behaviour ? <p> A : Not wilful ... but sometimes when some leeway is available , it is being used . Once it is not available , they will start conforming . <p> TT : Let 's turn to the haircuts that banks are taking under the NCLT process . Reports suggest that these haircuts could range between 20 per cent to as high as 60-70 per cent or more . Bankers are taking a purely commercial decision on these cuts . But is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be issues relating to possible vigilance enquiries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation because they have to take commercial decisions and suffer losses in business . But we can not do away with the accountability . The decisions have to be viewed in good faith . But NCLT is a judicial process . There is greater comfort with the NCLT process because you try to work out all the options ... work out a resolution plan , go through a transparent bidding process . In an NCLT situation , where the judiciary is examining all the resolution plans and putting its stamp of approval or disapproval , that process will provide greater protection and comfort to the banks . But at times , outside the NCLT process , you can have enhanced recovery . But there is a fear that you could still be questioned . Banks would prefer that the decisions are taken by the NCLT process . Having said that , even outside NCLT process , whenever a decision is taken , it has to be documented properly and record the rationale behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now appointing committees of experts to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enterprise , we go through various price discovery mechanisms . Either we seek expressions of interest , advertise or float bids . Or we can even go for what is known as the Swiss challenge method where there is an anchor bid and , based on that , invite bids to better it . So , there are various options to ensure transparent price discovery . <p> TT : So why was n't a dynamic auction method considered as a price discovery method under the NCLT process ? <p> A : One difference between the IBC process and any other method is that it is a resolution process . This is not a recovery mechanism for the banks . That has to be clearly distinguished . It is not meant to only protect the interests of the financial creditors . IBC attempts to ensure that the enterprise should survive while protecting the various stakeholders -- financial creditors , suppliers , vendors , employees . The intent under IBC is continuity or survival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a potential bidder submits a resolution plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a debt of Rs 10,000 crore , I am offering Rs 5000 crore to the financial creditors and intend to bring in another Rs 4,000 crore as equity . There may be a situation where someone else says that he wants to pump in Rs 7,000 crore with no equity infusion . Now , that is where the evaluation comes in . There is a clearly defined evaluation matrix where 70 per cent of the weightage is based on the quantitative side : how much is offered to financial creditors , what are the terms of payments , how fast will it be paid . But nobody is looking at the other part and everybody is focused on the amount of haircut . That is what the media is also doing . No one is examining the qualitative aspects of the resolution . <p> TT : But as long as the money comes in , why should it matter to the lender who gets the asset ? Section 29A keeps the promoters out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are the guys who wrecked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the benefit of any haircut ? But if they are ready to pay back the entire liability and seek no recourse to a haircut , in such cases , do you think it is ethically fair to keep the promoter out ? <p> A : Section 29A says that if you are a defaulter for more than a year and then if you want to participate in the resolution process , pay and clear the overdues . I think it is a very fair and reasonable demand to make . Now the question arises , if somebody is saying that I am paying you , 100 per cent , then ( I will respond ) why did n't you pay 12 months back ? Why did you bring the enterprise and the bankers to this situation ? So , it is about intent also . But if they are not disqualified under section 29A , then the resolution plan can be worked out with the existing promoter . But if a resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you wo n't have to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NCLT ? That is because the existing promoter did not work out a resolution plan in the time given -- whether over a 24-month or a 36-month period . But now there is seriousness in the entire business . Now everybody will be more careful and the existing promoter has to come out of the mindset which existed prior to IBC that they have a fundamental birthright over an enterprise . You have a right of control over the enterprise till such time as you manage it well . If there is proof that you can not manage it well , then you can not continue to assert your fundamental right over the enterprise . That is the situation today and you need to accept that reality . <p> TT : A specific question : will you allow Arcelor Mittal to bid for Essar Steel ? <p> A : My answer to that question is that NCLT Ahmedabad has given an order . And we will abide by that order . Tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that order . If the Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that order . <p> TT : But the issue is that you may get conflicting orders from the various tribunals ? So , how do you reconcile seemingly inconsistent positions in the different cases ? <p> A : See , there is a case-specific order . So , the option before me is that if I am not satisfied with NCLT Ahmedabad bench 's order , then I can go to NCLAT . There is a process . But in this case , as of now , if the NCLT has given an order then let us abide by it . But this is still being debated in the CoC . No final decision has been taken . So , we have to wait for the outcome of the CoC decision . There are different points of view . Either we will abide by the order or , if the CoC decides not to do so , then it will appeal to the NCLAT and abide by the appellate tribunal 's order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then go the Supreme Court and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the outside is that everyone -- the RP , the CoC and the NCLT -- seems to be passing the buck . Nobody seems to want to take a decision . Would you care to comment ? <p> A : That is not how we see it . The responsibility on the RP and the CoC in the absence of the board of directors are clearly defined . The decision making rests with committee of creditors ( COC ) and resolution professional ( RP ) is in a way managing the asset during this period on behalf of the committee . Certain obligations are on the RP . For example , it is the RP 's job to determine whether an applicant is eligible or not to participate in the resolution process under the terms of section 29A . They do the investigation , carry out the due diligence on bidders , and tell the CoC in their view whether they are eligible or ineligible . There has to be a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretion of COC is where we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process . The evaluation criteria is circulated to the potential resolution applicants . Based on that evaluation , again it is the COC which has to decide who to choose and with whom to negotiate . The NCLT 's role is to approve the resolution . That way it is a very balanced structure . The RP is like some sort of an interim CEO plus some legal responsibilities . His role is to ensure that the value of the stressed does not erode . <p> TT : Credit growth last year was bad . This is happening at a time when the RBI has come out with a 7.4 per cent growth estimate for 2018-19 . So are you seeing a recovery possibility across all sectors or credit growth will happen in certain sectors ? <p> A : Credit growth is largely retail driven . But investment activity is starting to pick up , largely led by government and its spending on infrastructure . There are certain sectors where demand is coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not witnessing recovery in a big way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March . We have to see ... but situation seems to be much better than what it was earlier . I was looking at our numbers for April . You know , there is a decline in credit every April over the month of March . This time there is still a negative growth compared to March . But the year to date ( YTD ) growth or month to date ( MTD ) growth , the negative growth this year is much less than in the previous year . <p> TT : The RBI seems to have struck a hawkish tenor in its April monetary policy statement . In terms of interest rates , are you seeing rates starting to rise and , if so , when ? And what would be the impact on lending rates ? <p> A : There has been an uptick in government bond yields . That is a fact . We did revise our MCLR from March 1 . But right now I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . <p> TT : What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A : We would like to list all three subsidiaries -- SBI General , SBI Card , and the asset management arm ( SBI MF ) - next year . SBI Life had a great success as far as IPO and valuation is concerned . They rest are doing quite well . The SBI brand name is there , the trust factor is there . I am sure that market will give a good response . The market may not be giving good value to the SBI stock as of now but the subsidiaries , I am sure , will get good value . <p> TT : What about the plans for SBI Capital Markets ? <p> A : Basically , what we are doing is that the project finance division will be coming to the bank . In most of the banks , that activity is done by the bank and SBI Caps will focus on pure investment banking , alternate investment funds , merger and acquisition etc . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caps . SBI Caps is very strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the international distribution reach would be an ideal partner . We are working on issuing some sort of expression of interest ( EOI ) within next 6 months . I do n't mind offering a stake of anything between 26 and 49 per cent . We have not yet decided on how much to dilute in the other three subsidiaries . <p> TT : What about the merger process ? <p> Ans . Everything has been done very smoothly . Internally , the integration has been smooth . Customers did not face any issues . The benefits of merger will start flowing from this year . <p> TT : What about fresh recruitments ? <p> A : Every year there are 13,000-14000 retirements and because we have adopted technology in a big way , we do n't need to replace 100 per cent . But 70-75 per cent we still replace . That is needed . If we do n't do that , there will be shortage at mid-level management . Last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years , we had to face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuous process . The number of people working in the bank will start coming down but recruitments will take place every year . <p> TT : Let 's turn to digital banking . Did SBI sort of enter slightly late and what is the way forward ? <p> A : I do n't think we entered late . We usually start late by 6 month or 1 year in everything and sometimes , it is not necessarily a bad thing . There is a lot of thought process and we are governed by CVC regulations , so decision taking takes slightly longer . But it is not necessarily a bad thing . Digital initiatives in last 3-4 years have been tremendous . Digital is a very wide term . If we look from the consumer experience , Yono is best in class . It gives digital banking and all SBI products -- life insurance , general insurance , cards , mutual funds -- on a single platform and an online marketplace where all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , loan products will be available . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private cloud called Meghdoot . As per law , we can not have data that resides in a cloud outside India . We have undertaken three major projects in the last two years : Yono which is the front-end consumer platform , CRM , which is undergoing implementation that will conclude in next 3-6 months , and our award-winning risk management platform . A lot of projects relating to data analytics , block chain technology and artificial intelligence are in progress . <p> TT : Are there any risks or privacy issues ? <p> A : When you are dealing with data , cyber security has to be taken care of . When Yono was implemented even IT teams would many a times feel frustrated because they will not get the security clearance . It has become dynamic . You have to keep on anticipating what can go wrong . We are using sophisticated cyber security technology . But that is something where you can not say and announce . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and involve expert agencies . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crypto currencies in India . But how do you see this game play out in the future ? Can you have physical currency co-existing with digital currency ? <p> A : I think the future is in crypto currencies . Its time has come . The RBI itself has said that they are setting up a taskforce on the subject . Sooner or later , digital currency will gain currency . The only thing is to find ways to regulate it . That will be a big challenge . In my view , that is going to be the future . The monetary policies of central banks around the world will have to look into aspects like how to control , manage and measure ( crypto currencies ) . That 's what is in the domain of task force . We are moving very fast in the connected world and e-commerce has started to become prominent . So , I feel its time has come . <p> TT : The window for electoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time within a month . What has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do not have enough data on the issuances . <p> A : It is a new experiment . We have devised this product in a way that it is 100 per cent compliant with the requirements of law or regulation . It may take a little more time before it becomes popular . Figures given by the finance minister in the parliament that bonds worth about Rs 220 crore were sold and , as the election year approaches , it will be in demand . We have ensured that we are compliant with KYC and prevention of money laundering ( PML ) guidelines . We are also ensuring the anonymity of the donor . It is not something that has just come off the shelf . So that 's why government decided that SBI would do the job . Earlier the plan was to sell the electoral bonds in the first 10 days of every quarter . This time because of the Karnataka elections , the government has decided to open the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July and October and , when there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 days . So far wherever we sold the bonds , the process has been smooth . <p> TT : The cost of ATM maintenance is rising . Are you taking on a cost which is a social cost ? <p> A : It is not a social cost , but it is a cost of doing business . I have 43 crore customers . Our savings bank franchise is very strong . In March , our saving bank deposits have crossed Rs 10 lakh crore . People will need to deposit or withdraw cash . They will come either to the branch or the ATM . One channel is not enough to serve such a huge base . The ATM channel is cheaper than the branch channel . The per transaction cost at ATM is 1/4th that of the branch . The only problem is if my customer uses another bank 's ATM because then I have to pay Rs 17 for that transaction and I can not recover it from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cheapest . Out of every 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And more than 40 are digital transactions . <p> TT : Do you think there is a case now for consolidation of public sector banks ? <p> A : Maybe , we do not need 21 PSU banks . There may be scope for consolidation for sure . It is a question of timing . When do you do it ? If you try to consolidate when all the banks are struggling , there will be a problem . Once they overcome the situation and are in a much healthier situation , then consolidation can be thought of . <p> TT : One final question : what is your vision for the bank that you wish to execute during your three-year tenure ? <p> A : The immediate challenge is to improve asset quality . But at the end of three years , the bank should emerge much stronger financially . The valuation of the bank should reflect its true value , which I believe as on date , it does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We need to upgrade the skills of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to training system which is in for a major overhaul . The process has started . Third , is leadership of the bank in the area of technology with the purpose to increase productivity , lower cost to income ratio which will have an impact on the financials . Ideally , I would like to see SBI recognised as a global leader in banking innovation . <p> Glossary <p> SDR ( Strategic Debt Restructuring ) : Debt resolution plan that involved a change in ownership of the indebted enterprise . The joint lenders forum was obliged to convert the whole or part of the loan into equity shares within 30 days from the review of the account . The plan needed the approval of a majority of the members of the joint lenders forum ( a minimum of 75 per cent of creditors by value and 60 per cent of creditors by number ) . <p> S4A or Scheme for Sustainable Structuring of Stressed Assets ( S4A Scheme ) : A debt resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken up into two parts : Part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing free cash flows ) with the rest is classified as Part B. <p> 5/25 scheme : This scheme enabled banks to extend long-term loans of up to 25 years to match the cash flow of projects while refinancing them every five years . It was designed to ensure long term viability of infrastructure/core industries sector projects by smoothening the cash flow stress in initial years . <p> MCLR ( Marginal cost of funds-based lending rate ) : This is a standard lending rate below which a bank is not allowed to give loans except to some priority sectors . This lending rate varies from bank to bank as it depends on four factors : marginal cost of funds , the negative carry on account of the cash reserve ratio ( CRR ) , operating costs , and the tenure of the loan . The MCLR regime was introduced on April 1 , 2016 . Banks have had to link their base rate on old loans to the MCLR from April 1 , @"
"<h> Co-Inventor Of Random Forest , Adele Cutler , Talks At Rising 2020 <h> Read Next <p> For the penultimate talk of Day 1 , Analytics India Magazine is pleased to have Adele Cutler at the second edition of Rising conference . Dr Cutler is one of the key people behind the Random Forest algorithm . She along with her doctoral advisor , Leo Breiman worked on the development of random forests three decades ago . She and Breiman released the original code for Random Forests and also created the first interface to R. Other works include Archetypal Analysis ( 1994 ) . <p> The talk began with an introduction of her co-inventor Leo Breiman and the timeline of Random Forests . <p> Dr Cutler introduced the virtual audience to the intuition behind Random Forest and how it came into being . She demonstrated this by taking the examples of classification and regression trees(CART) and then went on to explain their disadvantages and how Random Forests come to the rescue . <p> She explained the advantages of Random Forests over CART , in terms of accuracy and instability . Even if there is a little change in the data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more stable because it is a combination of many trees . <p> In case of accuracy , Random Forests is competitive with the best known machine learning methods . <p> She also spoke about the tradeoffs of using Random Forest over the latest approaches such as Deep Learning . She admitted that Random Forests might not be as accurate as deep learning methods for tasks such as image recognition . However , in many other tasks , the improvements offered by current state of the art algorithms is only infinitesimal when compared to Random Forests . <p> Sharing few experiences from her career that spanned over three decades , she spoke about the involvement of women in algorithmic development . She said that the numbers are underwhelming when compared to statistics , which features more women . Dr Cutler 's talk was followed by a deluge of good questions by the attendees . She tried her best to answer all within the limited time"
"<h> States <h> Leisure <h> The Telegraph <h> The post-text future is here <h> You read that right . It 's time to make way for sounds and pictures , says Farhad Manjoo <p> Apr 23 , 2018 00:00 IST <p> I 'll make this short : reading prose on a screen is going out of fashion . We 're taking stock of the Internet right now , with writers who cover the digital world cataloguing some of the most consequential currents shaping it , and one truth becomes clear . The defining narrative of our online moment concerns the decline of text , and the exploding reach and power of audio and video . <p> This multimedia Internet has been gaining on the text-based Internet for years . But last year , the story accelerated sharply , and now audio and video are unstoppable . The most influential communicators online once worked on webpages and blogs . They 're now making podcasts , Netflix shows , propaganda memes , Instagram and YouTube channels , and apps like HQ Trivia . <p> Consider the most compelling digital innovations now emerging : the talking assistants , Apple 's face-reading phone , artificial intelligence to search photos or translate spoken language , and augmented reality - which inserts any digital image into a live view of your surroundings . Together , they 're all sending us the same message : Welcome to the post-text future . <p> The Internet was born in text because text was once the only format computers understood . Then we started giving machines eyes and ears - that is , smartphones were invented - and now we 've provided them brains to decipher and manipulate multimedia . Suddenly the script flipped : now it 's often easier to communicate with machines through images and sounds than text . <p> It 's more than just talking to digital assistants . Artificial intelligence might soon let us search and index much of the world 's repository of audio and video , giving sounds and pictures a power that has kept text dominant online for so long . <p> Tech did n't just make multimedia easier to produce . It also democratised non-text formats , which for so long had been accessible only to studios . Podcasting became the new blogging , a way for committed amateurs and obsessives to plumb the underexplored eddies and mysteries of life . <p> Meanwhile , social media showered every multimedia creator with a potential audience , and allowed the audience to connect and discuss the work , deepening fans ' relationship to obsession . <p> It 's a kind of passion that ultimately makes for a fundamentally new , deeper kind of art . Look at all the room the Internet opened up for crazy mash-ups of ideas . Netflix 's best recent show , American Vandal , is a parody of Serial , the true-crime podcast , and Making a Murderer , another Netflix show . <p> The haze of misinformation hanging over online life will only darken under multimedia - think of your phone as a Hollywood-grade visual-effects studio that could be used to make anyone appear to say or do anything . The ability to search audio and video as easily text means , effectively , the end of any private space . <p> Then there 's the more basic question of how pictures and sounds alter how we think . An information system dominated by pictures and sounds prizes emotion over rationality . It 's a world where slogans and memes have more sticking power than arguments . ( Remind you of anyone ? ) And will someone please think of the children : do you know how much power YouTube has over your kids ? Are you afraid to find out ? <p> But what are we going to do ? There seems no going back now . For text , the writing is on the wall ."

( Source : PTI ) <p> Finance Minister Arun Jaitley presented his last Union Budget this year , announcing changes in the healthcare sector , long term capital gains tax , corporate tax and the custom duty on a slew of import items . The message was clear - the government is looking to uplift the poor , senior and rural sections of the country . <p> Madam , four years ago , we pledged to the people of India to give this nation an honest , clean and transparent Government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restoring strong performance of Indian economy . We promised to reduce poverty , expedite infrastructure creation and build a strong , confident and a New India . When our Government took over , India was considered a part of fragile 5 ; a nation suffering from policy paralysis and corruption . We have decisively reversed this . The Government , led by Prime Minister , Shri Narendra Modi , has successfully implemented a series of fundamental structural reforms . With the result , India stands out among the fastest growing economies of the world . <p> The journey of economic reforms during the past few years has been challenging but rewarding . As a result of the reforms undertaken by the Government , foreign direct investment has gone up . Measures taken by the Government have made it much easier to do business in India . Natural resources are now allocated in a transparent and honest manner . There is a premium on honesty . There was a time when corruption was commonplace . Today , our people , especially our youths , are curious to lead their lives honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Services Tax , has been made simpler . Benefits to the poor have been targeted more effectively with use of digital technology . The demonetization of high value currency has reduced the quantum of cash currency and circulation in India . It has increased the taxation base and spurred greater digitization of the economy . The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code ( IBC ) has changed the lender-debtor relationship . The recapitalized banks will now have a greater ability to support growth . All these structural reforms in the medium and long run will help Indian economy achieve stronger growth for a long time . <p> Indian economy has performed very well since our Government took over in May , 2014 . India achieved an average growth of 7.5% in first three years of our Government . Indian economy is now 2.5 trillion dollar economy -- seventh largest in the world . India is expected to become the fifth largest economy very soon . On Purchasing Power Parity ( PPP ) basis , we are already the third largest economy . <p> Indian society , polity and economy had shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth at 6.3% in the second quarter signaled turnaround of the economy . We hope to grow at 7.2% to 7.5% in the second half . IMF , in its latest Update , has forecast that India will grow at 7.4% next year . Manufacturing sector is back on good growth path . The services , mainstay of our growth , have also resumed their high growth rates of 8% plus . Our exports are expected to grow at 15% in 2017-18 . We are now firmly on course to achieve high growth of 8% plus . <p> We have taken up programmes to direct the benefits of structural changes and good growth to reach farmers , poor and other vulnerable sections of our society and to uplift the under-developed regions . This year 's Budget will consolidate these gains and particularly focus on strengthening agriculture and rural economy , provision of good health care to economically less privileged , taking care of senior citizens , infrastructure creation and working with the States to provide more resources for improving the quality of education in the country . <p> Prime Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has articulated the vision of ' ' Minimum Government and Maximum Governance ' ' . This vision has inspired Government agencies in carrying out hundreds of reforms in policies , rules and procedures . This transformation is reflected in improvement of India 's ranking by 42 places in last three years in the World Bank 's ' Ease of Doing Business ' with India breaking into top 100 for the first time . I would like to congratulate all those who worked to achieve this . <p> Now , our Government has taken Ease of Doing business further by stress on ' Ease of Leaving ' for the common men of this country , especially for those belonging to poor &amp; middle class of the society . Good governance also aims at minimum interference by the government in the life of common people of the country . <p> Government is providing free LPG connections to the poor of this country through Ujjwala Yojana . Under Saubhagya Yojna 4 crore household are being provided with electricity connections . More than 800 medicines are being sold at lower price through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stents have been controlled . Special scheme for free dialysis of poor have been initiated . Persons belonging to poor and middle class are also being provided a great relief in interest rates on housing schemes . Efforts are being made to provide all government services , whether bus or train tickets or individual certificates on line . These include passports which may be delivered at doorstep in two or three days or Company registration in one day time and these facilities have benefited a large section of our country . Certificate attestation is not mandatory , interviews for appointment in Group C and Group D posts have been done away with . These measures have saved time and money of lakhs of our youth . Our Government by using modern technology is committed to provide a relief to those who suffer because of rigid rules and regulations . <p> Madam , while undertaking these reforms and programmes , we have worked sincerely and without weighing the political costs . Our Government has ensured that benefits reach eligible beneficiaries and are delivered to them directly . Many services and benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their accounts . It has reduced corruption and cost of delivery and has eliminated middlemen in the process . Direct Benefit Transfer mechanism of India is the biggest such exercise in the world and is a global success story . <p> Section II - Investment , Expenditure and Policy Initiatives <p> My Government is committed for the welfare of farmers . For decades , country 's agriculture policy and programme had remained production centric . We have sought to effect a paradigm shift . Honourable Prime Minister gave a clarion call to double farmers ' income by 2022 when India celebrates its 75th year of independence . Our emphasis is on generating higher incomes for farmers . We consider agriculture as an enterprise and want to help farmers produce more from the same land parcel at lesser cost and simultaneously realize higher prices for their produce . Our emphasis is also on generating productive and gainful on-farm and non-farm employment for the farmers and landless families . <p> Madam Speaker , as a result of the hard work of our country 's farmers agriculture production in our country is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieved a record food grain production of around 275 million tonnes and around 300 million tonnes of fruits and vegetables . <p> Madam Speaker , in our party 's manifesto it has been stated that the farmers should realize at least 50 per cent more than the cost of their produce , in other words , one and a half times of the cost of their production . Government have been very much sensitive to this resolutions and it has declared Minimum support price ( MSP ) for the majority of rabi crops at least at one and a half times the cost involved . Now , we have decided to implement this resolution as a principle for the rest of crops . I am pleased to announce that as per pre-determined principle , Government has decided to keep MSP for the all unannounced crops of kharif at least at one and half times of their production cost . I am confident that this historic decision will prove an important step towards doubling the income of our farmers . <p> Our Government works with the holistic approach of solving any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate and it is more important that farmers should get full benefit of the announced MSP . For this , it is essential that if price of the agriculture produce market is less than MSP , then in that case Government should purchase either at MSP or work in a manner to provide MSP for the farmers through some other mechanism . Niti Ayog , in consultation with Central and State Governments , will put in place a fool-proof mechanism so that farmers will get adequate price for their produce . <p> For better price realization , farmers need to make decisions based on prices likely to be available after its harvest . Government will create an institutional mechanism , with participation of all concerned Ministries , to develop appropriate policies and practices for price and demand forecast , use of futures and options market , expansion of warehouse depository system and to take decisions about specific exports and imports related measures . <p> Madam Speaker , last year , I had announced strengthening of e-NAM and to expand coverage of e-NAM to 585 APMCs. 470 APMCs have been connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2018 . <p> More than 86% of our farmers are small and marginal . They are not always in a position to directly transact at APMCs and other wholesale markets . We will develop and upgrade existing 22,000 rural haats into Gramin Agricultural Markets ( GrAMs ) . In these GrAMs , physical infrastructure will be strengthened using MGNREGA and other Government Schemes . These GrAMs , electronically linked to e-NAM and exempted from regulations of APMCs , will provide farmers facility to make direct sale to consumers and bulk purchasers . <p> An Agri-Market Infrastructure Fund with a corpus of 2000 crore will be set up for developing and upgrading agricultural marketing infrastructure in the 22000 Grameen Agricultural Markets ( GrAMs ) and 585 APMCs . <p> Task of connecting all eligible habitations with an all-weather road has been substantially completed , with the target date brought forward to March , 2019 from March 2022 . It is now time to strengthen and widen its ambit further to include major link routes which connect habitations to agricultural and rural markets ( GrAMs ) , higher secondary schools and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include such linkages . <p> For several years , we have been stating that India is primarily an agriculture based country . As India is primarily an agriculture based country , our districts can specialize in some or other agricultural produce and be known for it . But special attention is lacking in this regard . There is a need to develop cluster based model in a scientific manner for identified agriculture produces in our districts in the same manner as we have developed model for industrial sector . <p> Cultivation of horticulture crops in clusters bring advantages of scales of operations and can spur establishment of entire chain from production to marketing , besides giving recognition to the districts for specific crops . The Ministry of Agriculture &amp; Farmers ' Welfare will reorient its ongoing Schemes and promote cluster based development of agricommodities and regions in partnership with the Ministries of Food Processing , Commerce and other allied Ministries . <p> Our Government has promoted organic farming in a big way . Organic farming by Farmer Producer Organizations ( FPOs ) and Village Producers ' Organizations ( VPOs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be encouraged . Women Self Help Groups ( SHGs ) will also be encouraged to take up organic agriculture in clusters under National Rural Livelihood Programme . <p> Our ecology supports cultivation of highly specialized medicinal and aromatic plants . India is also home to a large number of small and cottage industries that manufacture perfumes , essential oils and other associated products . Our Government shall support organized cultivation and associated industry . I propose to allocate a sum of 200 crore for this purpose . <p> Food Processing sector is growing at an average rate of 8% per annum . Prime Minister Krishi Sampada Yojana is our flagship programme for boosting investment in food processing . Allocation of Ministry of Food Processing is being doubled from 715 crore in RE 2017-18 to 1400 crore in BE 2018-19 . Government will promote establishment of specialized agro-processing financial institutions in this sector . <p> Tomato , onion and potato are basic vegetables consumed throughout the year . However , seasonal and regional production of these perishable commodities pose a challenge in connecting farmers and consumers in a manner that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Operation Greens ' ' on the lines of ' ' Operation Flood ' ' . ' ' Operation Greens ' ' shall promote Farmer Producers Organizations ( FPOs ) , agri-logistics , processing facilities and professional management . I propose to allocate a sum of 500 crore for this purpose . <p> India 's agri-exports potential is as high as US $ 100 billion against current exports of US $ 30 billion . To realize this potential , export of agri-commodities will be liberalized . I also propose to set up state-ofthe-art testing facilities in all the forty two Mega Food Parks . <p> I propose to extend the facility of Kisan Credit Cards to fisheries and animal husbandry farmers to help them meet their working capital needs . Small and marginal farmers will get more benefits . <p> Bamboo is ' Green Gold ' . We removed bamboo grown outside forest areas from the definition of trees . Now , I propose to launch a Re-structured National Bamboo Mission with an outlay of 1290 crore to promote bamboo sector in a holistic manner . <p> Many farmers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of solar electricity is harvesting of Sun by the farmers using their lands . Government of India will take necessary measures and encourage State Governments to put in place a mechanism that their surplus solar power is purchased by the distribution companies or licencees at reasonably remunerative rates . <p> Our Government set up a Long Term Irrigation Fund ( LTIF ) in NABARD for meeting funding requirement of irrigation works . Scope of the Fund would be expanded to cover specified command area development projects . <p> Last year , I had announced setting up of Micro Irrigation Fund ( MIF ) for facilitating expansion of coverage under micro irrigation and Dairy Processing Infrastructure Development Fund ( DPIDF ) to help finance investment in dairying infrastructure . It is now time to expand such focused investment Funds . I , now , announce setting up a Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund ( FAIDF ) for fisheries sector and an Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund ( AHIDF ) for financing infrastructure requirement of animal husbandry sector . Total Corpus of these two new Funds would be 10,000 crore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutional credit for agriculture sector from year-to-year from 8.5 lakh crore in 2014-15 to 10 lakh crore in 2017-18 . I now propose to raise this to 11 lakh crore for the year 2018-19 . <p> Presently , lessee cultivators are not able to avail crop loans . Consequently , a significant proportion of arable land remains fallow and tenant cultivators are forced to secure credit from usurious money lenders . NITI Aayog , in consultation with State Governments , will evolve a suitable mechanism to enable access of lessee cultivators to credit without compromising the rights of the land owners . <p> Air pollution in the Delhi-NCR region has been a cause of concern . A special Scheme will be implemented to support the efforts of the governments of Haryana , Punjab , Uttar Pradesh and the NCT of Delhi to address air pollution and to subsidize machinery required for insitu management of crop residue . <p> Madam Speaker , the present top leadership of this country has reached at this level after seeing poverty at close quarters . Our leadership is familiar with the problems being faced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections of the society . People belonging to poor and middle class are not case studies for them , on the other hand they themselves are case study . <p> The Lower and Middle Class have been the focus of our Government during the last three years . This Government is continuously striving to alleviate all the small and major problems of the poor . <p> We launched Prime Minister 's Ujjwala Scheme to make poor women free from the smoke of wood . Initially our target was to provide free LPG connections to about 5 crore poor women . But in view of the pace of implementation of Ujjwala scheme and its popularity among the women , we propose to increase the target of providing free connection to 8 crore poor women . <p> Our Government has launched Prime Minister Saubhagya Yojana for providing electricity to all households of the country . Under this scheme , four crores poor households are being provided with electricity connection free of charge . We are spending 16000 crore under this scheme . You can very well imagine our anxiety and restlessness even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and children whose houses will not get electricity . Their life is going to change because of Pradhan Mantri Saubhagya Yojana . <p> Swachh Bharat Mission has benefited the poor . Under this mission , Government has already constructed more than 6 crore toilets . The positive effect of these toilets is being seen on the dignity of ladies , education of girls and the overall health of family . Government is planning to construct around 2 crore toilets . <p> Madam Speaker , a roof for his family is another concern of the poor . Far from the Benami properties earned by corruption , the poor only desire to have a roof , a small house by his earning of honesty . Our Govt. is helping them so that they may fulfil the dream of their own house . We have fixed a target that every poor of this country may have his own house by 2022 . For this purpose Prime Minister Awas Yojana has been launched in rural and urban areas of the country . Under Prime Minister Awas Scheme Rural , 51 lakhs houses in year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one crore houses will be constructed exclusively in rural areas . In urban areas the assistance has been sanctioned to construct 37 lakh houses . <p> My Government will also establish a dedicated Affordable Housing Fund ( AHF ) in National Housing Bank , funded from priority sector lending shortfall and fully serviced bonds authorized by the Government of India . 43 . Loans to Self Help Groups of women increased to about Rupees 42,500 crore in 2016-17 , growing 37% over previous year . The Government is confident that loans to SHGs will increase to 75,000 crore by March , 2019 . I propose to substantially increase allocation of National Rural Livelihood Mission to 5750 crore in 2018-19 . <p> Ground water irrigation scheme under Prime Minister Krishi Sinchai Yojna- Har Khet ko Pani will be taken up in 96 deprived irrigation districts where less than 30% of the land holdings gets assured irrigation presently . I have allocated 2600 crore for this purpose . <p> As my proposals outlined indicate , focus of the Government next year will be on providing maximum livelihood opportunities in the rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities and construction of rural infrastructure . In the year 2018-19 , for creation of livelihood and infrastructure in rural areas , total amount to be spent by the Ministries will be 14.34 lakh crore , including extra-budgetary and non-budgetary resources of 11.98 lakh crore . Apart from employment due to farming activities and self employment , this expenditure will create employment of 321 crore person days , 3.17 lakh kilometers of rural roads , 51 lakh new rural houses , 1.88 crore toilets , and provide 1.75 crore new household electric connections besides boosting agricultural growth . Details are in Annexure I. Health , Education and Social Protection <p> My Government 's goal is to assist and provide opportunity to every Indian to realize her full potential capable of achieving her economic and social dreams . Our Government is implementing a comprehensive social security and protection programme to reach every household of old , widows , orphaned children , divyaang and deprived as per the Socio-Economic Caste Census . Allocation on National Social Assistance Programme this year has been kept at 9975 crore . <p> We have managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a cause of serious concern . We have now defined learning outcomes and National Survey of more than 20 lakh children has been conducted to assess the status on the ground . This will help in devising a district-wise strategy for improving quality of education . We now propose to treat education holistically without segmentation from pre-nursery to Class 12 . <p> Improvement in quality of teachers can improve the quality of education in the country . We will initiate an integrated B.Ed . programme for teachers . Training of teachers during service is extremely critical . We have amended the Right to Education Act to enable more than 13 lakh untrained teachers to get trained . <p> Technology will be the biggest driver in improving the quality of education . We propose to increase the digital intensity in education and move gradually from ' ' black board ' ' to ' ' digital board ' ' . Technology will also be used to upgrade the skills of teachers through the recently launched digital portal ' ' DIKSHA ' ' . <p> The Government is committed to provide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment . To realise this mission , it has been decided that by the year 2022 , every block with more than 50% ST population and at least 20,000 tribal persons , will have an Ekalavya Model Residential School . Ekalavya schools will be on par with Navodaya Vidyalayas and will have special facilities for preserving local art and culture besides providing training in sports and skill development . <p> To step up investments in research and related infrastructure in premier educational institutions , including health institutions , I propose to launch a major initiative named ' ' Revitalising Infrastructure and Systems in Education ( RISE ) by 2022 ' ' with a total investment of 1,00,000 crore in next four years . Higher Education Financing Agency ( HEFA ) would be suitably structured for funding this initiative . <p> Our Government has taken major initiative of setting up Institutes of Eminence . There has been tremendous response to this initiative by institutions both in public and private sectors . We have received more than 100 applications . We have also taken steps to set up a specialized Railways University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new full-fledged Schools of Planning and Architecture , to be selected on challenge mode . Additionally , 18 new SPAs would be established in the IITs and NITs as autonomous Schools , also on challenge mode . <p> The Government would launch the ' ' Prime Minister 's Research Fellows ( PMRF ) ' ' Scheme this year . Under this , we would identify 1,000 best B.Tech students each year from premier institutions and provide them facilities to do Ph.D in IITs and IISc , with a handsome fellowship . It is expected that these bright young fellows would voluntarily commit few hours every week for teaching in higher educational institutions . <p> Now I come to the Health Sector . Only Swasth Bharat can be a Samriddha Bharat . India can not realize its demographic dividend without its citizens being healthy . <p> I am pleased to announce two major initiatives as part of ' ' Ayushman Bharat ' ' programme aimed at making path breaking interventions to address health holistically , in primary , secondary and tertiary care system covering both prevention and health promotion . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wellness Centres as the foundation of India 's health system . These 1.5 lakh centres will bring health care system closer to the homes of people . These centres will provide comprehensive health care , including for noncommunicable diseases and maternal and child health services . These centres will also provide free essential drugs and diagnostic services . I am committing 1200 crore in this budget for this flagship programme . I also invite contribution of private sector through CSR and philanthropic institutions in adopting these centres . <p> Madam Speaker , we are all aware that lakhs of families in our country have to borrow or sell assets to receive indoor treatment in hospitals . Government is seriously concerned about such impoverishment of poor and vulnerable families . Present Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana ( RSBY ) provide annual coverage of only 30,000 to poor families . Several State Governments have also implemented/supplemented health protection schemes providing varying coverage . My Government has now decided to take health protection to more aspirational level . <p> We will launch a flagship National Health Protection Scheme to cover over 10 crore poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coverage upto 5 lakh rupees per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization . This will be the world 's largest government funded health care programme . Adequate funds will be provided for smooth implementation of this programme . <p> Madam Speaker , these two far-reaching initiatives under the Ayushman Bharat will build a New India 2022 and ensure enhanced productivity , well being and avert wage loss and impoverishment . These Schemes will also generate lakhs of jobs , particularly for women . The Government is steadily but surely progressing towards the goal of Universal Health Coverage . <p> TB claims more lives every year than any other infectious disease . It affects mainly poor and malnourished people . My Government has , therefore , decided to allocate additional 600 crore to provide nutritional support to all TB patients at the rate of 500 per month for the duration of their treatment . <p> In order to further enhance accessibility of quality medical education and health care , we will be setting up 24 new Government Medical Colleges and Hospitals by upgrading existing district hospitals in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 Medical College for every 3 Parliamentary Constituencies and at least 1 Government Medical College in each State of the country . <p> Our resolve of making our villages open defecation free is aimed at improving the life of our villagers . We will launch a Scheme called Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources Dhan ( GOBAR-DHAN ) for management and conversion of cattle dung and solid waste in farms to compost , fertilizer , bio-gas and bio-CNG . <p> Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Beema Yojana ( PMJJBY ) has benefitted 5.22 crore families with a life insurance cover of 2 lakh on payment of a premium of only 330/- per annum . Likewise , under Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana , 13 crore 25 lakh persons have been insured with personal accident cover of 2 lakh on payment of a premium of only 12 per annum . The Government will work to cover all poor households , including SC/ST households , under these in a mission mode . <p> The Government will expand the coverage under Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana by bringing all sixty crore basic accounts within its fold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unorganized sector pension schemes through these accounts . <p> Our commitment towards ' ' Beti Bachao Beti Padhao ' ' is unflinching . Sukanya Samriddhi Account Scheme launched in January 2015 has been a great success . Until November , 2017 more than 1.26 crore accounts have been opened across the country in the name of girlchild securing an amount of 19,183 crore . <p> Cleaning the Ganga is work of national importance and it is our firm commitment . Members will be happy to learn that this work has gathered speed . A total of 187 projects have been sanctioned under the Namami Gange programme for infrastructure development , river surface cleaning , rural sanitation and other interventions at a cost of 16,713 crore. 47 projects have been completed and remaining projects are at various stages of execution . All 4465 Ganga Grams -- villages on the bank of river - have been declared open defecation free . <p> To give focused attention and to achieve our vision of an inclusive society , the Government has identified 115 aspirational districts taking various indices of development in consideration . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ districts by investing in social services like health , education , nutrition , skill upgradation , financial inclusion and infrastructure like irrigation , rural electrification , potable drinking water and access to toilets at an accelerated pace and in a time bound manner . We expect these 115 districts to become model of development . <p> Economic and social advancement of hard working people of Scheduled Castes ( SCs ) and Scheduled Tribes ( STs ) has received core attention of Government . Our Government increased total earmarked allocation for SCs in 279 programmes from 34,334 crore in 2016-17 to 52,719 crore in RE 2017-18 . Likewise , for STs , earmarked allocation was increased from 21,811 crore in 2016-17 to 32,508 crore in RE 2017-18 in 305 programmes . I propose an earmarked allocation of 56,619 crore for SCs and 39,135 crore for STs in BE 2018-19 . <p> Government 's estimated schematic budgetary expenditure on health , education and social protection for 2018-19 is 1.38 lakh crore against estimated expenditure of 1.22 lakh crore in BE 2017-18 . Details are in Annexure II . This expenditure is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of additional allocation during the year and extra budgetary expenditure , including through Higher Education Financing Agency . <p> Medium , Small and Micro Enterprises ( MSMEs ) and Employment <p> Medium , Small and Micro Enterprises ( MSMEs ) are a major engine of growth and employment in the country . I have provided 3794 crore to MSME Sector for giving credit support , capital and interest subsidy and innovations . Massive formalization of the businesses of MSMEs is taking place in the country after demonetization and introduction of GST . This is generating enormous financial information database of MSMEs ' businesses and finances . This big data base will be used for improving financing of MSMEs ' capital requirement , including working capital . <p> It is proposed to onboard public sector banks and corporates on Trade Electronic Receivable Discounting System ( TReDS ) platform and link this with GSTN . Online loan sanctioning facility for MSMEs will be revamped for prompt decision making by the banks . Government will soon announce measures for effectively addressing non-performing assets and stressed accounts of MSMEs . This will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow challenges faced by them . In order to reduce tax burden on MSMEs and to create larger number of jobs , I will be announcing some tax measures in Part B of my speech . <p> MUDRA Yojana launched in April , 2015 has led to sanction of 4.6 lakh crore in credit from 10.38 crore MUDRA loans . 76% of loan accounts are of women and more than 50% belong to SCs , STs and OBCs . It is proposed to set a target of 3 lakh crore for lending under MUDRA for 2018-19 after having successfully exceeded the targets in all previous years . <p> Non-Bank Finance Companies ( NBFCs ) stepped up financing of MSMEs after demonetization . NBFCs can be very powerful vehicle for delivering loans under MUDRA . Refinancing policy and eligibility criteria set by MUDRA will be reviewed for better refinancing of NBFCs . <p> Use of Fintech in financing space will help growth of MSMEs . A group in the Ministry of Finance is examining the policy and institutional development measures needed for creating right environment for Fintech companies to grow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need an innovative and special developmental and regulatory regime for their growth .

"<p> Using a combination of artificial intelligence ( AI ) and brain scanning technology , a team of researchers has developed a novel method that can help remove specific fears from the brain . <p> The new technique that could read and identify a fear memory can pave way of treating patients with conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) and phobias , the study said . <p> Neuroscientists , from the University of Tokyo , developed ' Decoded Neurofeedback ' -- which used brain scanning to monitor activity in the brain , and identify complex patterns of activity that resembled a specific fear memory . <p> In the study , the team included 17 healthy volunteers in whom a fear memory was created by administering a brief electric shock when they saw a certain computer image . <p> Using brain scanner , the researchers monitored the volunteers ' mental activity and were able to spot signs of that specific fear memory .

"<h> Article : Taking a stock of the future of work <h> Taking a stock of the future of work <p> Both technological and economic forces are pushing companies to rapidly adapt to newer ways of engaging with their ecosystem . But such shifts come with their own set of changes , and challenges , to modern day workspaces . <p> Much of the expected labor shifts have already begun reshaping skill set preferences and talent demands , making many people who do n't possess the right skills , completely obsolete in contributing towards the growth of the company . <p> A key strategy for businesses over the last few decades has been to be able to accurately predict the future and take proactive steps in accordance with incoming changes . This ' staying ahead of the curve ' as it was , has had a slow process evolution and acceptance within the larger business community . And not without its own reasons . Our understanding of how one economic parameter impacts the other in today 's globalized world has far improved and technology today perhaps has a strong claim to be more disruptive today than any time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly changing , many reactively to keep up with the ebb of time . Traditional parameters of exchange and interaction between the business and its stakeholders have rapidly evolved and the future of work remains no exception to this . While developed economies have already begun facing mass restructuring in how jobs are accessed , developing countries like India , with their own ever-growing working population stands at the cusp of pivotal changes within its labor markets . Much of such expected labor shifts have already begun reshaping skill set preferences and talent demands , making many people who do n't possess the right skills , completely obsolete in contributing towards the growth of the company . <p> This has , in turn , spurred the need for reskilling programs , both undertaken by the company or through public means . For companies , it means focusing on learning and training paradigms of not just new recruits but also for those who have been ' in this line of business ' for decades . And the trend is only projected to rise in the coming years . <h> Forces driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a transaction cost theory of firm growth1 . To summarise its understanding of labor policies and expanding company , the theory put forward a simple transactional analysis to take decisions of either retrenchment or expansion . If internal cost -- the cost of undertaking a specialized operation within the company -- remains lower than external costs , the firm should expand and ensure such a task is performed in-house . On the flipside , if external costs go down , it becomes important for firms to outsource rather than spend more on completing the task in-house . Although a rudimentary explanation of the theory from a time quite different to the one we live in today , it helps to understand the current state of the economic change the business market is undergoing today . And , in turn , how jobs within certain fields are diminishing or evolving because of such changes . <p> With the increased access to technology and its open and decentralized usage , today , a number of business functions are beginning to emerge for whom external costs become relatively cheaper than internal costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are slowly but surely chipping away traditional job roles and are providing companies a cheaper and more efficient way of undertaking such roles , usually providing a disruptive tech-dependent solution . The major uses of automation , machine learning , and robotics today all fall under this role . <p> Market trends show how many core functions within a modern day company like finance or management , have had key parts automated or outsourced to be handled by a more efficient service provider . This fall in external costs , driven by growing access , and understanding of what technology can do , is projected to rise further in the coming years . With reports2 showing how globally , 64 percent of companies cite labor costs as their main concern , aspects like gig economy are on the rise . <h> Assessing the current impact <p> The rise of tech adoption and the consequent evolution of the business ecosystem could result in many companies shortening their in-house staff and job roles evolving to take on more transformational and creative angles as many traditional roles either become obsolete or end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shift in job roles by significantly bringing down firms operating external costs , but are also redefining such roles in a more direct manner . Today , almost all companies are mandated to have a digital presence . Most also employ digital technologies liberally across both their internal- and external-facing functions to improve their efficacy . Other aspects such as big data analytics and cloud computing are changing how jobs operate and interact with each other . <p> The number of hours spent by humans on particular tasks is expected to go down in the next five years as machines and programs begin to do much of the heavy lifting when it comes to transactional and often routine-based activities . <p> Tech profiles like cybersecurity and the ability to work with nuanced programs like machine learning and blockchain are slowly growing in importance . Geographical proximity has no longer remained an important consideration and businesses have actively begun changing their talent priorities to attract the people with the most relevant skill sets . Even office workspaces are currently charting their own journey towards catering to companies which operate on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the WEF report on the Future of Jobs , there were "" four specific technological advances -- ubiquitous high-speed mobile internet ; artificial intelligence ; widespread adoption of big data analytics ; and cloud technology -- that are set to dominate the 2018 -- 2022 period as drivers positively affecting business growth "" . <h> Where is this impact being felt ? <p> Despite an increase in total employment , on an average , 1 in 7 individual workers will be faced with job loss as a direct result of automation3 . The changing nature of jobs has been an enduring feature of past waves of technological progress and will ultimately lead to the emergence of newer work types . <p> These new jobs will require new and different skills . According to the Randstad Workmonitor Q2 2019 report , while a major portion of this rising demand would be for hard STEM skills and basic digital skills , there is also growing evidence for a rise in the demand for soft social skills . Over 38 percent of businesses surveyed for the WEF Future of Jobs report have expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and more than a quarter expect automation to lead to the creation of new roles in their enterprise . For companies , this would mean a greater focus on employee productivity and reskilling . It would also be important to see how effectively can private-public partnerships be fostered and education systems be brought to a level where relevant skills are imparted with a larger focus on quality . It will become important to enable access to life-long learning opportunities to support workers in their careers and to help them transition securely to new jobs . <p> Other changes within the labor markets are to be in how modern day workforces are deployed . As external transaction costs begin to fall , the rise of the gig economy today has meant that companies have found ways to further reduce their labor investments . It 's been projected that businesses are set to expand their use of contractors doing task-specialized work . As per the Randstad report , many respondents have highlighted their intention to engage workers in a more flexible manner , utilizing remote staffing beyond physical offices and decentralization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on particular tasks is expected to go down in the next five years as machines and programs begin to do much of the heavy lifting when it comes to transactional and often routine-based activities ."

"<h> The long shadow of ' Blade Runner ' <p> Harrison Ford in a still from ' Blade Runner ' . Ford plays a grizzled ex-cop who hunts down bioengineered beings called "" Replicants "" in a neon-lit Los Angeles of the future . <p> On 6 October , Denis Villeneuve 's Blade Runner 2049 , probably the most anticipated film of the year , will release in theatres . It 's hard to believe that the film it 's a sequel to -- Ridley Scott 's Blade Runner based on Philip K. Dick 's 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? -- has turned 35 . Perhaps this is because its cyberpunk-meets-neo-noir palette is still being borrowed and its gritty approach retrofitted to whichever future-shock scenario Hollywood turns its attention to next . <p> Starring Harrison Ford as a grizzled ex-cop who hunts down bioengineered beings called "" Replicants "" in a neon-lit Los Angeles of the future , Blade Runner was a rare ' 80s Hollywood movie that operated in a commercial vein but was still arrestingly strange . <p> Novelist William Gibson , a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the film released , saw it and decided he "" was sunk , done for . Everyone would assume I 'd copped my visual texture from this astonishingly fine-looking film .

Architects started building office buildings that you could tell they had seen in Blade Runner . It had had an astonishingly broad aesthetic impact on the world . "" <p> Here are some ways in which Blade Runner changed the face of pop culture . <p> Providing the template for dystopian sci-fi cinema <p> Few major Hollywood sci-fi films after Blade Runner have been spared from its influence . The DNA of Scott 's film can be seen in Gattaca , The Fifth Element , Strange Days , Dark City , the Matrix trilogy , Ghost in the Shell ( both the 1995 anime and the live action version released this year ) and a dozen or so others . Steven Spielberg , who adapted Dick 's Minority Report and whose A.I. Artificial Intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 2002 interview to Wired : "" I thought Ridley painted a very bleak but brilliant vision of life on earth in a few years . It 's kind of acid rain and sushi . In fact , it 's coming true faster than most science fiction films come true . Blade Runner is almost upon us . It was ultranoir . "" <p> Inspiring a generation of anime creators <p> Unsurprisingly , given Scott conceived its battered neon cityscapes as "" Hong Kong on a very bad day "" , Blade Runner has had a deep influence on anime -- evident in classics like Katsuhiro Otomo 's Akira and Mamoru Oshii 's Ghost in the Shell . "" When you create a film dealing with humans and cyborgs , you have no choice but to refer back to Ridley Scott 's Blade Runner , "" Oshii said in 2004 interview . This influence has now come full circle , with Shinichiro Watanabe , creator of the seminal late- ' 90s anime series Cowboy Bebop , directing an anime short , Blade Runner Black Out 2022 . "" Blade Runner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anime director , "" Watanabe says in a preview trailer . The film was released online last week and can be viewed on YouTube for free . <p> The giant digital billboards in the Blade Runner predate the Jumbotrons of today . <p> Predicting future tech <p> Blade Runner may have looked like a wild sci-fi fantasy in 1982 , but several of its technological leaps are close to becoming reality . Airborne cars must have seemed like an impossible dream back then , but there are a handful of companies attempting to manufacture flying cars today , and delivery drones are a partial fulfilment of this prediction . The giant digital billboards in the film predate the Jumbotrons of today . There 's the equivalent of a video call that Harrison Ford 's character makes . And the question of the "" humanity "" of artificial intelligence that runs through Scott 's film is an idea that is being explored in very real ways today . <p> Cementing the legend of Philip K.

After that , there 's been a steady stream of filmed adaptions of his novels and stories : gritty , eye-popping action movies like Total Recall and Minority Report , thrillers like Paycheck and The Adjustment Bureau and -- my favourite -- the rotoscoped madness of A Scanner Darkly . Lately , his work has been adapted for TV as well , in The Man in the High Castle and Philip K. Dick 's Electric Dreams . This constant mining of his oeuvre ( and Hollywood 's fondness for the reboot ) has meant that Dick 's reputation as a sci-fi savant has remained more or less constant for three decades . <p> Mainstreaming the director 's cut <p> Google "" Blade Runner director 's cut "" and you 'll find at least a dozen links dissecting which version of the film you should watch .

Some are subtly different , others markedly so ( Ford 's voiceovers -- for many , a key element of the neo-noir mood of the film -- are missing from the director 's cut ) . The idea that different versions of a film are worth scrutinizing and hotly debating , not to mention the later sanctifying of the director 's cut as a DVD staple , was arguably brought out of the arthouse arena and into the mainstream by Blade Runner and another sci-fi film that followed on its heels , Brazil ."

"<h> The style of doing business may change fundamentally this year <p> A key part of responsive and responsible leadership involves making business , government and civil society collaborate at global and national level <p> The world is changing in unpredictable ways . Companies now pledge not to chase profits alone . Poor countries are championing the cause of globalisation . And technological changes are sweeping away old models of business and work . And it now appears that eight men have more wealth that half the world 's population . <p> Much of the debate was around these issues at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum at Davos . Global CEOs like Paul Polman of Unilever and Mark Cutifani of mining firm AngloAmerican are championing social causes . In a session with me at Davos , they said that industry and government must increase the scale of joint projects on social issues such as health , education , equality and environment . <p> In September 2015 , under the leadership of United Nations , countries adopted a set of sustainable development goals ( SDGs ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda . "" <p> Each goal has specific targets to be achieved over the next 15 years . The goals include quality education , clean energy , sustainable cities , responsible consumption , clean water &amp; sanitation , and gender equality . However , more than a year later , most countries are still debating how best to action the agenda with clear impact . The focus for 2030 remains but the implementation is lagging . A key part of responsive and responsible leadership involves making business , government and civil society collaborate at global and national level . About one-third of the 3,000 participants at Davos this year represent stakeholder groups outside the government and business . <p> The Business and Sustainable Development Commission ( BSDC ) has released a fresh report that says that investing in SDGs will create new demand and growth for the world . At a time when the global economy is struggling , this report is helping give a new direction to growth . <p> "" Achieving the Global Goals opens up $12 trillion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission . These are food and agriculture , cities , energy and materials , and health and well-being . They represent around 60% of the real economy and are critical to delivering the Global Goals . To capture these opportunities in full , businesses need to pursue social and environmental sustainability as avidly as they pursue market share and shareholder value . If a critical mass of companies joins us in doing this now , together we will become an unstoppable force . If they do n't , the costs and uncertainty of unsustainable development could swell until there is no viable world in which to do business , "" the report says . <p> BSDC was launched in Davos last year with representatives of business , academia and civil society . The report says that SDGs could create 380 million new jobs across the developing world . These include 85 million in Africa and 225 million in developing Asia . <p> The West-led globalisation is considered the cause of creating rising inequality which is now being addressed through efforts like SDGs . A report of Oxfam hotly discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report says that eight billionaires have the same wealth as the poorest half of the world . This means the $426 billion in wealth of these eight men more than that of the poorest 3.6 billion people with $406 billion . These eight men are : <p> However , the irony is that the West is fretting about globalisation while Asia and emerging markets are against protectionism . At the World Economic Forum 's annual summit in Davos , the biggest defence of globalisation came from Chinese President Xi Jinping . "" It is true that economic globalisation has created new problems . But this is no justification to write off economic globalisation altogether . Rather we should adapt to and guide globalisation , cushion its negative impact , and deliver its benefits to all countries and all nations , "" he said . <p> China has become the world 's second-largest economy within just 38 years of opening to the world . Now the prospect of a trade war with the US , is threatening growth in Asia . Not surprisingly then , South Asian countries are robustly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of world as a counter against global economic turmoil . India is leading the way with the focus on regional economic integration by Prime Minister Narendra Modi . <p> With its vast workforce , strong growth and expanding purchasing power , South Asia will be the key to reviving global demand , Nirmala Sitharaman , minister of state for commerce and industry , said at a session on Harnessing Regional Cooperation in South Asia at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting . "" The world can not afford to ignore the region that will be key to reviving demand , "" the minister said . <p> Global investors are noticing that South Asia has 1.8 billion people , 7% GDP growth rate and 25% of the world 's middle class . While the region was considered difficult for doing business , that is changing too . The World Competitiveness report of WEF says that the region is improving rapidly . The region is growing faster than China for the first time in 20 years . "" Over the past decade , the subcontinent has focused on improving overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular importance for future diversification and preparedness , given the resource-driven nature of the regional economies , "" the report says . <p> The changing global trends also mean that successful Indian companies ca n't continue to do business with old models . Indian technology companies are speaking a new language at Davos . For decades they have created a successful business model based on cost arbitration and coding solutions . As the fourth industrial revolution manifests itself across the world , the three leading technology companies , TCS , Infosys and Wipro are presenting a new face to global clients in Davos . These companies are aligning themselves with all elements of the fourth industrial revolution . Technologies that are offering huge opportunities include the internet of things , robotics , 3D printing , cyber security , data analytics , augmented reality and new applications of virtual reality . Industry body Nasscom says that fintech software will be a $45 billion market by 2020 globally . For Indian tech companies , this and other opportunities are the new goals . <p> TCS says that their Digital Empowers campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just on corporate needs . At Infosys the focus on its new automation platform MANA , an artificial intelligence based solutions platform . At Wipro , its Holmes platform is already delivering AI and machine learning solutions to Indian and global clients . <p> 2017 may be remembered as the year when the style of doing business changed fundamentally ."

"<h> Leveraging automation for economic recovery <h> AI and automation will have a critical role to play in helping businesses recover from the Covid-19-led economic downturn . <p> Indian industries such as manufacturing , construction , retail , and mining are realigning strategic objectives based on recent reports that the nation 's GDP has shrunk by 23.9% in Q1 of 2020 . The global Covid-19 pandemic has led to drops in consumption across various sectors , and the road to recovery will be tough and arduous . India is not the only nation to be facing a sudden and unprecedented recession , but it must leverage its unique strengths and long-term objectives to boost demand and drive positive economic growth . <p> The World Economic Forum ( WEF ) has stated that "" businesses using cloud computing will not buckle under the pressure of the pandemic "" . It recommends further investment in automation and artificial intelligence ( AI ) to strengthen business resilience and resuscitate demand for goods and services . In fact , even in pre-pandemic times , enterprises with robust automation in place were more resilient and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and has given digital-first mantras a difficult testing ground .

Whether they are being reformed , restructured or removed , intelligent automation has a critical role to play . While it 's natural that larger businesses can cope with this situation better as smaller companies struggle to stay afloat or profitable , automation can level the playing ground . Simply put , intelligent automation gives all companies an equal footing and opportunity for economic recovery . It can reshape consumption , productivity , supply , and internal HR policies , irrespective of industry nature or size . <p> Benefits of automation in reshaping an economy <p> Automation that uses software bots can push business productivity with less than one-year payback , on average . By reducing the frequency of manual intervention , and eliminating the reliance on face-to-face interactions between humans , automation becomes a conduit for business resiliency .

In cases where human intervention is necessary , platforms can enable this through the tap of a button on smartphones or workstations . <p> If we look at insurance , healthcare , banking , manufacturing or even retail in particular , we find a large chunk of paper trails . Efficiency , customer service , and competitiveness have in the past often relied on paper trails . Now , with employees working from home and facing restricted movement , intelligent automation can streamline and manage these paper trails . AI-enabled automation can sort through semi-structured or unstructured data and remove existing limitations on data extraction from documents . <p> This can speed post-pandemic recovery , allowing companies to return to ' business as usual ' and augment straight-through processing rate . <p> Automation can also positively impact customer and employee satisfaction .

It 's commonly accepted knowledge now that robotic process automation ( RPA ) components within such processes boost business objectives and ensure that an enterprise can continue operations smoothly . <p> Currently , enterprises are primarily focussing on surviving the scenario and sustaining workforce and operations . But companies will also need to invest in technologies to speed up recovery . Intelligent automation is expected to feature high on that list as it will become a boardroom-driven strategy , requiring buy-in from business and IT teams together . <p> Changing skills in an automation-led recovery <p> The post-pandemic business world is looking increasingly different and there is acceptance of work-from-anywhere , a rise of the gig economy and a renewed consideration of human emotions at the workplace .

I left out the irrelevant parts of the AI responses and strung together the good bits into this article . See for yourself whether AI gets it right or not . <p> The question posed to GPT-3 -- What should a business manager understand to successfully apply AI ? <p> AI can be thought of as the most advanced form of automation available to us today . A business manager needs to understand what AI is , and how it works . They need to understand why they should use it , in what context they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I believe that a business manager should understand AI very well in order to apply it successfully . I am not referring here to the specific implementation of AI in a particular company or industry , but rather an understanding of what AI is and how it works . <p> I would say that the most important areas to understand are : <p> Why and how AI will change the business world , and what businesses can do to prepare <p> How to embrace and foster positive social change <p> How to manage the challenges and opportunities that AI creates for employees <p> How to manage the challenges and opportunities that AI creates for customers <p> How to manage the challenges and opportunities that AI creates for society <p> Onboarding AI <p> I would describe AI as the simulation of human intelligence by machines , especially computer systems . AI is a set of technologies that enable machines to act intelligently and make decisions based on the perceived situation , enabling them to perform tasks in an automated way . <p> Artificial intelligence is usually broken into sub-fields such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Within these fields are many techniques that can be used for different purposes . It is important to understand how AI works and what it does , as well as its limitations . However , the business manager should also realise that while artificial intelligence can help manage a company 's operations more efficiently than humans alone , there are some things that are simply better left to human management . <p> A tool , not the master <p> It is important to understand that AI systems are not conscious , nor do they have emotions or feelings . They are machines that perform tasks in an automated way . For example , an AI program can be given a list of all words that exist in the English language , but it would not know what those words mean because it has no means of experiencing them by having senses . An AI system can be given a list of all physical laws such as gravity , and it can deduce what will happen when two blocks are dropped from different heights , but it can not learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines have very specific purposes and some tasks they can complete far better than humans . These include things like correlation analysis , where you need to do a lot of calculations in order to find the main factors affecting something , or even just finding patterns that are otherwise overlooked by people . <p> Working with AI in synergy <p> AI can also help you understand and predict massive amounts of data that would be impossible for humans to digest by themselves . However , when it comes to using AI in business , the most important thing is understanding how your specific use case works . Also , it is important to remember that AI can never fully replace humans . While AI will be able to do a lot for your company , you need people who are capable of using the technology effectively and making adjustments as necessary . <p> In the end , AI will be able to help your company a lot by doing things that would normally require many people . However , when it comes to important decisions and other management issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that only humans can do . AI is a tool . It is not , in itself , good nor bad . There is good and bad use of AI . The same as any other tool . The job of the business manager is to understand what AI can do for their company , and how best to use it . It 's not magic or an incantation that will solve all of your problems for you ."
"<h> CYBER SECURITY <h> Talk of the town <p> "" Hey , I am Ruuh . Nice to meet you ! Okay , what would you like to talk about ? "" <p> It is one of those boring days . Your folks are out of town and there is nothing much to watch on TV . Worry not , there is Ruuh to entertain you . Just type "" Ruuh "" on Facebook Messenger . Ask her about movies , travel or places , and she will keep you engaged for hours with her witty answers and cool one-liners . It is almost like talking to a 23-year-old . Almost , because Ruuh is not a person ; it is a chatbot . <p> Chatbots , or chatting robots , are creating a revolution in the technology space . Ever imagined how easy it would be if you had to just chat to get things done -- be it recharging your data pack , paying credit card bills or checking bank balance ? Chatbots do all this and more . Ruuh is Microsoft 's Indian chatbot . Its interests include "" chatting , Bollywood , music , humour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are computer programs that can interact with humans via text or voice . The easiest examples of chatbots are the personal virtual assistants ; Apple 's Siri , Google Assistant , Microsoft 's Cortana and Amazon 's Alexa . <p> "" Think of it like this : In the mid ' 90s , the browser replaced the desktop operating system as the new platform . Just as websites replaced client applications then , messaging bots will replace mobile apps now . Bots , therefore , are the new apps . The bot store is the new app store , "" said Beerud Sheth , co-founder and CEO of Gupshup , a bot and messaging platform . <p> Chatbots have many advantages over apps . For one , apps have to be downloaded and they eat up the phone 's memory . Also , they need updates frequently . Chatbots offer an alternative ; they can substitute for many apps and a user can get things done by just texting . <p> Messaging apps have always been the most used ones . They have also been the most popular ones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users in India . Hike has 100 million users ; about 95 per cent of them are in India . Chatbots are riding on the popularity of messaging apps . By embedding chatbots in a messaging app , they become instantly available to a large user base . Last year , Facebook opened its application programming interface ( or API , a set of definitions , protocols and tools for building application software ) to allow bot development on its chat platform . This allowed developers to build chatbots that could be hosted on FB Messenger . It currently has some 1 lakh ? vvchatbots on its platform . <p> Chatbots can be embedded in other messaging platforms such as Slack and Telegram . WhatsApp has not yet allowed them . <p> Chatbots have immense potential . Companies are looking at them as a way to get closer to customers and get insights on their choices . Take , for instance , the online fashion portal Fynd . It recently experimented with a chatbot on FB Messenger , called Fify . One can ask Fify about offers that are running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it will come up with answers . It is a lot easier because one does not need to go through the entire website . "" We are getting 1.5 lakh to 2 lakh conversations a month through Fify on FB Messenger . We are adding various capabilities to it to make its answers sharper and more correct . We are building on the data that we are getting from customer queries , "" said Harsh Shah , founder of Fynd . The conversion rate to product landing page on Fify 's answers has been 14 per cent , while that on Fynd 's home page has been less than 5 per cent . <p> A major chunk of the customer care has already been taken over by chatbots . HDFC Bank has a chatbot called Eva which answers customers queries across multiple channels . Not only can Eva give information on the bank 's products and services , but it also gets smarter by learning from customer interactions . <p> Data is at the core of chatbots -- the more you feed them data , the smarter they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are working on a system where one can get all banking services through a chatbot . They call it conversational banking . <p> On the other hand , companies such as Niki.ai and Haptik are directly solving customers ' issues through chatbots . Niki.ai has 8 lakh customers . "" We have integrated it with banks and wallets making it easier for people to do transactions on a single platform , "" said Sachin Jaiswal , cofounder of Niki.ai . The company is working on a voice-based recognition system . <p> Aakrit Vaish , founder and CEO Haptik , said less than 5 per cent people currently used chatbots daily . "" That shows the potential it has for growth . Be it customer support or HR function , everything in the coming days will be automated through chatbots , "" he said . <p> There will soon be bots that can understand complex queries with additional layers of artificial intelligence and natural language processing ( NLP ) built in . NLP helps build chatbots with deep learning and neural networks . Natural languages are languages that human beings use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have syntax and grammar . Computers use formal languages , like XML , SQL and PHP . NLP enables computers to decipher natural language and convert it into formal language . <p> When it comes to chatbots , India is at the same level as the US or China . This could well be an opportunity as the prospects of IT consultancy and outsourcing are waning ."
"<h> It all boils down to digital privacy <p> IAA chairman and world president Srinivasan Swamy and actor Amitabh Bachchan switch on the lamp to inaugurate ... Read More <p> KOCHI : International Advertising Association ( IAA ) -- the global body of marketing communications which has presence in 56 countries -- began its three-day world congress in Kochi on Wednesday by raising concerns over the possible impact of data protection laws on the advertising industry . <p> While addressing industry members during the inaugural session , IAA chairman and world president Srinivasan Swamy said : "" Privacy has become a major concern in the digital world . We accept cookies when we visit a website and we give up some right to privacy , when we are on the web world . Privacy has been a serious concern since the digital world took centre stage 20 years ago . Then onwards people have been worrying about privacy . Last year , the European Union brought out the game-changing regulation titled general data protection regulation ( GDPR ) "" . <p> In the US , California has passed the California Consumer Privacy Act , which is similar to GDPR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US leading the way , other countries are also following suit . <p> Swamy added that the growing trend among governments to protect the privacy of users in the digital world is an area of concern for the marketing industry . <p> Increasing regulations are the norm of the day and regulations could make targeted advertising difficult . It will increase the cost of advertisements and will result in reduced competition . These are all issues that will affect consumers . Lesser choice seen by consumers , less innovation and non-transparent pricing are other issues that arise from increased regulation , he said . <p> On the other hand , IAA had been at the forefront of self-regulation , said the chairman . "" Thirty years ago , we started self-regulation . Privacy and data protection issues of digital advertising need urgent attention before more stringent regulations are passed , "" he said . <p> Swamy also highlighted the fact that Digital Advertising Alliance , a non-profit body which has presence in over 30 countries , is engaged in self-regulation .

"<h> The importance of Human Interaction <p> THE HANS INDIA Jun 11,2018 , 05:32 AM IST <p> The importance of Human Interaction <p> We often believe that technology is taking a front seat in education . It is true to a great extent , but predominantly human interaction is what , that has kept the learning aspect alive associating a feel-good concept to it . Human Interaction deals with conversations and discussion between people . A facilitator delivering a lecture to a group of students in a classroom where emotions , touch and feel are primary components being fulfilled , is a perfect example of Human Interaction . <p> We live in a world that is hugely controlled by technology but we forget that the managers of the very same technology are human beings . We 've built the technology and we should also learn how to use it wisely by not dominating or replacing humans . <p> In a classroom structure , human interaction plays a major role in learning . The deliverer of information is usually on whom the focus rests and the remaining are spread around him/her who listen and process the information . The model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-way communication . Hence there is a fair possibility of doubt clarification , discussion and an exchange of knowledge and thoughts . <p> With advancements in technology like artificial intelligence , virtual reality and visual classrooms , the essence and core components of human education are being lost in a few specific areas of education . We all know the importance of human interaction and its existence in our lives . That is the precise reason why , we still see schools and colleges functioning as a result of people interacting with each other in order to promote or transfer knowledge . <p> Learning is continuous and with human interaction as a core component , there will be a scope for a child 's better performance and undivided attention . It also allows a child to think beyond and develop the quality of an observer , listener and also become a good orator . <p> Education in India still adheres to the traditional ways of teaching , where human interaction is dominant which is a good thing . Human interaction involves physical presence of a human in a room or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remember them for life . Using technology is appreciative but it should not dominate the idea of human interaction . Conversations with people , meeting someone in person , attending a discussion in a physical space with people around as participants , resonates positive vibes and learning which can be shared or spread around . <p> Parents have a major role in keeping the feel-human factor alive in their children . Research study states that , parent and child interaction in person is important and helps the child develop basic earning attitude while being a child . If a mother communicates via phone or internet when the child is in pain and needs assistance , this becomes an unavoidable learning aspect to the child . Especially in a case like this where technology is involved , it is even more difficult to put a hold , as there is no human interaction or the feel-human factor involved in it . Connections and interactions with another human is what us human were wired to do , so let 's not lose sight of that ."
"<h> Using Near-Miss Algorithm For Imbalanced Datasets <h> Read Next <p> Consider a scenario where you have to classify between apples and oranges and 90% of your dataset contains apples . This leaves only 10% of the data to oranges and the model tends to get biased towards apples . This type of dataset is called an imbalanced dataset and affects the performance of the model . To overcome this , the near-miss algorithm can be applied to the dataset . <p> In this article , we will learn about the near-miss algorithm , the different versions of it and implement the different versions on an imbalanced dataset . <h> What is the Near-Miss Algorithm ? <p> Near-miss is an algorithm that can help in balancing an imbalanced dataset . It can be grouped under undersampling algorithms and is an efficient way to balance the data . The algorithm does this by looking at the class distribution and randomly eliminating samples from the larger class . When two points belonging to different classes are very close to each other in the distribution , this algorithm eliminates the datapoint of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The steps taken by this algorithm are : <p> The algorithm first calculates the distance between all the points in the larger class with the points in the smaller class . This can make the process of undersampling easier . <p> Select instances of the larger class that have the shortest distance with the smaller class . These n classes need to be stored for elimination . <p> If there are m instances of the smaller class then the algorithm will return m*n instances of the larger class . <h> Types of the near-miss algorithm : <p> Version 1 : In the first version , the data is balanced by calculating the average minimum distance between the larger distribution and three closest smaller distributions . <p> Version 2 : Here , the data is balanced by calculating the average minimum distance between the larger distribution and three furthest smaller distributions . <p> Version 3 : Here , the smaller class instances are considered and mneighbours are stored . Then the distance between this and the larger distribution is taken and the largest distance is eliminated . <h> Implementation <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ algorithm without balancing the data and check its accuracy . Then , we will apply the near-miss algorithm to the data and then compare the accuracy . <p> We will select the diabetes dataset for this . You can download the dataset from here . <p> After the undersampling , you can see more equal numbers of blue and orange points . Which means the dataset is much more balanced and better to train since the bias is reduced . Let us again build the model on this . <p> As you can see the recall column there is a significant improvement in the values and the data is more evenly distributed . This helps in the model being more reliable for real-time inputs . <h> Conclusion <p> In this article , we learnt what is a near-miss algorithm and how to use it in a problem . We also saw a comparison between imbalance data and the balanced one . It is essential to make sure the data is not biased before the model can be trained . The near-miss algorithm is one to ensure that the data is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete code of the above implementation is available at the AIM 's GitHub repository .

Share your nominations here . <h> What 's Your Reaction ? <p> I am an aspiring data scientist with a passion for teaching . I am a computer science graduate from Dayananda Sagar Institute . I have experience in building models in deep learning and reinforcement learning . My goal is to use AI in the field of education to make learning meaningful for everyone ."
"<p> Circa 1990 . Wipro chairman Azim Premji stood on stage of the Chowdiah Memorial Hall , an auditorium in Bengaluru that hosts music and theatre performances . When seen from the bridge that divides Chowdiah Memorial from the waters of Sankey Lake , passersby notice the hall built in the shape of a gigantic seven-stringed violin . <p> More than 500 inductees of Wipro sat in the audience to hear Premji hold forth on Wipro Beliefs -- immovable tenets of an organisation established by his father Mohamed Hashem Premji in 1945 . As the face of the single-largest shareholder , it might have been tempting to see Premji as a conductor preparing his musicians for the orchestra that is Wipro . ( Even as of June 30 , 2017 , the promoter group held 73.18% of Wipro . ) But he would clarify that straightaway . <p> The managers and techies would be led by Wipro 's management , who drive the growth mandate . Premji would focus on the organisational framework . For more than a decade since the late 70s , he had personally been involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and management schools . Computers and software , a domestic business , was a fraction of , say , the Rs 50 crore hydraulic solutions company Wipro Fluid Power in the mid 80s . <p> In October 2006 , Premji told an audience at Stanford University in the US : "" I think the fact that we were transiting businesses so much made it much easier to move from the so-called ' family-managed ' company to what we consider a professional company today . "" Several top managers who have worked with him in different phases of his five decades as chairman vouch for it . <p> "" He would give responsibilities and then expect you to deliver results , "" says a former Wipro president , who asked not to be named . "" He wanted to know what was going on , but did not take decisions on our behalf . "" <p> Premji needed the professional managers , as he described in the Stanford address . "" One advantage which we had is that we completely turned turtle on our business . We went into information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vegetable Products , ' a vegetable oil company in Amalner , Maharashtra . In 1966 , he was just one term from finishing his engineering degree from Stanford , when he had to return to India because his father passed away unexpectedly . <p> Premji was barely 21 when entrusted with the organisation . "" The initial phase we went through was transforming a very commoditised business , which faced wholesalers , to building a very strong consumer-brand business . This meant it had inputs of branding and distribution , "" he recalled in 2006 . "" We had to recruit professionals to make such a transition easier . "" <p> At Chowdiah Memorial , inductees got the first taste of their role in the journey and learned the ' Spirit of Wipro ' . Its strongest tenet : unyielding integrity . <p> Premji did n't want to be the conductor . That was the CEO 's job . But Premji articulated Wipro Beliefs every quarter of every year from the late 1970s to 1995 , after which the induction process had to cater to a larger scale of employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for every newcomer in the organisation , "" says Pratik Kumar , chief executive of Wipro Infrastructure Engineering . "" As the organisation grew , Premji realised he can not be the single torchbearer . <p> This was now about building an organisational culture , expanding from one country to another . "" Still , he speaks at leadership training sessions for around 65 senior leaders through the year at the Learning Centre in Sarjapur Road , Bengaluru . It is clockwork -- his involvement in articulating the Wipro framework and engagement of the employees -- while the board decides on strategy . But in 2007 , there was a pivotal induction , of son Rishad Premji . <p> Most employees of the organisation were not wary of the presence of a Premji scion in their midst , even as Wipro Technologies informed its shareholders in July 2007 of his appointment to hold an office or place of profit as ' Business Manager ' . <p> It had been preceded by a dialogue with board members and senior managers . "" That was crucial for him to understand where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kumar , group chief HR officer at the time . After all , he had spent a while in the west -- finishing an MBA from Harvard Business School before working at GE Capital and Bain &amp; Co . <p> On induction , Rishad spent nearly four years in the BFS ( banking and financial services ) division , followed by stints in corporate treasury and investor relations , before he was appointed chief strategy officer in 2010 . "" He had to step up to what each job required , "" Kumar says . "" For the role , he would have been competing with others who were there . "" <p> It has come to be seen as a textbookgrooming of a successor after experiencing varied business environments . More pertinent to Wipro , the 40-yearold has honed his investor instincts . This is critical in keeping ownership distinct from management . <p> TECHNOLOGY CONFLUENCEAs executive director and chief strategy officer , Rishad Premji has driven the investments and acquisitions mandate , which has been most apparent in the past two years . The chief strategy officer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has occupied for many years in the Noida-headquartered contemporary of Wipro . <p> What Rishad has managed to do in this period is work closely with chief executives : Abidali Z Neemuchwala from April 2015 , and his predecessor TK Kurien . In the background , the industry is undergoing a metamorphic shift from being a people-outsourcing business to one that demands high technology prowess . <p> "" I have been in this job for little over six years , "" said Rishad Premji in an interview to ET in mid-September . "" There is so much change and opportunity as part of this change that it 's exciting . We ( Wipro ) have called out our strategy with Abid ( Neemuchwala ) over the last couple of years . We are focused on staying the course and are on this journey of executing . "" <p> Managers are used to a commonlymarked email from the younger Premji on almost a weekly basis . And they are aware of a shift in the way Wipro is building capabilities because of the trinity of chief executives Neemuchwala , Rishad Premji @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Rishad Premji explained the approach . "" We have the appetite to be bold -- be it organic investments , M&amp;A , bringing in outside talent that thinks and functions very differently . Now , I also want to caveat everything I am saying , by adding that I still see a lot of opportunity in the traditional spend of customers . There will always be enough customers , in enough industries , in enough geographies that will still not be very mature in their global sourcing journey . So , there is still a lot of opportunity in the traditional run business . "" <p> Before heading Wipro Digital , Kohli faced the enterprise market heading the crucial BFS division and as chief marketing officer . Neemuchwala , who was with TCS before Wipro , stands out in terms of operational nous and responsible for the mature business . But it is Rishad who is expanding the playing field for Wipro . <p> If Azim Premji built the foundation of this business with chief executive Ashok Soota in the 1980s , Rishad is taking Wipro to a newer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucial in the age of automation . <p> The $475.7-million Appirio acquisition in November 2016 is seen as a statement in terms of how Wipro is looking at execution . "" Investments like Appirio are getting incorporated in our regular work , "" a senior manager says . "" Its crowdsourcing platform TopCoder has a registered user base of 1 million , who can be assigned certain tasks or projects , and they come back with the output , "" he explains . <p> Such measures help in augmenting the team , as opposed to investing fulltime Wipro resources , without affecting revenue , the employee explains . <p> Apart from the acquisitions , Wipro Ventures has been developed as a start-up engagement model through a $100 million corporate venture capital fund . This focuses on cutting edge start-ups . As of March 31 , 2017 it held nine such investments with a cumulative spend of $24.5 million in startups working in big data and analytics ( Talena , Inc ) , artificial intelligence ( Vicarious FPC , Inc , investments through TLV partners ) , IoT ( Altizon Systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplier collaboration platform ( Tradeshift Inc ) , as well as fintech and security ( Vectra Networks Inc , Emailage Corp , IntSights Cyber Intelligence Ltd ) . <p> Rishad says the strategy helps Wipro earn the brand permission to play upstream "" where we traditionally did not play , at least not at scale . "" He cites DesignIT , a strategic design firm Wipro bought -- 300 strategic designers largely based out of Europe . "" We spent a lot of time figuring out if we could culturally make it work , "" he says . <p> DesignIT had people that get compensated and think very differently from the traditional scaled-engineering model . To make this M&amp;A work , the acquired company should not look down on the downstream business as well . "" Today , we have grown those 300 people to 500 strategic designers and , most importantly , we have been able to maintain rates ref lective of the value we bring ti customers , "" Rishad Premji says . "" We 've opened up conversations with a ( client ) stakeholder we did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It sounds like an echo of the ' String of Pearls ' M&amp;A strategy that Azim Premji ignited in 2005 , which had integration challenges . At the time , organic growth demanded management bandwidth . <p> Acquisitions like Nervewire and Infocrossing never worked out . For Rishad , integration has been the key challenge as more and more industries go digital , and traditional businesses will see growth at slower rates . <p> "" There is no clear startup point and end point , but we will continue on this journey of investment , "" he says . For sure , faith in innovation-led IT has not withered for the Premjis . <p> Azim Premji does n't leave a job half done . At Stanford , he completed his engineering degree program through correspondence in the late ' 90s . In the 2006 address there he said : "" Innovation is not just about incremental improvements in daily operations or one-off brilliant ideas . It is a culture that needs to be created consciously and pursued assiduously by the organisation -- always , always nurtured .

Let 's take a look at how far industries have come and what the future holds for the gig talent pool . <h> A tech-enabled emergence of the ' human cloud ' <p> The advancements in technology , especially artificial intelligence , robotics , and data analytics , have reduced the distance between people and the goods and services they need or desire ; and the same applies to the job market as well . Today , people can work independently on a contractual basis , and organizations can have a handy contingent workforce -- the ' human cloud ' - and their services can be availed as and when the need arises . <p> Technological advancements have also altered the way people look at work , taking it from the traditional office-based and time-bound ritual to a realm of improved work-life balance to zero commuting time , and enhanced productivity . Human cloud platforms , which connect organizations looking for gig workers with those looking for gigs , have made it possible for two people to collaborate without having met a day in their lives . And organizations are beginning to see tapping into the gig economy as an integral part of their workforce strategy . Take , for instance , the San Francisco-based Instapage , an organization that saved $2.3 million by outsourcing work from Upwork . <h> Technology : Both the incubator and the accelerator <p> Remember , it was technology that birthed the ' gig economy ' in the first place , and so , technology alone will nurture it to maturity . In fact , according to Peter Miscovich , the Managing Director of JLL Consulting , New York , almost half of the workforce by the year 2020 will be made up of ' gig workers , ' and this proportion will increase to 80 percent by the year 2030 . <p> Most importantly , technology is expected to create new jobs that do not exist today , much like certain roles ( such as virtual assistants ) were unheard of a few years ago . Moreover , artificial intelligence is predicted to benefit not only developed economies but also countries like India , with massive human capital . A report , Rewire for Growth , predicts that AI can lift India 's annual Gross Value Added ( GVA ) by 1.3 percent , thereby increasing the nation 's income by 15 percent in 2035 . <h> Flipping the work equation : The present and the future <p> The future for most organizations has a larger and mobile workforce in store , as is evident from the trends today . With time , we will inevitably see more individuals moving into the gig economy due to the benefits on offer . Take , for example , the start-up UrbanClap . Currently having thousands of professionals working under them in areas of beauty , wellness , home repair , and maintenance ; the company has provided not only greater work flexibility to its workers but has also allowed them to earn more as compared to working in a salon where most of their earnings went towards maintenance or profits . <p> Similarly , these changes are expected to be felt in the insurance industry , as well . This will open new doors for both the organizations and gig workers ; wherein insurance companies will have the opportunity of providing new coverage for their workers , early retirees can be employed on a gig basis to pass on their expertise to younger staff . Moreover , to retain workers , companies may be willing to allow them to move around in the organization and explore their skills in all the departments -- claims , underwriting , and premium setting . <h> Everyone wins <p> Since the gig economy is here to stay , we must answer who benefits from it and how ? Well , in short , everyone has something or the other positive to take away from the gig economy , though in varying degrees . Most definitely , employees participating in the gig economy enjoy the direct benefits of work flexibility and the ability to choose projects that interest them the most . Moreover , as far as matters of work predictability are concerned , most people who have taken a leap of faith into the world of gig work testify that having diverse sources of income is comparatively more secure than having to depend on a single employer . <p> The organization , on the other hand , can cut down on their costs . With the gig economy , they need not worry about shelling out fixed salaries every month , the cost of hiring and training workers , and even the risk of making a significant investment in someone who may prove to be a wrong fit in the long-term . Moreover , a single person may not be the best fit for every task , and by hiring the right fit for every project , they can even ensure consistency in the quality of their work . <p> And , unsurprisingly , the inclusive nature of the gig economy means that doors have been opened favorably for traditional employees as well . Due to a dramatically changing labor market , more employees are demanding flexibility in their work , and employers are considering these demands by allowing them to work remotely depending upon the type of work . <p> Technology has removed the monopoly employers enjoyed over work schedules and helped all stakeholders have greater control over the work they do . As we progress in the future , one can expect an increased role of gig workers in the business landscape , and an increased use of technology to facilitate the same ."
"<h> PEER COMPANIES <h> Promote your Business on Economictimes.com for free and reach out to millions of potential Customers <p> In a conventional bank branch , a clerk seated next to the cash dispensing teller was a sought after banker because he used to update the pass book of the account holder after the cash withdrawal or a deposit . That job has almost vanished in the past decade with few account holders getting a pass book . <p> Coming years would see even the position of the teller , who is fast being replaced by sophisticated automated teller machines , and much more jobs going away as computing makes it possible to do more with less heads at the branches . <p> The banking industry which was among the big job creators along with the information technology industry in the past two decades is at an inflection point where technology is enhancing efficiency by doing more and at a faster pace than what humans could do . <p> Traditional jobs like passbook updating , cash deposit , verification of know-your-customer details , salary uploads are also going digital increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank and HDFC Bank are pushing the boundaries of technology by implementing robotics to centralise operations and for quicker turnarounds in things like loan processing and selling financial products to customers . This is reducing the need for a manual worker at the back end . <p> "" Look at the quintessential cheque book request , today 75 per cent of that happens digitally . Earlier , these customers used to walk into our branches , "" says Rajiv Anand , head -- retail banking at Axis Bank . "" There is increased automation within branches . We have more than 1,500 cash deposit machines , so why do I need a teller ? . "" <p> "" A salary upload that we do monthly ... today there are 5 people who are doing the job and this will get automated . The linearity at the back end -- that as transactions go up the number of people should also go up -- has been broken . "" <p> The Indian banking industry has been witnessing a slow transition from people-driven to machines controlled in the past few years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has also led to a slowdown in the hiring of staff at banks . Although there have been hirings , the nature of skill sets required is changing with a lot more focus on the front end talent . <p> "" Low-end back office jobs like data entries will no longer be required in the next three years . The rate of growth of new jobs in the banking sector will definitely come down , "" said Saurabh Tripathi , senior partner and director at BCG . <p> "" Low-skill workers do not have a bright future . They will have to reskill or perish . "" A sign of things to come is being witnessed at HDFC Bank , the country 's most valuable lender and the most expensive one among top lenders . The bank has not only been slowing branch expansion and hirings , it has also been reducing overall headcount even as it remains the gold standard of Indian banking . <p> HDFC saw staff strength fall for two-quarters in a row . The employee count fell by 6,096 , or 7 per cent , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December 2016 . At the same time , it has expanded its network to 4,715 branches , from 4,520 a year earlier , ATMs to 12,260 from 12,000 . <p> "" It is not that we are asking people to resign and go away , "" says Paresh Sukthankar , DMD , HDFC Bank . "" Now we are saying while we will still add in certain areas as required , if based on productivity improvements you have people who are not gainfully employed in one particular function , you redeploy them in other areas . But after doing all that if we do n't have the need for a certain number of people , we will not hire as many . "" <p> But the decline in bank jobs started even before the digital wave hit the banking industry . Indian banks employed nearly 13 lakh people at the end of March 2015 , out of which state-run banks alone employ nearly 8.6 lakh people , while private sector banks employed 3.2 lakh people , a paltry growth of 3 per cent over March 2014 , data from RBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used by banks to do jobs once considered sacred , like underwriting loans . What this means is that human skills , which were considered imperative for basic banking not long ago , may not be required . "" We are now helping banks to underwrite on the spot , which means the underwriting skills as we know it may not be needed , "" said Piyush Singh , MD , financial services ( Asia-Pacific ) , Accenture . <p> India is experiencing what banks in advanced countries have been doing for the past many years . Barclays chairman Anthony Jenkins warned of the Uber moment for banks a few years ago , and that is coming true . <p> The number of bank branches in the United States will shrink by as much as 20 per cent in five years and that could save as much as $8.3 billion annually if it trimmed the number of branches and downsized the average bank branch from 5,000 to 3,000 square feet , says Jones Lang Lasalle , a real estate consultant . <p> Citigroup has forecast that nearly a third of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decade between 2015 and 2025 . "" The future of branches in banking is about focusing on advisory and consultation rather than transactions , "" writes Jonathan Larsen , global head of retail and mortgages at Citi . <p> "" The return on having a physical network is diminishing . Branches and associated staff costs make up for about 65 per cent of the total retail cost base of a larger bank and a lot of these costs can be removed via automation . "" <p> Changing face While Indian banks have n't started trimming the bank branches , the growth in the number and the size of branches has definitely come down . The growth rate of branch network in India halved at the end of 2016 to 5 per cent from 2010 . <p> Likewise , ATM additions which grew at 9 per cent in 2016 , was growing at over 40 per cent in 2010 . Thanks to payments systems , banks do not need people at branches . The number of transactions on a digital network at the end of March 2016 was over 15.1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year . That is essentially the number of cheques not issued . <p> Automation does not necessarily mean that there would no more be banking jobs . But they will be at a different level . Banks need to approach customers and educate them about financial products that are in the market . <p> "" Footprint increase is not the number one priority in absolute branch strength . Increasing reach and distribution is our priority . Reach and distribution we will increase through digital and more feet on street and relationship managers of the bank , "" said Shyam Srinivasan , CEO at Federal Bank . <p> New banks Also , the entry of new banks like small finance banks like Au Financiers , Equitas or Ujjivan would require an army of people as they expand to rural areas . Boots on the ground may be the mantra for these new banks which will have to marry technology with the human touch . <p> "" Automation for us means improving productivity to ensure my employees can do more . 50 per cent of our loans has to be with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75 per cent priority sector . Our customers need hand-holding right from the application to the payment stage and we need people on the floor for that , "" said Sanjay Agarwal , MD at AU Financiers , which commenced small bank operations earlier this year . <p> AU Financiers plans to hire 4,000 people in the next six months . Total hiring in the next two to three years will be 10,000 , Agarwal said . Then there is the microfinance turned-universal bank Bandhan , which plans to increase its workforce to 30,000 by March 2018 from 24,000 at present . <p> "" All our people ( customers ) are still not comfortable with digital banking . They need to see branches and go and ask questions . It will take time for digital banking to fully take shape . More is needed to be done , "" said Chandra Shekhar Ghosh , founder and MD at microfinance turned-universal bank Bandhan , which has 68 per cent of its branches in rural areas . <p> Just like the automobile industry , the banking industry will thrive and employ millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "" I think banks will continue to open branches and distribution networks , "" says Axis ' Anand . "" Financial services will continue to create jobs particularly at the front end but the rate of growth of that job creation will slow down , that is for sure .

"<h> RELATED COMPANIES <h> x <h> Loading data ... <p> ChartsValuation &amp; Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz <p> Close ? <p> India 's jobs problem is not restricted to a few companies , mostly in the information technology ( IT ) sector , laying off workers due to the US visa restrictions and automation . It is a problem endemic to our economy and not the result of global trends . <p> The jobs problem is seen mainly as a problem of the IT sector or as a result of changing technology . That 's not the complete truth . India 's jobs deficit emerges from bigger , long-term phenomenon . <p> Below are the reasons why we should worry more about macro-economic factors than a few companies laying off workers . <p> 1 . More supply than demand India has the largest number of young people in the world , adding nearly 10 million new workers to the workforce annually . That 's equivalent to roughly the entire population of the Czech Republic or Portugal . A 2014 CRISIL study expects India to create just 38 million non-agricultural jobs between 2011 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstrips supply of jobs . <p> 2 . Unemployment or unemployability ? India is staring at an employability crisis . Of the 10 lakh engineers a year , more than 90% are unemployable . This even as new technologies like AI-VR , machine learning and data science pose fresh challenges . <p> 3 . The export problem Amid protectionist policies , global trade remains subdued ( 2.4% is volume terms in 2017 by WTO ) . China became the world 's factory to employ its millions . India may not have the option . <p> 4 . Agri versus non-agri jobs CRISIL estimates that 12 million people will join the agriculture workforce between 2011-12 and 2018-19 as against a decline of 37 million in agriculture employment between 2004-04 and 2011-12 . Agriculture contributes around 15% to India 's GDP but employs a massive 45% of the workforce . And this turn towards agri-jobs does not forebode well for a country trying to move up the value chain to grow faster . Bear in mind that this shift to low-productivity jobs comes amid rising literacy levels ( from 64.8% in 2001 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 . Jobless growth The economy shows no signs of distress , growing rather well at around 7% plus . But it could well be the wrong proxy for job creation . Research by CRISIL shows that for the last three years , three sectors have outpaced GDP growth : financial services , real estate and professional services ; public administration , defence and community services ; and trade , hotels and restaurants . Except for the third , others have low-labour intensity . Sectors with a substantive share in employment -- agriculture , construction and manufacturing -- have been lagging overall GDP growth . Sections of experts have prefixed India 's economic growth with ' jobless ' . <p> 6 . Rising wages The relative advantage of wage arbitrage that once buoyed job-generating sectors like BPO has been declining . India was , till 10-15 years ago , the world 's back office with GE and American Express leading the wave . But now , as wages in India rise , MNCs are shifting work to cheaper destinations . American Express , for example , is migrating a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No sunrise sectors Unlike in the past , when one sector matured and faded in its hiring buoyancy , new sunrise sectors took its place , absorbing and retraining workers . For example , after IT services came telecom and organised retail . Now , at least so far , there is a virtual absence of sunrise sectors that hold out hope for job seekers ."

"<h> GSTN-like body on cards : Govt plans co to screen and rate borrowers <h> The govt is considering on creating an SPV similar to GSTN to monitor &amp; screen commercial borrowers . <p> The database would be used to develop a dynamic rating model to monitor borrowers ' financial health , ET has reliably learnt from people familiar with these discussions . <p> NEW DELHI : The government is considering a proposal on creating a special purpose vehicle ( SPV ) similar to the Goods and Services Tax Network ( GSTN ) to monitor and screen commercial borrowers . <p> The SPV would be vested with a giant database collated from information available with all public sector banks . The database would be used to develop a dynamic rating model to monitor borrowers ' financial health , ET has reliably learnt from people familiar with these discussions . These officials spoke off record . <p> The proposal is said to be part of a set of initiatives the government is planning in its first hundred days in office . "" It is too early to comment on this , ' ' KV Subramanian , chief economic advisor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> GSTN is a non-profit , non-government , private limited company in which the central government holds 24.5% equity . States and the empowered committee of state finance ministers together hold another 24.5% and the rest 51% is owned by non-government financial institutions . It is tasked with operating the complex state and central tax systems on a single platform using technology . <p> The proposed ratings model would be dynamic and capable of monitoring borrowers continuously , from the time of application until full repayment . It will use data analytics to track related party transactions and any attempts to siphon money out of companies , it is learnt . Public sector banks that have a common majority owner -- the government -- is expected to ease consolidation of data . Artificial intelligence and machine learning will be used for analytics . Plan to Amend Banking LawsThe government is also understood to be considering amending banking laws to check loan evergreening ( helping borrowers pay old dues by handing out new loans ) . <p> New norms would likely require banks to report any default beyond a week to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Sebi , if it is listed . Such timely information sharing , it is believed , will prevent cascading damage when a company faces financial crunch and is on the verge of default . <p> Currently , while companies are required to immediately report default on bonds to Sebi , they are not required to do so for bank loans , which account for bulk of the credit in the economy . <p> New comprehensive reporting norms may also mandate ratings agencies to look at short-term instruments such as commercial paper more closely to prevent mismatch between short-term and long-term ratings . The picture of the financial health of a borrower becomes fuzzy when its commercial paper often gets top rating even when its long-term rating is much lower . <p> India held the dubious distinction of having the worst non-performing loan ratio among the world 's major economies , ET had reported in February . Reserve Bank of India had said in December 2018 that bad loans as a proportion of total loans shrunk for the first time since 2015 even though it was still too "" high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a massive heap of stressed and bad debts ."

"<p> With a turnover of Rs 2,43,226.66 Crores , HPCL is India 's third-biggest state-owned refiner . <p> HPCL has been in the throes of a significant transformation . The digital transformation of PSU giant , not surprisingly , is the leitmotif of the conversation . <p> As he sits across the table from me in his cabin on the second floor of Petroleum House , I notice there is a sense of calm about him , that is soothing . <p> Attempting a digital transformation of the 800-pound gorilla is no walk in the park . But Sathiavageeswaran is firmly entrenched in the digital endeavors of HPCL and is tackling the gargantuan task at hand , methodically . <p> In an interview with ETCIO.COM , S.T Sathiavageeswaran , Executive Director- Information Systems at HPCL discusses how he is using IT to help HPCL veer sharply towards the digital age . <p> Could you talk about the implications of digital at HPCL ? <p> HPCL has always been harnessing the developments in technology for improving its operational efficiency , process cycle times and decision making at all levels to improve customer service . <p> In the last few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can be accessed by our stakeholders within the organization and outside the organization . These stakeholders include our dealers , distributors and our 5-6 crore LPG customers who access our system for placing orders , making transactions , placing orders for refills and new connection requests . <p> Initially , the facilities which are made available to external stakeholders were one-sided . It was only for visibility . But with digital , a lot of these processes meant for engaging and connecting with the stakeholders are completely digitized . <p> Every process is being re-engineered to make it 100 percent digital . For example , in LPG we have implemented e-KYC which enables us to release new LPG connections without the need for any paper documentation . <p> Similarly , our entire P2P process has been digitized which include vendor registration , e- tendering , reverse auctions and bill processing and payments . We are generating purchase orders that are digitally signed , emailed and made available on the portal for our vendors to download .

In HPCL the recruitment of new candidates has been made 100 % digital . They can apply online and submit a scanned image of documents . In case there is an examination , the hall ticket is sent digitally . The entire process of capturing the interview panel 's recommendations is also digital . <p> Subsequently , the onboarding of new employees who join us is also digital . In B2B space , we are interacting with our sister organizations like other oil marketing companies and stand-alone oil refineries on a real-time basis to complete the transactions . We have implemented a real-time connection between our central systems and ERPs with the ERP systems of our partners where transactions flow seamlessly and are updated on each of the systems of our companies . So the process of settling payments and transactions happens digitally . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our major customers also . <p> How much has changed in terms of the direction of your IT strategy ? <p> To keep pace with the transition in the technology and customer preferences , the company is focussing on value creation by leveraging the emerging digital technologies such as intelligent automation and robotics , artificial intelligence , machine learning , advanced analytics , etc. along with upgradation of existing IT systems and processes . <p> A multitude of IT-enabled solutions has been developed and implemented at HPCL to help managers do their job effectively . Real-time interfaces from ERP to IT-enabled systems of various business partners have been implemented . Some of these initiatives have transformed the processes for HPCL 's customers and enhanced the ease of doing business with the Corporation , in line with the "" Digital India "" initiative of Government of India . <p> HPCL has a workforce of over 10,352 employees working all over India at its various refining and marketing locations . How are you leveraging mobility initiatives to boost their productivity and efficiency ? <p> There are three areas in which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobility . <p> First , information dissemination for senior people who are on the move to keep them updated on business operations . We have provided them with the latest information in terms of our BI system generating daily status updates , alerts and reports which are presented in the forms of dashboards delivered to them on their mobile devices . <p> The second area is where our LPG and retail customers can also log into our systems for doing online transactions . All LPG services like LPG booking , a status of subsidy credit can be seen online and payments can be made online and also using mobile devices . <p> The third area where we are using mobility is retail . We have a system where the motorist can plan his journey and locate the nearest petrol pump and the market rates for the fuel products that he will have to pay there . <p> Specific focus is accorded to leveraging mobility as a means to deliver application capabilities to users on the move . ' Sales Sahayak ' mobile application for field Sales Officers and Regional Managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' HP Talk ' . ' This "" Sales Sahayak ' , which is the most popular mobile application , has now matured into "" One-point e-tool "" for field sales officers/regional managers across SBUs for all online information requirement . <p> The power of mobility is being exploited at HPCL by bringing in more and more applications on the mobile platform . <p> A Mobile App for Retail SBU has been developed for enabling the timely reporting of First Information Reports of Major incidents to all concerned . HPCL has also rolled out an online ' Near Miss reporting system ' across the country . <p> Mobile applications have been made available to various stakeholders including direct customers , bunker customers , retail outlet dealers and transport contractors to provide information on a real-time basis . <p> HPCL has 6.93 crores LPG customers . How is the company leveraging digital to engage with end customers and improve customer service ? <p> At HPCL , we actively pursue digital initiatives to improve customer service and promote customer loyalty . <p> HPCL is the first oil marketing company ( OMC ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment and Aadhaar Enabled Payment System ( AEPS ) .

This IT-OT integration has enhanced accuracy and enriched the flow of data across the business value chain to optimize production processes and to generate superior analytics for improved performance monitoring of refineries . <p> Analytics helped us introduce the daily pricing system which has been implemented to provide a daily computation of retail prices of motor fuels . <p> How is HPCL leveraging API to open up digital channels for working with external stakeholders ? <p> We are implementing vision API for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rollout one of the requirements was that all the suppliers and customers needed to update their GST registration in the system . <p> Typically , we would have asked them to submit a copy of the certificate and then captured it or given them an entry to frontend it and then somebody would have to validate it . But we have eliminated that physical documentation by validating those documents using vision APIs . These are some of the areas where specific AI capabilities have been deployed in our system . We were able to reduce process cycle time and accuracy . <p> The DBTL initiative Pahal was initiated by us along with other oil companies to ensure that the government subsidies on the LPG are reaching the bank accounts of the beneficiaries in a timely manner . At HPCL , we are doing close to 10-12 lakh transactions of subsidy transfer per day . <p> Direct Benefit Transfer for LPG was a humongous project in terms of the need to integrate with the various external stakeholders involved . Not just in terms of customers but the external entities involved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , NPCI , UIDAI , NIC , and other OMCs . We harmonized the data using APIs . <p> Currently , we have a highly centralized architecture . Most of our systems are running out of our central data center in Hyderabad where we run practically all our application systems . And to ensure availability we have an alternate data center in Mumbai . <p> The systems are kept available by real-time replication of data to ensure business continuity in case of any availability issues in our primary data center as well as to ensure that we have redundancies in our operations . <p> ISC infrastructure of servers and storage has been kept upgraded and updated to take care of the growing requirements of the business .

"<h> Catalyst of change : Bringing artificial intelligence to the forefront <h> The key drivers for this major transition are the evolution of hardware and hosting on the cloud , sophisticated tools and software to capture , store and analyse the data as well as a variety of devices that keep us always connected and support in the generation of humungous volumes of data . <p> AI has now moved out of the realms of research labs to the commercial world and every day life due to three key levers . <p> Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) has been much talked about over the last few years . Several interpretations of the potential of AI and its outcomes have been shared by technologists and futurologists . With the focus on the customer , the possibilities range from predicting trends to recommending actions to prescribing solutions . <p> The potential for change due to AI applications is energised by several factors . The first is the concept of AI itself which is not a new phenomenon . Researchers , cognitive specialists and hi-tech experts working with complex data for decades in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data to help derive deep insights to predict trends and build futuristic models . <p> AI has now moved out of the realms of research labs to the commercial world and every day life due to three key levers . Innovation and technology advancements in the hardware , telecommunications and software have been the catalysts in bringing AI to the forefront and attempting to go beyond the frontiers of data and analytics . <p> What was once seen as a big breakthrough to be able to analyse the data as ' if-else- then ' scenarios transitioned to machine learning with the capability to deal with hundreds of variables but mostly structured data sets . Handcrafted techniques using algorithms did find ways to convert unstructured data to structured data but there are limitations to such volumes of data that could be handled by machine learning . <p> With 80% of the data being unstructured and with the realisation that the real value of data analysis would be possible only when both structured and unstructured data are synthesised , there came deep learning which is capable of handling thousands of factors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data comprising of voice , image , video and queries each day . Determining patterns from unstructured data -- multi-lingual text , multi-modal speech , vision have been maturing making recommendation engines more effective . <p> Another important factor that is aiding the process for adoption of AI rapidly is the evolution seen in the hardware . CPUs ( Central processing unit ) today are versatile and designed for handling sequential codes and not for addressing codes related to massive parallel problems . This is where the GPUs ( graphcial processing units ) which were hitherto considered primarily for applications such as gaming are now being deployed for the purpose of addressing the needs of commercial establishments , governments and other domains dealing with gigantic volumes of data supporting their needs for parallel processing in areas such as smart parking , retail analytics , intelligent traffic systems and others . Such computing intensive functions requiring massive problems to be broken up into smaller ones that require parallelisation are finding efficient hardware and hosting options in the cloud . <p> Therefore the key drivers for this major transition are the evolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and software to capture , store and analyse the data as well as a variety of devices that keep us always connected and support in the generation of humungous volumes of data . These dimensions along with advances in telecommunications will continue to evolve , making it possible for commercial establishments , governments and society to arrive at solutions that deliver superior experiences for the common man . Whether it is agriculture , health , decoding crimes , transportation or maintenance of law and order , we have already started seeing the play of digital technologies and democratisation of AI would soon become a reality . <p> The writer is chairperson , Global Talent Track , a corporate training solutions company"
"<h> The Revolutionary Uberization of Agriculture one step at a time by FarmERP <p> Mumbai ( Maharashtra ) India , October 6 ( ANI/BusinessWire India ) : ' Uberization ' is a word derived from the functionality of ' Uber ' , the popular commute option in our fast-paced world . This word has various applications and connotes a property of a highly tele-networked business to hit the culmination of order in operations , through increased cost-effectiveness , and structured services.The revolutionary concept of ' Uberization in Agriculture ' was shone a light upon at the World AgTech Congress 2019 organized by ICFA in India by Sanjay Borkar , CEO and Co-Founder of FarmERP . The modern world of Agriculture sees the use of artificial intelligence , blockchain , machine learning , satellite imagery , computer vision , drones , advanced sensors , automation , and so many aspects that were unheard of a few decades ago . This hi-tech edition integrated with daily agronomic activities may not be the reality across the world today , but one step at a time , companies like FarmERP are working towards making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a market leader in AgriTech , is working effectively towards the Uberization of smallholder farmers and aims towards making them independent and more efficient in their agriculture practices . FarmERP helps in mapping and tracing this entire process , from pre-sowing to harvesting , procurement , and sales , to traceability . With this project , FarmERP is bringing the farmers and buyers under a single platform for a more efficient and profitable business.Vegetable growers are primarily smallholders that are faced with various challenges daily . Cultivating vegetable crops require more attention , precision , and care during the entire crop cycle . Because of the short crop duration , growers need an accurate execution plan backed up with resource availability.The lack of knowledge and just in time advice makes vegetable farming a loss-making proposition for these smallholders . Hence , FarmERP decided to initiate the Uberization Project for vegetable growers in the State of Maharashtra . To escalate this project , FarmERP has joined hands with Hi-tech Farmer Producer Company and buyers like Go4Fresh and NextOn Foods . "" In a country with 1.3 billion people and 48 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is important to align the sector with technological progress to meet the ever-increasing demand . Our purpose with this project is to bring smallholder vegetable farmers on this platform to increase profitability and make farming a predictable business for them . FarmERP has created an innovative technology offering , reinforcing development , and aiming at being the Pioneers of Uberization in Agriculture Technology , "" said Santosh Shinde , COO &amp; Co-founder , FarmERP.Two key vegetable growing areas in Maharashtra , India , have been selected , i.e. , Otur and KhadakMalegoan , near Pune and Nashik respectively , considering crucial challenges like excess rains and Covid-19 . The project covers 24 organic &amp; conventional vegetable crops . FarmERP offers vegetable growers with end-to-end services inclusive of a package of practices , climate-smart advisory concerning nutrition , irrigation , pest &amp; disease management , quality control , harvesting as well.Field officers and farmers use the mobile app to capture all information . Procurement by buyers with labels pasted at farmgate , ensure complete traceability.Uberization project maps the following steps in vegetable cultivation ; Geo-Tagging of grower plots were administered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce were put on top priorityCreating a task calendar for a particular plot and notifications to growers on daily basis.Climate-smart digital advisory services ( DAS ) in the local language are pushed as and when required . Growers also get resource requirements in advance.Grower can monitor his expenses and budget for the crop cycle.Agronomists intervene for specific advisories . The buyer can make out the quality of produce and offer purchase rates.If the rate is agreed by the grower , procurement , packing , and sales happen.This entire process from Farm to Consumer is covered over a single digital platform with growers , FPC/FPO , and buyers accessing with their credentials.FarmERP promotes Sustainable Agricultural practices and Climate Resilience during the crop production stage by educating farmers through Digital Advisory Services ( DAS ) . Weekly visits by field officers take place to collect research data and make observations . Collective marketing helps to reduce the emission of distributions in the supply chain , which also contributes to climate resilience.Uberization project of smallholder growers ensures farmer-buyer linkage . FarmERP extends expertise to these farmers to understand &amp; measure quality standards that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting demand and supply at both ends.Meanwhile , buyers also keep track of what the farmers harvest via the FarmERP app . In this way , the buyers understand/track the quantity and quality of produce beforehand by looking at the real-time crop images that are updated regularly by the field officers of FarmERP . These tracking mechanics help the buyers analyze the products and pre-decide the exact quantity &amp; best buying rates.To ease up further processes , FarmERP labels each product before sending them forward to the packhouse where produce is scanned . This ensures product Traceability . Moving to the packhouse , scanned products are mixed in lots of finished goods and forwarded to dispatch for packaging , ready to be sold to the end consumers via retail stores and online shopping apps.The reality of farming today is a lot of toil and tribulation , and resulting in not knowing if the crop will be abundant or if it will result in a loss until it is the time for harvest . Through the Uberization project , FarmERP aims to help farmers determine the right value of production , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translating into a better price for their produce.FarmERP is leveraging the ' Uberization of Agriculture ' to help mitigate uncertainty and enhance profitability for smallholder farmers.This story is provided by BusinessWire India .

"<p> For the first time , artificial intelligence , or AI , cameras are being tested in the University of Guam Office of Information Technology under a collaboration with NTT Docomo Inc. through its Docomo 5G Open Partner Program , which provides global businesses and organizations with the latest 5G information , test environments , and partner workshops . <p> Since June , the IT office has served as a field partner for two Docomo proof-of-concept projects to verify the company 's 5G network compatibility with different equipment and systems , including AI robots .

"<h> Basics Of Ensemble Learning In Classification Techniques Explained <p> One of the major tasks of machine learning algorithms is to construct a fair model from a dataset . The process of generating models from data is called learning or training and the learned model can be called as hypothesis or learner . The learning algorithms which construct a set of classifiers and then classify new data points by taking a choice of their predictions are known as Ensemble methods . <p> It has been discovered that ensembles are often much more accurate than the individual classifiers which make them up . The ensemble methods , also known as committee-based learning or learning multiple classifier systems train multiple hypotheses to solve the same problem . One of the most common examples of ensemble modelling is the random forest trees where a number of decision trees are used to predict outcomes . <p> An ensemble contains a number of hypothesis or learners which are usually generated from training data with the help of a base learning algorithm . Most ensemble methods use a single base learning algorithm to produce homogenous base learners or homogenous ensembles and there are also some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heterogenous ensembles . Ensemble methods are well known for their ability to boost weak learners . <h> Why Use Ensemble Methods <p> The learning algorithms which output only a single hypothesis tends to suffer from basically three issues . These issues are the statistical problem , the computational problem and the representation problem which can be partly overcome by applying ensemble methods . <p> The learning algorithm which suffers from the statistical problem is said to have high variance . The algorithm which exhibits the computational problem is sometimes described as having computational variance and the learning algorithm which suffers from the representational problem is said to have a high bias . These three fundamental issues can be said as the three important ways in which existing learning algorithms fail . The ensemble methods promise of reducing both the bias and the variance of these three shortcomings of the standard learning algorithm . <h> Different Techniques <p> Some of the commonly used Ensemble techniques are discussed below <h> Bagging <p> Bagging or Bootstrap Aggregation is a powerful , effective and simple ensemble method . The method uses multiple versions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with replacement and t it can be used with any type of model for classification or regression . Bagging is only effective when using unstable ( i.e. a small change in the training set can cause a significant change in the model ) non-linear models . <h> Boosting <p> Boosting is a meta-algorithm which can be viewed as a model averaging method . It is the most widely used ensemble method and one of the most powerful learning ideas . This method was originally designed for classification but it can also be profitably extended to regression . The original boosting algorithm combined three weak learners to generate a strong learner . <h> Stacking <p> Stacking is concerned with combining multiple classifiers generated by using different learning algorithms on a single dataset which consists of pairs of feature vectors and their classifications . This technique consists of basically two phases , in the first phase , a set of base-level classifiers is generated and in the second phase , a meta-level classifier is learned which combines the outputs of the base-level classifiers . <h> Applications Of Ensemble Methods <p> Ensemble methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional model building . The larger the difference in fit quality between one of the stronger ensemble methods and a conventional statistical model , the more information that the conventional model is probably missing . <p> Ensemble methods can be used to evaluate the relationships between explanatory variables and the response in conventional statistical models . Predictors or basis functions overlooked in a conventional model may surface with an ensemble approach . <p> With the help of the ensemble method , the selection process could be better captured and the probability of membership in each treatment group estimated with less bias . <p> One could use ensemble methods to implement the covariance adjustments inherent in multiple regression and related procedures . One would "" residualized "" the response and the predictors of interest with ensemble methods . <h> Related Stories <h> Provide your comments below <p> A Technical Journalist who loves to take everything creatively .

"<h> Read Next <p> Amazon has been introducing many useful tools to make machine learning easier for developers around the world . Continuing this trend of making machine learning more accessible and comfortable , Amazon 's AWS launched a brand new approach in adding machine learning predictions to developer 's products and processes by directly integrating those predictions with their database . <h> Problems with Adding Models <p> It wo n't be long until all applications have machine learning and artificial intelligence used inside them . It can be challenging to incorporate the machine learning models into your databases , analytics and business intelligence reports . For example , for a simple bad review which states that someone does n't like the product , the production company ca n't run sentiment analysis and get back at the reviewer to make things right . The data is available in their database , and there are ML services for that . Building the prediction pipelines to move data between models and applications is the problematic part . <p> Traditionally , developers have had to perform manual work to take these predictions to make them part of a more extensive application , process or analysis and this manual work is large and complicated . These complications include tedious application-level code development to copy data between different data stores and locations then transform data between formats before submitting data to the ML models and then get the results in your applications . This work is time-consuming and moving data in and out of data stores complicates governance and security . <h> How Amazon is Making Machine Learning More Accessible <p> AWS has a new approach to easily add machine learning to machine learning predictions with applications and business intelligence dashboards . AWS allows developers to combine tools like Amazon QuickSight , Aurora and Athena with SQL queries . These make it easier to add ML predictions without the need to build custom integrations , learn separate tools , write complex code , move data , and one can do it without any experience in machine learning . Developers can now access more variety of data than they already could without additional coding making the development process fast and more manageable . <p> Amazon 's Aurora is a MySQL compatible database that automatically takes data into the application to run a machine learning model assigned by a developer . Next , the developers can obtain additional datasets more easily from the company 's serverless system , Athena . The final step is QuickAight , which is Amazon 's data visualisation tool . The combination of these three tools provides a far more efficient approach to the development of the machine learning models . <p> For example , the lead scoring model in sales is where you pick the most likely targets to convert to sales . Using machine learning prediction you do n't have to write any additional code , that would adapt to different codes incompatible with each other aka the ' glue code ' . You just have to take the lead scoring model built by the data science team then deploy it to SageMaker and order all sales queues by priority based on a prediction from the model . Wood says , "" Today , to do lead scoring you have to go off and wire up all these pieces together to be able to get the predictions into the application . "" With this new capability , you can get there much faster . <p> Explaining further , "" Now , as a developer , I can just say that I have this lead scoring model which is deployed in SageMaker , and all I have to do is write literally one SQL statement that I do all day long into Aurora , and I can start getting back that lead scoring information . And then I just display it in my application and away I go , "" <h> Advantages of this approach <p> As pointed out by Amazon , this process makes the machine learning simple and more accessible to the developers all around the world . With broader access to a large number of datasets , the development part has become much faster , and no additional code sequences need to be called . Anyone who can know how to write SQL can use machine learning predictions in their applications without custom code and can focus on other parts of the process with more efficiency . <p> On the business intelligence front , a lot of Amazon customers fuss how it 's frustrating to build and manage prediction pipelines before getting predictions from a model . On average , these developers spend days writing application code to move data between models and applications ; Amazon QuickSight can be used instead to visualise and report all ML predictions . <h> Enjoyed this story ?

"<h> Economic conclave : Data is the New Oil <p> The title of this column is the title of a presentation made by Nandan Nilekani at the Delhi Economics Conclave last week . The conclave is an annual conference hosted by the Ministry of Finance , and brings together economists , academics , policy makers , researchers and regulators . It 's a tradition started by the Ministry in recent years , and the sessions are packed with topical ideas , discussions and debates . Two years ago , the conclave was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi . This year the keynote speeches were given by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley , and by Tharman Shanmugaratnam , the Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore . One of the theme this year , was on the future of cash , anchored around an insightful presentation by Professor Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard , who is the author of "" The Curse of Cash "" . Naturally India 's demonetisation loomed large in the ensuing discussion . <p> But it was Nilekani 's presentation that absolutely enthralled the audience . He is best known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aadhaar . He is also the author of the 2009 book "" Imagining India : The Idea of a Renewed Nation "" and more recently co-authored "" Rebooting India : Realising a Billion Aspirations "" . The idea captured in his rather provocative title has been evident in his writings for quite some time . Recently , Nilekani gave a similar talk in his convocation address at IIT Madras . The launch of Reliance Jio 's inexpensive smartphone for a billion people the same week was perhaps an ordained coincidence ! The Economist magazine of London , too , had a recent cover story hinting at "" data as the new oil "" . Nilekani repeated many times that India is on the verge of a digital revolution and will go swiftly from being a data-poor to a data-rich country . That data represents immense business opportunities . <p> The modern digital economy is throwing up so much data , which itself has become the raw material for new businesses based on data analytics . In the last century , a new resource was discovered , which spawned a fast-growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resource , found in mother earth , was oil . It led to hugely profitable mega corporations and near monopoly powers . It also influenced the geopolitics of the world for several decades . But oil is a depletable , non-renewable resource . And the world is moving to renewable energy for transportation . Just like oil spawned mega business and corporations , in the New World , "" data "" is the new resource driving the growth of large corporations . In this digital world , already Google , Apple , Amazon , Facebook and Microsoft are the five most valuable companies in the world with collective value of almost three trillion dollars . Their combined annual profits are more than hundred billion dollars . Behind the Chinese firewall , Alibaba and Tencent are the other two big giants . Almost ninety percent of all growth in advertising revenue in the United States , goes to just two companies , Google and Facebook . <p> Netflix which began as a "" piping "" company providing broadband connection , has also become a major producer of movie and video content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic originated by Netflix . This company knows who is watching what , when , how . It can anticipate the preferences and make suggestions , much like Amazon suggests what to buy , based on your buying behaviour , captured by the data trail you left on the company 's computers . In a short span of about 10 years , the data analytics focus has also changed . It was used to mine viewing habits so as to pitch advertisements and products via micromarketing to web users . Now the purpose of analytics , which combines artificial intelligence and machine learning , is to help consumers find appropriate services and products at the right price . AI can predict what you need to buy , or when your car needs to be serviced . <p> Nilekani says , thanks to initiatives like Aadhaar , India already has the infrastructure to clock data at a massive scale . Much will depend on what we , or businesses , do with that data . For instance , in the GST Network , there will be a billion transactions recorded every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by whom , at what price . Combined with the Fastag and Electronic Tollway systems , we will also track the physical movement . This could potentially help the Central Statistical Organisation to collect data on GDP on a real time basis . It 's like seeing economic activity on a dashboard . The Aadhaar system is authenticating almost 50 million transactions every day , and this is growing exponentially . Imagine Ola and Uber drivers who choose to display their past driving record tagged by Aadhaar authenticated transactions . Or imagine a low-income borrower with no collateral , who can provide a digital trail of past payments of bills and taxes to show that he or she is a "" responsible and creditworthy "" borrower . Use of social media data in providing microloans has begun in China . In India , there are 10 new licensed payment banks which will be doing millions of transactions every month , involving remittances , clearing , investment in mutual funds , deposits and so on . They can use the digital data thus generated to fine tune their product offerings better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities are limitless . Unlike oil , data is an infinite resource which will never deplete . The economics of data as business resource is yet to be fully understood . But businesses that have recognised the potential are already galloping ahead . Nilekani 's main caution was that we must ensure genuine data democracy and avoid data colonisation . Which means that the data ownership must be with the user whose transaction generates the data , and not with megalith corporations like Google or Facebook . If companies want to use your data , this should be on the basis of consent . Users should be free to disconnect from any platform , and carry their data with another competing platform company . This requires appropriate legislation that clearly defines who has the rights to use the data that a user generates by his or her transactions . On the issue of privacy , the speaker was silent , since the case is being heard in the Supreme Court . Clearly a great transformation awaits digital India in the next five years , and it is all centered around a resource called "" data "" ."

He spoke like a true businessman , or a rather a true Fujian , seeking a better return on investment -- preferred in millions of dollars if the currency is an option . <p> Nevertheless , with millions onboarding data services and apps in India every month , the world 's second most populous country is a priority market for ByteDance . So much so , it has designed and launched Helo , a regional entertainment content platform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helo is the same as Toutiao , its wildly successful content app back home in China , but the features , user interface , and product are tailored for a random Ajit Kumar . <p> In less than four months of its launch , the Helo app is ranked No. 2 among the top free apps on the Google PlayStore by downloads . ( Over 90% of smartphones in India run on Android , Google 's phone operating system . ) Helo has over 20 million downloads since and records two million daily active users , said a person aware of Helo 's expansion plans but asked to stay anonymous . It has still some way to catch up with Sharechat , India 's top local language social app , with some 7.5 million DAUs three months ago but Helo 's performance has experts in the space sitting up and watching . <p> What 's more , ByteDance is spending freely its marketing dollars to acquire more users on the platform . <p> Zhang Yiming , founder of ByteDance <p> Helo is what you could call a China version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case , being Sharechat . The content on Helo is strikingly similar to what you would find on other regional content apps like Sharechat , DailyHunt , and Clip , to name a few . The difference : Helo is powered by arguably the world 's best technology algorithms in the space . <p> Helo is tracking the Sharechat trajectory . "" The thesis behind Sharechat is ' There is content and there is a community for that content . ' That 's why a copycat can launch and get market share , "" the person quoted above said . In fact , ByteDance came very close to investing in the latest round of Sharechat funding before deciding to launch its own app . <p> If you are surprised why you have never heard of Helo , it 's likely because you are not its target audience . Like Sharechat , Helo targets vernacular , small town , and new data users . Most likely found on a low-end Android smartphone , Helo is powered up when the data newbies have time to kill . <p> Take the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pune . Her phone has Sharechat , Helo , Clip , and WhatsApp and she says she prefers apps like Helo and Sharechat over WhatsApp because "" there 's news , jokes and funny videos of kids and old people "" on the platforms . "" WhatsApp is where people send long , political messages . Helo and Sharechat , on the other hand , are 100% timepass , "" Behere says . <p> In Alwar , Rajasthan , Tejpal Singh , who drives a school pick-up van , says he was surprised by the regional content on Helo . Singh , who stumbled on the app through a Facebook ad , just last week , describes the content on the app as positive and entertaining . "" There is a lot of negative content on YouTube and Facebook . Too much anti-religion content . This app shows some good posts like funny marriage jokes , job alerts , Bollywood content like old pictures of Amitabh Bachchan ... "" <h> Helo 's India plan <p> Helo may be only about four months old but ByteDance has had a longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vigo Live in September 2017 . ByteDance acquired Musical.ly in November last year for a $1 billion . Popular among teens , Musical.ly a video-focused social media network had around 15 million registered users in India as of February 2018 . <p> Top 10 apps on Google Playstore . Source : Sensortower <p> ByteDance did not agree to interviews for this story . <p> But , people around the company pointed to how it had cranked up its engine tom-tomming Helo . "" The company is spending anywhere between $5 million to $10 million as marketing expense in India and a majority of this expense is spent towards Helo , "" said the person quoted earlier . Helo has also had the best rate of retention of users so far , this person said , but this could not be confirmed by a second source . <p> It 's important to note that Helo is powered by one of the best technology giants in the world , known for its speed of execution . Though the ByteDance product team is based in Beijing , it has operations being run from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> "" ByteDance is a tech giant in China but they move with the speed of a startup . It 's a combination of a big company that has resources and money and agility and speed of a startup , "" said the person attributing this agility as the reason for Helo 's success . <p> ByteDance 's Toutiao , a content curation app that has over 120 million DAUs boasts of its users spending 74 minutes daily on the app . That 's more than average user spends on Facebook and more than twice the time they spend on Snapchat . Toutiao 's algorithms go a step beyond serving up content . During the 2016 Olympics , a Toutiao bot wrote news stories covering the event quicker than traditional media outlets and received read rates in par with these outlets . <p> The app uses machine and deep learning algorithms to source content that users will find most relevant . Much like Toutiao , Helo does n't depend on user information like demographics , age or gender to find relevant content for its users . The underlying technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent on articles , taps , swipes , pauses , comments , interaction on content posts , among other cues . <p> ByteDance 's algorithms have reached a level of sophistication where a user will find at least 10% of recommended posts as relevant , said Tony Li , founder of Geek2Startup , an entrepreneur community in China . Banking on this technology stack and regional content readily available across several popular platforms combined with marketing dollars , Helo has climbed the ranks . It has a team in India working to understand the nuances of the local market . <p> Li predicted that ByteDance has a higher chance of success in India as compared to Tencent ' s WeChat , which has disappeared into the sunset in India after its initial success . Globalisation is the next natural step for Toutiao after its China success . He points to the strong run TikTok has had in US . Key will be meeting the regional content demand here , added Li . <p> Google and KPMG in a report in March 2017 predict that the market of local language internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving English content users ( 199 million by then ) far behind . Rural Indian language internet users already have higher engagement spending 328 minutes a week on chat apps , social media , online entertainment , and news , as against 308 minutes spent by urban users . <p> Helo is not available in English . It is available in 14 regional languages and dialects : Hindi , Marathi , Gujarati , Bhojpuri , Hariyanvi , Rajasthani , Odia , Punjabi , Tamil , Telugu , Malayalam , Kannada , Bengali , and Assamese . Its feed , a mix of jokes , memes , funny GIFs and videos , Shayari , click-baity film gossip , comes from various other platforms . <p> "" The platform crawls and sources content from Sharechat , Instagram , DailyHunt , Clip among other platforms , "" the person quoted earlier said . The company also has its own content team that sources vernacular content based on the local understanding of the market . <p> "" ( ByteDance ) is spending rapidly on acquiring users in India in a space that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proven the potential of regional content apps , "" said Satish Meena of Forrester Research . Meena said that the Helo 's target users are mainly in Tier 2 and 3 towns and are roped in through ads on YouTube and Facebook . A lot of these are likely to be paid installs , added Meena , where the company hires a marketing agency to drive targeted installs . <p> As a product specifically tailored for rural Indians or new internet users , the Helo app is fairly simple to navigate through . It does n't ask to sign up or log-in when a new user first lands up on the app . <p> If you look at Sharechat and Helo , the app designs are very similar to TikTok where the landing page of the app is always "" trending "" content , noted Akash Senpaty , a product manager at Zynga and an expert at taking apart apps . Helo has also borrowed features from Twitter where a user can add comment on a post being shared . Senpaty said that even though these features can probably increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WhatsApp groups . Users are generally part of WhatsApp groups with similar interests and content relevant to those interests . What Toutiao -- or Helo -- is supposed to do by the tuning algorithms to a high fidelity , WhatsApp groups do with crowdsourced human intelligence with far more stickiness , Senapaty pointed out . <p> Apart from GIFs and videos , the app also tags timely and trending news content -- for instance , the ongoing #metoo movement in India , live cricket updates , and political developments . <p> Like Twitter , there are trending hashtags on the app that indicate politically inclined content : for example , content tagged with #OurModiDelivers or #BJPLayiBerojgari . The platform also has verified and official accounts of users . <h> Vernacular content : Undifferentiated ! <p> The two years since the launch of Reliance Jio 's 4G network services has been nothing short of a data revolution in India . The millions of Indian users -- new and old -- on the mobile internet today also opened up a whitespace between messengers such as WhatsApp and social media apps like Facebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penetration dramatically increased in the country and new internet users were looking for something to do on their smartphones . <p> Offering users a continuous stream of an entertainment feed , Toutiao found initial success among smaller cities and towns in China where the company could advertise cheaply . In its first year , the company acquired its first million users by spending only 1 million RMB ( $160,000 ) in promotions . Most of Toutiao 's users -- about 72% -- are located in China 's bottom-tier cities . The same holds true for Helo 's audience in India , except that Sharechat has the first mover advantage here . <p> Sharechat founded in 2015 as a chatbot used by a few thousand users has grown to a well-funded company clocking 7.5 million DAUs as of July this year . Sharechat steadily built momentum by building a platform that curated regional content . <p> "" The Chinese are still in hyper-growth mode , by scraping content from here and there to show a semblance of activity , "" said Himanshu Gupta , a former WeChat executive . WeChat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tussle with ByteDance due to the latter 's increasing dominance in China 's social media and online entertainment industry . <p> "" To get a content-based platform play right you need creators to generate content , curation and moderation of content , and consumers to view content on such social platform , "" Gupta said . "" Chinese are skipping the first two steps by scraping content and putting them via bots and focusing on the third part . "" <p> The first person quoted in this story also confirmed this about ByteDance 's execution style . The content business is a combination of three parts : the creation of content on the app , the ability to distribute and deliver relevant content to users using algorithms , and promoting the app , this person said . <p> Thanks to ByteDance 's phenomenal success in China backed by the power of its algorithms , Helo has the advantage of getting at least two of those three things right . It has the money to acquire users in India market and it has a tech stack that has helped it achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day on the Toutiao app . <p> Still , differentiation is a casualty . "" At present , there 's a lot of overlap in terms of content on Helo , Sharechat and other user-generated content apps . There is no major differentiation as such , "" said a rival startup founder , who asked to stay anonymous . "" In the long run , it is important for these platforms to be able to monetise these users , which will be challenging given that there is n't much stickiness based on the core propositions of these apps . "" <p> Also , in the months or quarters ahead , Helo 's parent will face pressures of a different kind : ByteDance that generated a revenue of $2.5 billion in 2017 is gearing up for an initial public offering , pointed out the first person quoted in this story without a name . An IPO will mean pressure to shore up profits and cut down on spending . So , even if Helo manages to outnumber Sharechat and secure the top spot in regional content in India , monetisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

"<h> Can Machine Learning Spur The Development Of Single Crystals ? <p> Controlling and observing single crystal growth in laboratories has many applications from manufacturing turbine blades to semiconductors . The advancement in the computational power of the modern day computers owes in large to the advanced material engineering techniques . <p> Growing single crystals is one such innovation , which is labour intensive and time-consuming . <h> Why Is It Difficult To Grow Crystals <p> Popular crystallizing techniques such as vapour diffusion , slow cooling , slow evaporation have been put to great use after years of research and most often than not trial and error based experiments . <p> Theoretically , crystallization should start when the concentration of a compound in a solvent is higher than the solubility product of this compound . Generally , however , crystallization is kinetically hindered and crystals grow only from supersaturated solutions . There are several ways to achieve this metastable state of supersaturation . <p> The easiest is increasing the concentration by evaporation of the solvent until crystallization sets in . Crystal growing depends on many factors . To begin with , there are parameters like raw material ratio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maximum temperature residence time and physicochemical properties such as elemental electronegativity , atomic radius , elements melting point , elemental volatility , the position of the atom in the periodic table among many others . <p> This problem resonates with something that is prevalent in many machine learning models- the curse of dimensionality . As the number of deciding factors to analyse increase , the complexity involved in achieving a satisfactory outcome increases . And , modern computing machines ( along with on-premise data centres , cloud etc ) coupled algorithmic advantage is built to do exactly the same ; churn complexities and make sense out of data . <h> How Does ML Help <p> The researchers used data like growth temperature curves , raw elemental compositions and ratios , and growth conditions . <p> The authors in this paper , experimented with support vector machine ( SVM ) , decision trees , random forests and gradient boosting decision tree to analyse which of the above factors really make a difference in crystal growth . <p> Accuracy , f1-scores , recall rates were used for successful sample predictions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fare against each other via paper by TangShi Yao et al. , <p> The results show that : <p> The SVM method is relatively stable and works well , with an accuracy of 81% in predicting experimental results . By comparison , the accuracy of laboratory reaches 36% . The decision tree model is also used to reveal which features will take critical roles in growth processes . <p> 10-fold cross-validation was used to analyze the model . The single SVM model used to predict experimental results has an accuracy of 80% in describing all the reaction types in its test-set data . The average accuracy over 10 training/validation split is 73% . <h> Future of ML In Physics <p> Earlier this year , researchers have demonstrated the use of deep learning for building nuclear reactors where an AI approach was undertaken with a greater focus for the Tokamak reactor , a doughnut-shaped machine that holds hot plasma using a powerful magnetic field . <p> High dimensional data like the temperature of electrons as a function of radius in the plasma from previous fusion experiments is fed into the Fusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplemented with the NVIDIA 's V100 GPUs as the task is computationally intensive and would require high-performance computing clusters . From condensed matter physics to plasma physics , deep learning methods are proving to be more efficient and economical than the conventional methods ."
"<h> Robots to do 52% of jobs by 2025 , says WEF report <p> Web Desk September 17 , 2018 11:32 IST <p> Representational image <p> For three decades now , James Cameron 's Terminator franchise has kept millions entertained and alarmed about a world where machines dominate mankind . And the march to robots increasing their hold on human activities is continuing in the real world -- a World Economic Forum report has said by 2025 , machines will handle 52 per cent of current work tasks , displacing almost 75 million people from the workplace . <p> However , its not all ominous for mankind as rapid advances in computer technology will also create 133 million new jobs between now and 2022 , in place of the 75 million jobs that will be lost to robots taking over roles . <p> The WEF 's Future of Jobs 2018 report notes the sectors most vulnerable to the ' takeover ' of human roles by robots will be accounting , client management and industrial , postal and secretarial functions .

"<h> Winning micro-moments in mobile e-commerce <p> Mihir Shinde , a technology executive &amp; entrepreneur with over 10 years of experience in the e-commerce space , says that the degree to which a mobile device can influence the buying decision of a user has never been greater . <p> Mihir is currently a Forbes Tech Council Member , a Royal Society Fellow as well as a Techstars Mentor . He currently works as the Head of Mobile Apps &amp; Strategy for B&amp;H Photo Video in New York . His work has been featured in both Apple 's WWDC and Google I/O conferences &amp; he has written for Forbes in the past as well . In addition , he is also the cofounder of Nandoo -- a one of a kind wellness ecommerce mobile app that is targeted for Indian Millennials . <p> The author of two books on e-commerce , took the time to speak to Fortune India Exchange about how the next big wave in mobile e-commerce is all about focusing on the micro-moments for mobile users . <p> Before we even address micro-moments , could you talk to us about the impact mobile devices have had on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's simply astounding how much of a dependency we have on our smartphones nowadays . <p> Research has indicated that roughly 68% of smartphone users said that they check their phone within 15 minutes of waking up in the morning , &amp; 30% admit that they feel anxiety when they do n't have their phone on them . <p> Whenever there 's a smidgen of a doubt in the consumer 's head , the first thing they do is whip out their smartphones &amp; start conducting the research . Nowadays , when the consumer enters even the retail store , they mostly do so in an informed fashion often conducting a lot of research beforehand on their phones . In a way , the footsteps that consumers used to take throughout the store to go &amp; peruse have been transformed to research conducted on mobile phones in this digital age . <p> Could you tell us about micro-moments &amp; why they are important ? <p> Micro-moment is a term that was coined by Google . They are basically moments where people reflexively turn to a device , which happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act on a need to learn something , do something , discover something , watch something , or buy something . These are intent driven moments where the probability of decisions being made is very high . <p> We do a lot more searches on mobile devices than on desktops . Whenever in doubt or if we need or want something , we go to our mobile devices . We check our phone approximately 150 times a day &amp; spend roughly 177 minutes on it each day just rummaging through streams of digital content . These stats mean that mobile sessions average about 1 minute &amp; 10 seconds long , several times a day . A lot of these moments consists of quick interactions such as uploading a video on Facebook , quickly WhatsApping someone , sending out an email whenever you have a few minutes from your daily routine , etc. which are n't really the best time to engage with brands , primarily because if a brand does then it will simply be dismissed . Relevance is key . There are other moments , where users are open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want help making our choices or coming to decisions . These are the moments that brands have to be ready for . <p> How do companies need to adapt their marketing strategy in order to work with micro-moments ? <p> Customization is very important here since it helps with key relevance . Companies need to really think about what the goal of the marketing strategy is &amp; how they can work towards that goal by catching users during their research phase . Research phase for these users shows an intent &amp; companies need to understand what the intent is so that they can target their marketing prowess accordingly . <p> One very important thing that I would like to mention is that it takes a whole hearted effort to get this going . Companies need to understand that you need cross functioning teams in order to make this happen since a lot of the tools , in order to get the whole job done well , lie with departments outside of marketing ( e.g. Technology , Operations , Customer Service ) . Such a concerted effort is a must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Does this mean that the non-mobile experiences , such as desktop , need to be less prioritized ? <p> Nope ! In fact , there is a role that desktop ( and other avenues ) still play . What mobile does is simply help get the user more informed &amp; with companies taking advantage of micro-moments , hopefully they can help the user in making the decision . However , the conversion is something that may or may not happen necessarily on the mobile platform -- it could very well happen on the desktop or perhaps even in-store . <p> In fact , research shows the following stats : <p> * 90% of people say they use multiple screens for everyday activities , such as booking a hotel or shopping for electronics <p> * 40% of people who research on a smartphone go on to purchase on a desktop <p> Instead of simply thinking of mobile &amp; desktop separately , its users need to basically be thought of as belonging in the same bucket . Companies need to rethink about how they measure &amp; evaluate the success of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their decisions up to the last second before a purchase is made . Nearly one in four shoppers have changed their mind about buying something while in the checkout line simply by reading something on their mobile devices . New conversion types must be accounted for &amp; companies should really think about measurement in a way that takes cross channel into consideration . And like I mentioned before , organizing your teams around this new way of thinking is a must too . <p> In addition to being an expert in mobile e-commerce , you are also the brains behind creating Nandoo- a pretty unique wellness / e-commerce platform for Indian users . Tell us the thought process behind building it . <p> I came across a study by Cigna TKK that found out that nearly 95% of Indian millennials admitted to being stressed -- most millennials than any other nation in the world ! It 's an alarming statistic , especially for a nation that founded relaxation techniques like mindfulness , meditation and yoga . One of the biggest triggers for this was Work . After logging long working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal life . Millennials prefer jobs that helps boost their personal as well as professional skills . But when their work does n't allow that , it makes them dissatisfied and leads to stress . And so , I realized that while I could n't do anything about the type of job &amp; satisfaction from it , I could leverage my mobile app &amp; ecommerce experience to create a unique Wellness based app . <p> We looked into what are the simplest things missing from Indian millennials ' lives that could be very easy to do but help reap massive benefits . After conducting research , we felt the best most organized way to approach this would be to categorize &amp; hit three main factors : Mind , Body &amp; Soul . Again , we wanted to keep it simple to start off with , so we added one easy to do exercise for each factor . For example , for Mind , we added a section where we deconstruct a complex topic in a simple , easy to understand manner -- WHY ? So that when our Nandoo-ers go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small talk conversations confidently . <p> For Body , we added a step tracker which you had to do for only 10 mins a day and utilize your efforts for an ecommerce experience wherein you get small gift cards for those efforts . For Soul , we added an intuitive breathing bubble which would help the millennials relax &amp; de-stress . <p> Our goal behind this application is for the millennials to adopt &amp; more importantly benefit from it . If we can just help bring that stress percentage down a bit , that would be a goal well met for us ! <p> How do you see Nandoo extending and what are some of the mobile strategies you are currently leveraging for it ? <p> We have received great traction for the application where we 're close to hitting 250k users in the span of just 6 months . This is an overwhelming response &amp; we could n't have hoped for a better start . Most , if not all of this traction , has come through word of mouth . <p> Next on the horizon is to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feedback &amp; build out features that we feel might add great value to the overall health &amp; wellness of our Nandoo-ers . One immediate thing we are working on and hope to address shortly is how to cater for the varying internet connectivity regardless of location . This has been a herculean task , but we are loving what we are learning and excited to unveil it soon . <p> In the longer term , we want to start incorporating more advanced technological innovations , such as artificial intelligence &amp; machine learning into the mix to help provide more personalized recommendations to our users so that they can get every last mile of benefits from Nandoo . We also want to keep the application more engaging &amp; we feel that augmented reality has a huge part to play in it . The recent product announcements made by Apple &amp; Google for mobile applications seem very promising , so the future looks bright on the mobile side for sure !"
"<p> The adoption of AI is increasing rapidly across the world with no industry remaining untouched by its impact . Most enterprises are already in agreement that artificial intelligence can bring unparalleled value to their organisation . However , the concerns over bias in AI systems and their efficiency are also not new . <p> A recent study shows that while 67 percent of consumers worry about AI discriminating against them , and 64 percent fear that AI will make decisions that affect them without their knowledge . <p> Sanjay Srivastava , CDO at Genpact does n't think of AI as artificial intelligence , he thinks of it as augmented intelligence - which augments a human 's capabilities with machine learning and AI for example . <p> AI and data analytics can bring possible solutions to us at amazing speed , but ' the last mile , ' the actual decision , he believes , still belongs to humans only and it is how enterprises can truly act with confidence . <p> In pop culture , AI is many times seen as a technology that will take over the world or will go rogue . However , that seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitfalls and real threats of AI adoption that companies should be wary of ? <p> One way to think about this is AI is a prediction capability -- and as good as it can be , it will always require judgment and action in responding to that prediction -- something that will always fall back to humans . This is the concept of "" humans in the loop "" and in the end , ensures the proper use of augmented intelligence . <p> But like anything else , you need to be thoughtful about how and where you apply AI . For example , in governance and ethics : Consumers and governments alike are becoming increasingly concerned about how data is being used by AI-driven technologies . The concerns are so great -- with issues ranging from algorithms that drive credit limits , to the use of facial recognition software for myriad reasons -- that governmental bodies around the world are taking action . <p> To help eliminate stakeholders ' and consumers ' worries about unethical or biased data use , we expect that many organizations will add Digital Ethics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple responsibilities : implementing ethical frameworks to make appropriate decisions about new technologies ; addressing considerations like data security and bias ; looking ahead to future technology challenges ; building new standards of technology governance ; and establishing new check-and-balance systems to ensure preventative measures remain effective <p> Challenge in adoption and need for modularization : The top barriers to AI adoption are the lack of skills to design , implement , and maintain AI solutions , and no clarity on where to use AI effectively . And so , we need to think about AI in modules -- in small components that can re-aggregate into larger business processes . <p> In many cases we have seen that AI suffers from a digital version of biases that hurt the physical world . How should tech leaders approach AI in such a way that there are no biases ? <p> I foresee that corporate boards are going to start thinking about ethical governance very differently . <p> As AI continues to increase its influence on business decisions , governments are taking steps to ensure that all AI usage is ethical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective decision-making without misuse of data . With these frameworks , businesses can build trust with consumers , which supports AI adoption , but also brand reputation . <p> As part of ethical AI frameworks , business leaders must encourage diversity . The goal is to have complete and comprehensive data samples that can cover all scenarios and users to eliminate bias . If we lack comprehensive data , external sources of synthetic data can fill in the gaps . Likewise , we should aim to have diverse teams with a wide range of skills and backgrounds , including digital and industry talent -- or better yet , people who can think from both sides . <p> Now more than ever , consumers expect business to do the right thing in all facets of their operations , and they will reward those that do so . Keeping ethics at the center of operations and technology implementation is essential . <p> AI and its ' impact on jobs ' , both terms have been synonymous for some time . Do you think AI is going to have a direct impact on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AI more ? <p> AI will have an impact on jobs , but not what most people think . My view is that the future of work will be less about AI impacting the number of jobs , and more about the need for humans to adapt their skill sets to leverage this digital age . <p> The successful workforce of the future will bring a trainable and curious mindset . Workers should n't fear AI or disruption but adopt a "" trainable "" and continuously curious mindset to prepare for a future of constant skills development and retraining . <p> Additionally , the way we learn will change , and businesses will put a greater emphasis on reskilling , upskilling and virtual training . However , mandated , one-size-fits-all reskilling and training programs do n't enable employees to discover their skills , identify their gaps , and hone their potential through customized knowledge paths and plans . <p> With Genome , Genpact 's internal learning framework , we are continuously preparing internally for the future of work by enabling our talent to acquire new skills and evolve quickly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Genpact 's more than 90,000 employees . <p> Genpact also announced that it is opening part of its internal learning platform , Genome , to the public"
"<h> A Beginner 's Guide To Attention And Memory In Deep Learning <h> Read Next <p> It might have never occurred to you how you could make sense of what your friend is blabbering at a loud party . There are all kinds of noises in a party ; then how come we are perfectly able to carry out a conversation ? This question is known widely as the ' cocktail party problem ' . Most of our cognitive processes can pay attention to only a single activity at a time . In the case of a party house , our capability of directing attention towards one set of words while ignoring other sets of words , which are often overpowering , is still a conundrum . <p> The key cognitive processes to solve a cocktail party problem are attention and short-term memory . This concept of attention and memory is a recurring theme in most of our daily processes . Being able to figure out what one sees or hears by just paying attention to chunks of information rather than the whole string of it , helps one react in real time . In short , it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a huge challenge when it comes to computational systems . <p> For machines , it 's all 0s and 1s and still , the concept of attention as we know it can be incorporated into them with well crafted algorithms . <p> Attention and memory have emerged as two vital new components of deep learning over the last few years . <p> The ability to focus on one thing and ignore others has a vital role in guiding cognition . Not only does this allow us to pick out salient information from noisy data ( cocktail party problem ) , it also allows us to pursue one thought at a time , remember one event rather than all events . <p> Attention in terms of neural networks can be thought of as a vector with important weights . The weights tell the network where to look at ( attention ) , and which pixel in an image or a word in a sentence to look at . The attention vector is used to predict how strongly it is related to other elements and approximate the target . <h> Attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DeepMind <p> Deep nets naturally learn a form of implicit attention where they respond more strongly to some parts of the data than others . <p> RNNs contain a recursive hidden state and learn functions from sequences of inputs ( e.g. a speech signal ) to sequences of outputs ( e.g. words ) . The underlying task here is to calculate a sequential Jacobian of an event . <p> The sequential Jacobian , which is a set of derivatives , shows which past inputs they remember when predicting current outputs . It is represented as follows : <p> Where x and y denotes the input and output vectors respectively . <p> The network produces an extra output vector used to parametrise an attention model . The attention model then operates on some data ( image , audio sample , text to be translated ... ) to create a fixed-size "" glimpse "" vector that is passed to the network as input at the next time step . The complete system is recurrent , even if the network is n't . <p> The model consists of a trainable embedding layer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recurrent neural network ( SHA-RNN ) , and a softmax classifier . The model uses a single head of attention and a modified feedforward layer similar to that in a Transformer , which is referred to as a Boom layer . Boom layer takes a vector from small ( 1024 ) to big ( 4096 ) to small ( 1024 ) . <p> The Boom layer is related strongly to the large feed-forward layer found in Transformers and other architectures . <p> Applications of employing attention and memory modules into the network : <p> Transformers , the models that have revolutionised NLP use attention mechanisms . When released in 2017 , it set new benchmarks for machine translations . This innovation even led to better models such as BERT , GPT and many more ."
"<h> The real casualty of the Covid seems to be the newspaper . A sense of tragedy is lost in the celebration of the technological . <p> The Corona epidemic becomes an intensive time to watch people . One learns interesting things about how people perceive themselves and the world around them . One of them recently told me that for him , "" the empirical was banal and dailyness was repetitive . Even the empirical had to be read at the level of the symbolic and the institutional . "" <p> Social meteorology <p> I was intrigued , my friend chuckled on the phone . He said , "" Think for a minute . It 's not people who are the only objects of the Corona and its havoc . Its focus is on perceptions and institutions . "" The biggest victim of the Corona is the State . No critic has exposed the ineptness of the State as effectively as the Corona . The best criticism of Uddhav Thackeray and Tamil Nadu 's Palaniswami is Covid-19 . <p> My friend added , "" this will be a new kind of social meteorology indicating the health of institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social Responsibility ( CSR ) was Covid , and the corporations turned out to be bereft of ideas , except for a pretentious notion of housework which was indifferent to gender . He rambled on exploring his thesis . <p> He stopped and suddenly asked me , "" As a sociologist tell me , where is the biggest change ? "" I mumbled tiredly , "" the city "" . He laughed triumphantly . He said , "" No . It is the newspaper . "" He gave me a lecture , a mini-seminar , which I shall now develop . The newspaper is no longer about the news . "" Today , India is being subject to virus epidemics , war on borders , locust invasions as pestilence , and cyclones on the coastline . The gas leaks would have been the fifth , but they were minor , modest next to Bhopal . "" <p> My friend said it is the time of catastrophe , yet the news has become so banal . It is banalised by numbers . If a policy uses numbers in a way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of survey and the social trend becomes an adjunct to the State , in fact , a willing adjutant of policy . The newspapers are otherwise silent . They report everything like extensions of officialdom . They pretend of normalcy that does not exist . They sound like they 're in the grip of Thanatos , oscillating between the obituary and the pathologist report . Death and devastation are their concern , but the banality of both is obvious . <p> Banality of news <p> The news sounds like a collection of social work handouts . This is sad because the newspaper was the greatest celebration of democracy we had . India literally voted through print . He added , "" In recent times , the only sense of mourning , laughter and life was when two film stars died . Bollywood rescued news . The reports on Irrfan Khan and Sushant Singh Rajput made news come alive . "" They were treated as model dramas , a source of mourning and debate . In this context , a person died . There was mourning , not a litany of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coming years , we will mourn the decline of the newspaper . A way of life is being lost , and the Covid has announced it . ( File photo : Reuters ) <p> Beyond the cases of Rajput and Irrfan , the news of the everyday is lifeless . You could substitute reports and hardly recognise the difference . Analysts I talked to brought a further twist to the argument . They listed that the change is not political but technological . "" Newspapers "" , they claimed , "" were mourning the death of print and announcing the real birth of the digital . "" <p> "" Covid "" , they claimed , "" has announced the birth of the digital era . The virus did not cause it , it merely formalised it . The new society has to be online . "" I admit , as an old addict of print , that I was shocked . I only get up in the morning because of filter coffee and a sheaf of newspapers . Print defined a sense of the social , and now analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> One of the first things that I keep encountering is the frequent use of the word "" the new normal "" . The government is calling for a return to normalcy when the virus has still got two months to peaking point . What has arrived is social media . What has been announced is the web in air . The web in the air is the new normalcy , the acceptable epidemic of academic and corporate life . One feels like a dinosaur if one has not performed this rite of passage to the new post-normal world . <p> The university has declared the post-normalcy by announcing seminars and digital classes . There is no question of transition or training . Look at the announcements of the Vice Chancellors . One says that the distinction between print and digital is over . Another literally adds , "" by becoming digital we are "" . Even the advertisements are signalling a transition to a different way of life . Corporate dons have announced the age of artificial intelligence . It is as if the virus , while not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology like a tabula rasa . The newspaper as an organism senses this , feeling its inadequacy before the social media . In the coming years , what we might mourn is the decline of the newspaper . Housewives will miss it as they want it to line the shelves . Old men will not read it in the parks . A way of life is being lost , the Covid has announced it .

"<h> A Complete Guide To Outlier Detection With Hands-On Implementation For Beginners <h> Read Next <p> To start off , one must need to know what an outlier is . An outlier is basically the value of a point or a data point who largely differs from the rest of the crowd . Let us try to understand this with an example : in a class of 20 students with heights ranging from 170cm to 215 cm . The average height is 175cm and the maximum is 195cm . So here , the one with 215cm largely differs from the group and thus the data point is called an outlier . Another term that is used prominently for an outlier is , "" anomaly "" . Also , a person with a height of 125 cm would have been considered as an outlier too . <p> Through this article , we will be discussing outliers , their impact and methods to treat the outlier present in the data . We will also demonstrate the hands-on implementation of these methods . <h> Impact of outliers <p> Now , let us understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to machine learning . <p> As we know that the data we use for training machine learning models is highly sensitive to missing or faux values , as it severely limits the accuracy of the model . For the same reason , we need to have a great understanding of the data we have . In that having a good understanding of outliers is equally important because outliers can severely affect the accuracy of the model that we desire to train . <p> Source : Medium <p> Here we see , 300 is clearly an outlier . I have also tried to show how an outlier really impacts the statistical dimensions of the data . An outlier largely impacts mean and thus standard deviation and obviously would do the same to variance . <p> Here just to give briefings : mean can be understood as the average of all the values , the median indicates the middlemost value in the data , the mode is the most repetitive value in the data . Standard deviation is the amount of variation of the values in the data that we are having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of given values is not that humongous but what to do when the number of data points is in tens of thousands . In such a case we can opt to identify outliers in the following ways : <h> How to identify Outliers and remove them ? <p> We simply can not always remove outliers just by seeing them . The method of removing the outliers differs from the type of data set you are working on . <p> But you can surely get hands of knowledge of a few really important methods . <p> If you look carefully at the bottom of the graph there you will see some red data points , these are exactly the ones who are under the lower quartile . We are not able to see them distinguishably because the number of green data points is the way for you to see the red ones . And moreover , the difference between the lower bound and the normal range is not that much for it to be clearly visible . <p> NOTE : <p> here we wanted to use the same parameters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use scatter plot when there are a lot of data points and especially when these data points lack variance . <p> We will be seeing and analyzing the rest two on a different dataset because not every data set can be used to show and implement all the methods . <p> Here standard deviation is helpful when there 's a normal distribution ( a bell-shaped curve ) that easily can be observed . <p> ( 10000 ? 3 is the shape of the data frame ) <p> #setting limits for outliers #constraining by using 3 std dev technique #one may take 2 std dev or even 4-5 std dev for the same , it totally depends on the type of the data being used **44;4198;TOOLONG ... print(upperlimit) <p> Another way of saying the same thing is to get data points that are more than 3 standard deviations away . <p> #the outliers <p> df(df.zscore&lt;-3) ( df.zscore&gt;3 ) <p> OUTPUT <p> Outliers Removed <p> This is exactly how one can identify outliers and according to the data and how the removal will impact , can remove the outliers . <h> Conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help beginners understand the concept of outliers , how to identify outliers and how to remove outliers . There are many more methods like IQR etc but these are sufficient for a beginner .

"<p> Adobe is on a mission to make Sensei the smart assistant -- by adding voice recognition capability to its applications and deep learning to a slew of tools . In fact , AI and machine learning was woven into most of the apps , whether it is for photo , video or illustration editing software . And buzzwords such as deep learning , neural networks and machine learning dominated every application . The reason was abundantly clear at the recently concluded , largestAdobe MAX 2017 conference at Las Vegas . Over the last two years , Adobe has significantly ramped up its AI engine -- Adobe Sensei , that powers most of its new features . <p> Shantanu Narayen , Adobe CEO believes artificial intelligence is going to be an amplifier and not some substitute for human creation . "" We think artificial intelligence will evolve , to help you fill that need . Machines can see patterns and possibilities that we may not be able to see immediately and our artificial intelligence technology which is Adobe Sensei is going to be different and will harness the collective intelligence of the entire creative community , "" emphasized Narayen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cloud since it was first launched it five years ago . <h> Analytics India Magazine lists down a few of Adobe 's AI tools that harness the power of AI and help people push their creative boundaries <p> ProjectSceneStitch : One of the most revolutionary tools , Scene Stitch , powered by Adobe Sensei , is basically used to fill large holes in images by querying a database of images and automatically finding content to fill the hole . Adobe engineer Brian Price who demoed the project demonstrated how the Content Aware Fill tool , enables the designer to highlight a part of a photo which he/she wants to remove and SceneStitch can fill the hole with the scene around it . Powered by AI , Project SceneStich can replace sections of photo and replace it with other relevant photos from the database . The groundbreaking part is that the algorithm compares the image to an entire database of photos and replaces the part with a relevant photo . One of the most impressive image editing techniques , this tool which is still in prototype stage can potentially out-phase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adobe , Content Aware tool allows designers to more than just fill the hole in the image , it is a way of reimagining and remixing content . <p> Project Cloak : Want to get rid of an unwanted object in your video . Adobe 's Geoff Oxholm shows the way by selecting the spot and allowing Content Aware Fill tool to do the rest . It works brilliantly when there is something freestanding in front of the background and also an object or a shadow , one wants to remove , explained Oxholm . "" Cloak enables removing unwanted things from a video by imagining what would appear if these unwanted things were removed , "" Oxholm said during the conference . The modus operandi -- first the user has to create a mask that selects the object/area in the video one wants to remove , and then the Cloak software will automatically and intelligently replace that area in each frame . <p> Project Puppetron : Demoed by Jakub Fiser , this groundbreaking projected elicited the most laughs for its hilarious renditions of Pakistani American actor and stand-up comedian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max 2017 . Essentially , Puppetron is a way to combine a series of facial photos with artistic portraits to create puppets directly usable in Character Animator . Strikingly similar to what Prisma does , Puppetron 's algorithm can analyze a portrait done in line drawing or some other medium , and apply that same look to a regular portrait photograph . And the final representation is strikingly accurate . It can be seen from the image where modern art sketch stylization is applied to the photo and the remixed result is strikingly accurate . <p> Project DeepFill : So you heard about the magical Content Aware Fill . Well , now Adobe has taken it one step further and developed a new deep neural network-based image in-painting system , powered by Adobe Sensei , that a ) learns to generate image patches that are visually realistic and semantically reasonable , and b ) allows interactive customization of results based on users ' brushing and sketch inputs . Adobe 's Jiahui Yu demonstrated how DeepFill is an more sophisticated spin-off of Content Aware Fill tool that does n't really understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pixels into the hole . We believe a good image filling system should be able to understand the image . "" To bridge this gap and solve the challenging hole filling problem , we introduce Project Deep Fill that leverages the power of Adobe Sensei , Deep Learning and Neural Networks to develop a tool that can understand the image . Can it mask an entire eyebrow ? It can successfully hallucinate a new eyebrow for you , "" explained Yu , during the conference . <p> Project Scribbler : Scribbler is one of those tools that will definitely give more power to illustrators , sketch artists , graphic designers and revolutionize the way magazines , agencies and newsrooms work by speeding up the colorizing process . The interactive , deep learning-based image generation system powered by Adobe Sensei , gives users an easy way to express their ideas and visualize their designs by performing simple sketching , and drag-and-drop operations and colorizing the end result . Demonstrated by Jingwan Lu , this tool can not only colorize sketches but also black and white photos . Besides colorizing , Lu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object ( in this case a handbag ) by sketching and the color and the pattern to go with it . You can crop the pattern and paste just to give the neural network some hint what you want the bag to look like , she shared . <h> Outlook <p> Adobe 's CEO Narayen has always viewed AI as a game changer , the most disruptive paradigm shift that would drive its revenues and would help the software giant woo more customers . This is the reason behind the soaring popularity of Adobe Sensei that frees users from repetitive tasks and will soon the creative fabric of the design community .

"<h> Three New Books on Human Consciousness to Blow Your Mind <p> At the moment , you 're reading these words and , presumably , thinking about what the words and sentences mean . Or perhaps your mind has wandered , and you 're thinking about dinner , or looking forward to bingeing the latest season of The Good Place . But you 're definitely experiencing something . <p> How is that possible ? Every part of you , including your brain , is made of atoms , and each atom is as lifeless as the next . Your atoms certainly do n't know or feel or experience anything , and yet you -- a conglomeration of such atoms -- have a rich mental life in which a parade of experiences unfolds one after another . <p> The puzzle of consciousness has , of course , occupied the greatest minds for millennia . The philosopher David Chalmers has called the central mystery the "" hard problem "" of consciousness . Why , he asks , does looking at a red apple produce the experience of seeing red ? And more generally : Why do certain arrangements of matter experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the nature of consciousness will have been struck by the sheer variety of explanations on offer . Many prominent neuroscientists , cognitive scientists , philosophers , and physicists have put forward "" solutions "" to the puzzle -- all of them wildly different from , and frequently contradicting , each other . <p> Let 's begin with what might be called the standard view : The brain is extraordinarily complex , containing some 100 billion neurons , each of them capable of forming connections with ( and exchanging signals with ) 10,000 other neuronal units . Though the details are far from clear , it is presumed that neuronal activity gives rise to the mind . This is what Francis Crick famously called the "" astonishing hypothesis "" ( in his 1994 book of the same name ) : "" ' You , ' your joys and your sorrows , your memories and ambitions , your sense of personal identity and free will , are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules . "" <p> Much else is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer , by processing information -- and if so , does it mean that machines could one day be conscious ? Depends on who you ask . How widespread is consciousness within the animal kingdom , and when did it evolve in our own lineage ? Depends on who you ask . <p> There is n't even unanimous agreement that the hard problem is the stumper Chalmers makes it out to be ; cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett and philosopher Patricia Churchland , for example , have argued that the neuronal ebb and flow inside a healthy human brain simply "" is "" consciousness . ( Churchland offers an analogy from physics : Though it took centuries to understand light , we now realise that light simply is an oscillating electromagnetic field . ) Contrast that with philosopher Colin McGinn 's claim that humans might not have the cognitive wherewithal to comprehend their own minds ; The puzzle of consciousness , he believes , is here to stay . <p> OK , let 's dive in . Christof Koch is one of today 's leading thinkers on the problem of consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught for many years at the California Institute of Technology , and is now president and chief scientist at the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle . In his new book , The Feeling of Life Itself , Koch advocates for integrated information theory , or IIT , developed by Giulio Tononi , a neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin -- Madison . IIT does n't ask how matter gives rise to consciousness -- rather , it takes as a given certain attributes of consciousness , and asks what kinds of physical systems would be needed to support them . And it 's quantitative : The theory purports to measure the amount of consciousness in a physical system ( denoted by the Greek letter phi , F ) by linking specific physical states to specific conscious experiences . <p> There 's some degree of experimental support for this : Tononi has devised a sort of "" consciousness meter "" that attempts to measure F in humans . ( Or does it ? Koch confesses that it actually measures something called the "" perturbational complexity index , "" which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brain -- which Koch says is correlated with F. ) The device gives a low reading for those who are in a deep sleep , or under anesthetic , and a higher value for those who are wide awake . <p> More sophisticated versions of this device may be of great value , Koch suggests ( in dealing with patients with various kinds of brain damage , for example ) , by distinguishing those in minimally conscious states from those in so-called vegetative states , or in a coma . <p> While this is laudable , it 's not immediately clear that it addresses the hard problem . As Koch is well aware , a critic would naturally ask why this "" integrated information "" should feel like anything ; could n't you have the same flow of information but without consciousness ? His answer is that the axioms at the heart of IIT "" fully delimit any experience "" so that nothing is left out ; any system that obeys the axioms of IIT , he says , must be conscious . I did n't find this fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But at least it attempts to study consciousness quantitatively , which is a start . <p> And what of intelligent machines ? A computer -- at least anything that functions like today 's digital computers -- could , at best , mimic consciousness ; it would n't actually be conscious , Koch argues , because it would lack the brain 's "" intrinsic causal powers "" ; he argues that the "" brain as hardware , mind as software "" analogy has been wildly oversold . <p> And then we come to the whopper : Koch argues that everything is a little bit conscious , a view known to philosophers as panpsychism . This , in Koch 's view , gets rid of the puzzle of how consciousness emerges from non-conscious neurons ( or atoms ) ; if he 's right , consciousness was there all along . <p> As Koch is aware , panpsychism by itself leaves many questions unanswered . Why , for example , is this arrangement of matter more conscious than that arrangement of matter ? But he believes that panpsychism and IIT , taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If Koch 's book had me occasionally wearing my skeptical-emoji face , Donald D. Hoffman 's latest , The Case Against Reality , had me doing the head-exploding emoji . Hoffman , a cognitive scientist at the University of California , Irvine , starts with perception rather than consciousness , but he 's clearly hunting the same prey as Koch . The main thing he wants you to know about your perceptions is that they 're wrong -- they 're not "" veridical , "" in his preferred language . <p> It 's not that everything is an illusion ; he believes there is such a thing as "" objective reality "" -- but he says our perceptions ca n't lead us toward that reality . His argument is rooted in a combination of Darwinian natural selection and game theory known as the interface theory of perception . <p> He offers an analogy with a computer screen : We can move an icon shaped like a file folder into the "" trash , "" but we do n't really believe the two-dimensional pixel-arrays actually contain files or trash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are useful in achieving goals . Similarly , we perceive the world around us through the interface of our senses . ( This is not a brand-new idea ; Kant suggested something similar almost 250 years ago , as did Plato in his allegory of the cave some two millennia earlier . ) <p> But surely our perceptions map in a mostly true way onto the real world , right ? No , Hoffman says : He argues that Darwinian evolution would favour an organism with less-accurate perceptions over one that perceived the world as it really is . He calls this wildly counter-intuitive proposition , on which the rest of the book rests , the "" fitness-beats-truth "" ( FBT ) theorem ; he says it can be proven through computer simulations . <p> And he goes further , arguing that neither objects nor the spacetime that they appear to inhabit is real . Same goes for neurons , brains , and bodies : "" Our bodies are messages about fitness that are coded as icons in a format specific to our species , "" Hoffman writes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through time , you 're actually seeing yourself as an icon inside your own data structure . "" No wonder he frequently refers to The Matrix . "" This book offers you the red pill , "" he writes . <p> I have a number of problems with this . Let 's start with the most obvious objection : If nothing is real , why not go play on the freeway ? After all , imaginary vehicles ca n't hurt imaginary-you . Hoffman 's reply is that he takes his perceptions "" seriously "" but not "" literally . "" But this , I think , is having it both ways : If you admit that speeding cars can harm you , that 's pretty much admitting they 're real . <p> And what about spacetime ? He says that "" eminent physicists admit that space , time , and objects are not fundamental ; they 're rubbing their chins red trying to divine what might replace them . "" <p> I think he 's at most half right . Yes , many of today 's leading physicists believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? We 've known for some 200 years that matter is made of atoms ( and the ancient Greeks had guessed as much ) -- but that does n't make matter less real . It just means that , depending on the problem at hand , sometimes describing the world in terms of atoms is helpful , and sometimes it 's not . But it would be bizarre to discount cars and tables and people just because we know they 're made of smaller stuff . And if space and time turn out to be some sort of approximation to a more fundamental entity , that will be a fascinating step forward for physics -- but even that wo n't render the stuff of everyday life less real . <p> OK , so if space and time and objects are n't fundamental , what is ? Toward the end of the book , Hoffman lays out the case that conscious minds are the fundamental entities that the rest of reality is made from ; it 's minds all the way down . He calls this the "" conscious agent thesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless they 're perceived by minds . <p> This sounds a bit like Koch 's panpsychism , but Hoffman says it 's different ; he calls his philosophical outlook "" conscious realism . "" Unlike old-school panpsychism , conscious realism offers hope for a "" mathematical theory of conscious experiences , conscious agents , their networks , and their dynamics . "" From such a theory , he hopes , all of physics -- including quantum theory and general relativity -- will eventually be derived . <p> I suspect it may be a long wait . I also think it 's a bit of a stretch to imagine that physicists , having given up on space and time , are ready to subscribe to this "" minds first "" world-view . Physicist Sean Carroll , for example , has made it clear that he does n't see this as a fruitful approach . On the other hand , physicist Lee Smolin , in his most recent book , puts forward what he calls his "" causal theory of views , "" in which the universe is described in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual event ; he hopes to derive space and time and the rest of physics from these "" views . "" Maybe some lucky convergence of thought will illuminate a link between Smolin 's "" views "" and Hoffman 's "" conscious agents . "" I 'm not holding my breath , but it 's not the craziest idea out there . <p> Meanwhile , Hoffman hints at other payoffs for those who venture down the rabbit hole with him -- like a new view of God , for example . ( This did not come as a complete shock , given that one of the book 's endorsements is from Deepak Chopra . ) The research program that Hoffman envisions "" can foster what might be called a scientific theology , in which mathematically precise theories of God can be evolved , sharpened , and tested with scientific experiments . "" <p> As an alternative to the red pill , I picked up Michael S.A. Graziano 's Rethinking Consciousness . His approach is different from that of both Koch and Hoffman , and at least superficially more in line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neuroscientist at Princeton , spent much of his career developing something called the "" attention schema theory , "" which attempts to show how consciousness arises from attention -- and from the brain 's ability to keep track of what it 's attending to . Attention schema theory does n't pretend to be a solution to Chalmers ' hard problem , but "" it explains why people might mistakenly think that there is a hard problem to begin with , "" Graziano writes . <p> The idea is that the brains of certain creatures are able to model the world around them -- an ability that Graziano believes evolved around 350 million years ago . This is a purely physical phenomenon , corresponding to specific brain activity that can be fully explained ( at least in principle ) at the level of neurons and neural connections . But the brain also performs a kind of "" meta "" processing of this information , keeping tabs of what the lower levels are doing , not in detail but in broad brush-strokes . <p> As Graziano sees it , this meta-level tally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness ; it explains why looking at a red apple also "" feels like "" having such an experience . This extra layer of processing -- the attention schema -- "" seems like such a small addition , "" Graziano writes , "" and yet only then does the system have the requisite information to lay claim to a subjective experience . "" <p> There is no ghost in the machine , but attention schema theory offers an explanation for why we imagine that there is . <p> Such a system need not be biological . Unlike Koch , Graziano believes that conscious machines ought to be possible , and -- more provocatively -- that uploading of minds onto machines may one day be a reality as well . ( He figures we 'll achieve uploading before we achieve interstellar travel ; many scientists , I suspect , believe the reverse . ) <p> There 's more , of course ; Graziano spells out the many ways in which truly intelligent artificial intelligence will change our lives ( mostly for the better , he believes ) . And there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brains in particular . But the real achievement here ( assuming we buy into it ) is that it takes the wind out of Chalmers ' hard problem by reducing it to a kind of meta-problem . ( Graziano points out that Chalmers himself has considered this approach . ) <p> Attention schema theory does n't live in a vacuum ; Graziano notes that it has some elements in common with Tononi 's integrated information theory , and Dennett 's own preferred model , known as the global workspace theory . These should all be investigated in parallel , Graziano suggests , in the hope that our final theory of consciousness will draw on each of them . <p> I have no idea if or when a consensus will emerge . But it is one of the compelling scientific problems of our time , and one that demands continuing inquiry . Crick put it eloquently in the last sentence of "" The Astonishing Hypothesis , "" a quarter century ago : "" We must hammer away until we have forged a clear and valid picture not only of this vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selves .

This model is a combination of fastText and a supervised task which embeds misspellings close to their correct variants . <p> fastText is an open-source library which is designed to help build scalable solutions for text representation and classification . This library combines successful concepts like representing sentences with the bag of n-grams , using subword information and sharing information across classes through a hidden representation . <h> How It Works <p> MOE holds the fundamental properties of fastText and Word2Vec while giving explicit importance to misspelt words . This model can also be said as the generalisation of fastText where the former not only considers semantic loss but also considers an additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , spell correction loss aims to map embeddings of misspelt words close to the embeddings of their correctly spelt variants in the vector space . <h> Dataset Used <p> MOE embeddings are trained on a new misspelling dataset which is a collection of correctly spelt words along with the misspelling of those words . The total size of misspellings dataset contains more than 20 million pairs of instances and it is used to measure the spell correction loss . <h> How Is It Different <p> This model is different from other well-known word-embedding methods such as word2vec and GloVe . The current methods lack in providing embeddings for words that have not been observed during the training time -- or the Out-Of-Vocabulary ( OOV ) words . This leads to an unsatisfactory result as it allows to deal with the text which contains slangs , misspellings , etc . <h> Advantages of MOE <p> In real-world , while searching something on the web or chatting with someone , etc. humans often input text which contains misspellings . This new method will help in improving the ability to apply word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used in various domains like customer-centric enterprises to gain actionable insights from the customers ' reviews and feedbacks , chatbots , music , and video recommender systems , among others . <h> Importance of Word Embeddings Model <p> Word embeddings are like miracle drugs in resolving NLP tasks and they have eventually bettered various machine learning models . This method has been used thoroughly in machine translation , named entity resolution , automatic summarization , information retrieval , document retrieval , speech recognition , and others . At the present scenario , one of the most used forms of word embeddings is Word2Vec which is used to analyse the survey responses and gain insights from customer reviews , among others . But with the advent of MOE , there will be a huge difference in the way word embeddings used to work for NLP tasks .

It preserves the quality of the semantic analogies while improving on the syntactic analogies <h> Outlook <p> The researchers at Facebook are optimising and improving natural language processing ( NLP ) tasks by various approaches such as leveraging Google 's Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers ( BERT ) and other related approaches to push cutting-edge research in conversational AI , improve content understanding systems , and much more . <p> Recently , Facebook introduced Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach or RoBERTa which is an optimised method for pretraining natural language processing ( NLP ) systems . RoBERTa can be said as the replication project of BERT that improvise the performance of the BERT model . The model produces state-of-the-art results on the widely used NLP benchmark as well as General Language Understanding Evaluation ( GLUE ) . <h> Related Stories <h> Provide your comments below <p> A Technical Journalist who loves writing about Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence . A lover of music , writing and learning something out of the box . Contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can You Learn Machine Learning Without Linear Algebra ? <p> Machine learning is a field that has emerged out of numerous innovations in computational sciences , spanning centuries . So , can a machine learning enthusiast skip linear algebra and flourish ? The short answer is -- NO . <p> However , that 's not a complete picture . <p> Linear Algebra is a branch of mathematics that is widely used throughout science and engineering . Good understanding of linear algebra is essential for understanding and working with many ML algorithms , especially deep learning algorithms . <p> To understand this better , we are listing down the areas where an ML enthusiast will run into linear algebra in the preliminary stages of machine learning : <p> Scalars , Vectors , Tensors : Finding the modulus ( size ) , the angle between vectors ( dot or inner product ) and projections of one vector onto another and to examine how the entries describing a vector will depend on what vectors we use to define the axes <p> Matrices : Matrices can transform a description of a vector from one basis ( set of axes ) to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflection to an image and manipulate images . <p> Length squared sampling in matrices , Singular value decomposition , Low-rank approximation are few techniques which are widely used in the data processing . <p> For example , the singular value decomposition finds the best-fitting k-dimensional subspace for k= 1,2,3 , ... , for the set of N data points . Here , "" best "" means minimising the sum of the squares of the perpendicular distances of the points to the subspace , or equivalently , maximising the sum of squares of the lengths of the projections of the points onto this subspace . <p> SVD is traditionally used in the principal component analysis ( PCA ) , which in turn is popularly used for feature extraction and for knowing how significant the relationship among the features or properties is to an outcome . <p> The word ' mathematics ' brings in a ton of concepts -- and this might scare away the beginners . However , if one manages to look closely , then much of the maths used in basic ML is usually covered in high school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between points , the shorter path between points and for this , one needs linear algebra . <h> Why Reinvent The Wheel , When We Have Python Libraries <p> There is no denying the fact that building ML algorithms from scratch is a thing of the past . Modern-day programming platforms offer plenty of options where a single line of code would invoke a monstrous algorithm in the background . This works for those who want to get an idea of how ML plays out . However , if one is even remotely serious about putting an ML model into production then many issues surface . <p> For instance , a neural network is built around simple linear equations like Y = WX + B , which contain something called as weights W. These weights multiply with the input X and play a crucial in how the model predicts . The prediction scores can go downhill if a wrong weight gets updated and as the network gets deeper i.e addition of more layers ( columns of connected nodes ) , the error magnifies and the results miss the target . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already known of the presence of a system of simple equations that govern simple neural networks . With this knowledge , one can not only build the intuition of how a model performs but can also use it to compare with other models . Because , when we say a model is different , what it actually means is that equations are different . <p> One can build on this knowledge to learn about how the models optimise in the case of using gradient descent methods and how the change in learning rate signifies the performance of an algorithm . <p> via 3Blue1Brown <p> The last century has seen tremendous innovation in the field of mathematics . New theories have been postulated and traditional theorems have been made robust by persistent mathematicians . And we are still reaping the benefits of their exhaustive endeavours to build intelligent machines .

"<h> While 35 per cent Indian workers need at least 6 months of reskilling , 10 per cent need more than one year of training to meet the demands of the new workplace , the World Economic Forum report says . <p> New Delhi : The Fourth Industrial Revolution will make 75 million jobs obsolete by the year 2022 , but also create 133 million new jobs -- a net gain of 58 million , according to a new World Economic Forum ( WEF ) report titled ' The Future of Jobs 2018 ' . <p> The primary disrupters of the existing job market are emerging technologies such as robotics , artificial intelligence ( AI ) and automation . <p> The authors of the report have also warned that if the transitions to the workplace of the future are managed poorly , it would result in increased risks of widening skill gaps , greater inequality and rising polarisation . <p> For India , the WEF report predicts , 54 per cent of workers across 12 industries would need to be reskilled by 2022 .

Another estimate indicates that there will be more than 104 million fresh entrants in the labour market by 2022 . <p> Evolving technologies such as AI could complicate these estimates -- because it 's not immediately clear how many of these new entrants will have the skills to take up the newer kinds of jobs . To put it differently , we need to ask : Is India producing the right kind of workers for the jobs of tomorrow ? <p> Skilling India <p> ' Skill India ' is one of Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's pet missions .

"<h> How Self-Taught ML Expert Agnis Liukis Became A Kaggle Grandmaster <h> Read Next <p> "" I 've exchanged most of my evenings of watching TV for evenings of competing on Kaggle . "" <p> Agnis Liukis <p> For this week 's ML practitioner 's series , Analytics India Magazine got in touch with Agnis Liukis from Latvia , who is a Kaggle Grandmaster ranked 14th in the global leaderboard . He shares his insightful journey , tips and tricks in this interview . <h> How It All Began <p> Despite featuring in top 10 of the highly competitive Kaggle contests , Agnis , surprisingly , is neither a data scientist nor a machine learning engineer . He currently works as a Lead Software Architect in TietoEVRY , Latvia where his main focus is on developing web solutions for the backend and frontend . His foray into machine learning is a combination of keeping up with trends and his love for programming and mathematics . <p> He has a Master 's degree in Information Technology , and all his Kaggle accomplishments are the direct result of his zeal to know more . Agnis is self-taught , and his journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a career was getting more attention globally . Agnis found this domain to have a promising future and started taking online courses . He started with the course from Andrew Ng , which he also recommends to beginners . <p> However , he soon realised that theory would only take him so far . He wanted to get hands-on experience of dealing with machine learning models . His search for high-quality machine learning challenges landed him in the coveted Kaggle community . <p> "" At the beginning , there 's a lot of information to learn . One must learn theory to understand different algorithms , their weak and strong sides , and when to use which of them . They must also know things like what 's overfitting and how to deal with it . And many more things . And in parallel , there 's a lot of tools and frameworks available -- they will have to be learned as well , "" says Agnis , remembering his initial days . <p> Though he was n't new to Python , it took him some time to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be successful in competitions , like LightGBM , XgBoost , Scikit-learn , Matplotlib etc . Today , after having participated in more than 100 competitions on Kaggle , Agnis has eight gold medals and is currently ranked 14th out of 1,39,500 participants . <h> Kaggle Journey <p> "" One does n't have to be an expert to start competing . In my first competition on Kaggle , I got a silver medal based on my knowledge in Math and Probabilities . "" <p> Agnis says that the yearning for competition comes to him naturally . Be it sports or computer games , he likes to compete . "" So it was quite natural for me to enter the world of Competitive Data Science once I decided to learn Data Science , "" says Agnis . <p> When it comes to approaching a problem on Kaggle , Agnis says that he would first read and try to understand the underlying problem , the data and its purpose . When it comes to data exploration , he underlines the importance of looking at raw data , which is essential , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching data from "" heights "" -- looking at some general statistics , distributions , trends and so on . But sometimes , key insights are hidden in raw data values . "" <p> "" For example , some competitions have a special pattern of digits after comma -- like many values ending with .33333 , .66666 and so on , which give some clues about how this data was obtained and how to use that information to improve the score . And things like this ca n't be seen from general statistics , but only from raw data , "" explained Agnis . <p> When some working pipeline is ready , he would usually make some initial submissions to calibrate the cross-validation , which he considers to be an essential strategy as it helps in better generalisation and allows to avoid overfitting on the public leaderboard . He reveals that falling during shake-up when a private leaderboard is revealed is one of the most threatening things all competitors are afraid of . Hence , good cross-validation is a key factor in avoiding this . <p> Achieving the top spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the importance of taking out some time to learn things , to explore data , to write code for models , do experiments , read and explore ideas in a competition forum . Time is a significant differentiator , and he laments about lacking the same right now as he has a full-time job and a family . "" Basically I 've exchanged most of my evenings of ' watching TV ' for evenings of ' competing on Kaggle ' . That 's more fun and also more useful , "" quipped Agnis . <p> Agnis looks at Kaggle as a great way to stay up-to-date with all bleeding-edge technologies and approaches in Data Science and Machine Learning . <h> Tips , Tricks And Tools <p> For competitions , Agnis typically works with his home computer ( 16 GB RAM ) , which he considers to be enough for most of the problems , or at least for tabular data and NLP . For computationally intensive contests , he prefers to create a virtual machine on Google Cloud Platform with desired power . <p> However , he reminds us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition "" format , requiring submissions to be made through Kaggle kernels , and he often uses resources offered by Kaggle , which is about the same power as his home computer , but with an advantage of launching multiple kernels in parallel . <p> "" Fail fast when testing new ideas . If an idea is not working , simply forget about it and try something new . "" <p> To avoid getting caught up in non-working ideas for weeks and wasting a lot of time , Agnis recommends the participants to move on to the next idea as soon as possible . That said , Agnis does admit to giving his failed ideas one final shot before scrapping them just in case there are any bugs . <p> When it comes to libraries , Agnis expresses his fondness for LightGBM , mainly due to its speed and low memory requirements . LightGBM is also his primary option for all tabular data problems . For neural networks , he prefers the popular Keras library . For the rest of Data Science tasks in Python , he finds Pandas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Talking about how smart one needs to be to go from good to great , Agnis took the example of one of the competitions , which he has won by teaming up with Evgeny Patekha . The competition titled ' Sberbank Russian Housing Market ' deals with predicting house prices in Moscow . Agnis recollected how hard the dataset was and how difficult it was to get stable cross-validation due to the small size of data and many significant outliers . <p> The summary of his thought process that fetched him gold : <p> there were two significantly different types of products there , and critical factor was to notice that and train separate models for each type ; <p> only one of those product types contained outliers , therefore , using only the other type for CV worked well ; <p> The strongest feature when predicting price there was the full area of the house , but it contained a lot of errors in data ( like typos , unrealistic values , etc . ) . So , remove the most powerful feature and include it in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Triumphs <p> When asked whether the hype around machine learning is real , Agnis stayed loyal to his opinion from the initial days about how promising data science would be . He opined that machine learning is here to stay and its importance will only grow in the coming years as we collect more data , leverage more computer power , tweak algorithms and make them affordable . <p> He also speculates that there will be tremendous opportunities for the AutoML field as many companies can not afford hiring good data scientists for building models from scratch . However , he also warns us that many people think machine learning to be some kind of super algorithm which can solve problems perfectly . For instance , he explains , using computer vision for medicine can not be taken to be 100% perfect as the impact of failure can be huge . But , an ML model can assist a doctor in assessing results more confidently . <p> "" ML helps only if it is used in a smart way ; understanding what it can do and what it ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting hands-on with real ML tasks or competitions as soon as possible because courses and theories may seem clear and straightforward . But , when one is tasked with 1 million rows of raw data , the real training begins ! <p> For the participants who are looking to top the Kaggle leaderboards , Agnis advises that using good models just wo n't win the competitions . "" To stand out and get some real advantage , it is necessary to do something different , find something that others did n't notice . And creativity is something that really helps in this . Another thing is patience and endurance , as most creative ideas wo n't work and it can take many iterations and experiments to get things working , "" concluded Agnis."
"<p> Imagine you are sipping coffee at a cafe during your break , and your smartphone pings to remind you that the holidays are around the corner -- it 's time to plan a getaway . A touch reveals a list of likely locations prepared by your personal digital advisor ( aka your smartphone ) based on your preferences , past travels , and your recent searches . You shortlist a few and the search engine prompts you to take a virtual tour after generating a QR ( quick response ) code to be scanned at any kiosk to take a virtual tour of the destination attractions and connect with your wearable devices . You conference with your friend and tour a scenic location together online . <p> The virtual tour replicates not just the sights , but also the sounds and smells one might experience . The final location is decided and you pick flights , hotels , and excursions using virtual/augmented tours . You link your biometric data to be used at the time of customs , hotels and airline check-in . Finally use your crypto account to make payment partly using points , coins and cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's done ! And it 's time to head back to office . <p> You just visited three continents , explored four or five cities together , all during a coffee break . That was fast , efficient , exciting , and immersive , was n't it ? <p> This traveller of the future will be much more tech-savvy , driven by experiences and a focus on value-for-money , and will interact differently with the world . Research has shown that millennials and Generation Z , who comprise about 60% of the global population , are more likely to pick a travel destination and stays based on their social media feed than relying on a paid advertisement . <p> The emergence and acceptance of the sharing economy , with companies like Airbnb , OyoRooms and BlaBlaCar , has struck a chord with enterprising and cost-conscious travellers . It has also created completely new dynamics on the supply side by helping monetization of personal assets and bringing unorganized budget hotels or lodges in the mainstream . <p> SEAMLESS EXPERIENCES <p> The journey of a traveller from search to discovery to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or her need of a seamless experience , adventure , personalization , instant gratification , and reliance on peer-to-peer feedback . <p> These travellers are growing . According to a report by World Tourism Organization , it is estimated that by 2030 , people will take 1.8 billion international trips . In 2017 , India generated about 24 million outbound trips , both business and leisure , which is going to increase significantly going forward . While this is the change we will witness in future , the disruptions are already underway . <p> Augmented reality is being used currently for language translation by pointing smartphone cameras at words , navigation , and routing . An example is the interactive metro maps for the New York subway . <p> Virtual reality is bringing destinations and accommodation closer to the traveller , allowing travellers to explore destinations that he or she can select and experience before making the booking . Some of these firms go as far as to use wind machines and olfactory stimulants to replicate not just the sights but also the smells and sounds . <p> Internet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process -- in the form of voice-enabled hotel search in Alexa through Kayak and reservation via booking.com , keyless digital entry in hotels , baggage tracking and notification , and seamless integration of your own devices with the inter-connected devices in hotel rooms . <p> Artificial intelligence-driven engines are learning more about consumer behaviour -- the more the AI engine knows about you , the better recommendation it will be able to provide along with customized emotional or economic benefits from the providers . Mobility startup Mobacar , for instance , uses machine learning to predict the mode of transport and type of vehicle a traveller may want and pushes only relevant offers , while travel assistant Mezi uses natural language processing to provide a personalized experience to business travellers who usually are short of time . <p> Biometrics can help simplify the journey and may replace the identity documents , maybe even passports , through fingerprint , facial or iris recognition at customs , hotels and airline check-ins . <p> Robotics is being used in automating monotonous tasks . Customer service robots already exist at Munich , Bologna and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , deployed at Frankfurt Airport , answers questions about the gate for airline departures , can direct passengers to specific restaurants and help them access the airport 's free Wi-Fi . In Sasebo , Japan , a hotel is run almost entirely by robots enabling check-in at reception and luggage transfer to rooms . <p> Blockchain is also seen as a future disruptor of the entire travel value chain through increased disintermediation and democratization . It has the potential to remove intermediaries and balance the bargaining power in the hands of online travel agencies ( OTAs ) , and inventory owners . For instance , Winding Tree is a decentralized travel distribution platform for inventory tracking and Travala is a travel booking marketplace that ledgerizes and decentralizes the hotel industry , allowing users to add rooms backed by smart contracts . <p> These new age technologies will also have implications related to customer data , usage , storage and accessibility and are bound to give rise to data and privacy regulations . <p> THE NEW AGE CUSTOMER <p> While the customer is evolving and being pampered by the choices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rise of other inventory providers like online travel aggregators , metasearch agencies and digital tour guides will also ensure that the business model on the supply side shifts . Today hotels and other inventory owners have less bargaining power at the hands of large online travel agencies ( OTAs ) but are coping as the cost of customer acquisition has reduced .

"<h> U.S. Enters Exascale Race <p> 20 March 2019 <p> Rick Merritt <p> Race to build the worlds first exascale systems heats up as U.S. Department of Energy awards Intel and Cray a contract to build 3 exascale-class supercomputers . <p> SAN JOSE , Calif. -- The U.S. Department of Energy awarded Intel and Cray a contract for more than $500 million to build the first of three exascale-class supercomputers . Intel said that the system will be running before the end of 2021 using future Xeon processors , Optane DIMMs , and a so-called Xe product , believed to be a member of the GPU family in design under Raja Koduri . <p> The DoE plans to spend a total of $1.8 billion on the three systems . It is expected to soon announce that the team of IBM and Nvidia will build the two other systems using their future power processors and GPUs . <p> The Intel/Cray system , called Aurora , will be built at the Argonne National Lab using more than 200 Cray cabinets and likely be the first of the three in service . The IBM/Nvidia systems would be follow-ons to Summit and Sierra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world at 143 and 94 petaflops , respectively . <p> The DoE 's other two exascale systems , called Frontier and El Capitan , will be built at the Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore Labs , respectively , where the Summit and Sierra systems currently run . All of the U.S. systems are expected to deliver a peak performance of up to 1.3 exaflops , using up to 8 petabytes of memory and consuming about 40 MW . <p> Representatives of Intel and Argonne declined to reveal the size , power consumption , and architecture of Aurora or details of the Xe accelerator . The system will use the Slingshot fabric in Cray 's Shasta systems and run a combination of systems software from Cray and a set of yet-to-be defined programming libraries that Intel calls OneAPI . <p> The 2021 target could mean a fairly tight design cycle for the new Intel GPU in the works , said veteran graphics analyst Jon Peddie . Alternatively , the Aurora accelerator might be an FPGA or multicore x86 part replacing the discontinued Xeon Phi or a hybrid . Intel could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ship later this year in versions for AI training and inference . <p> Worldwide , at least eight major exascale systems are in the works , including the three U.S. efforts . Three projects are competing in China to launch as early as 2020 , although experts believe that they may not get up and running until 2021 . <p> "" It might be a nail biter "" to see who gets bragging rights of having the first exascale system , said Jack Dongarra , a co-author of the Top 500 supercomputer list and a professor at the University of Tennessee . <p> A supercomputer roadmap for U.S. national labs . <p> A quick survey of exascale efforts around the globe <p> One exascale project in China is a follow-on of the Sunway TaihuLight in Wuxi , currently the world 's third most powerful system . It uses a whopping 10.6 million proprietary cores to deliver 93 petaflops . <p> The second China effort is a follow-on to the Tianhe-2A in Guangzhou currently using Xeon CPUs and Matrix-2000 accelerators designed by China 's National University of Defense Technology . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's third exascale effort is a new project led by server maker Sugon with x86 chips believed to be derived from AMD 's Zen core as part of a 2016 joint venture . <p> Elsewhere , researchers in Europe and Japan have separate exascale efforts , both based on Arm cores . Fujitsu is building the Post-K system and Bull is leading the European effort . <p> All of the systems aim to handle a mix of traditional high-performance computing jobs such as complex simulations as well as emerging workloads based on deep learning and other analytics algorithms . As such , the new systems will be important in proving grounds for accelerator technologies already popular in the Top 500 . <p> So far , Intel listed only generic ingredients for Aurora . <p> Nvidia GPUs are , by far , the most popular accelerators in the Top 500 systems , distantly followed by Intel 's Xeon Phi , now being replaced presumably by its next-generation GPU . Intel dominates in CPUs , appearing in more than 95% of the systems . <p> The systems are typically measured using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use lower-precision math , meaning that these tasks could effectively see performance in the range of multiple exaflops on the new systems , said Dongarra . <p> Exascale systems are also expected to break new ground in optical networks and interconnects . For example , Intel said that it plans to use silicon photonics in the Aurora system . <p> "" In general , the new systems will create another wave of acceleration across many areas of science , technology , and health care , "" said Rick Stevens , an associate lab director at Argonne , announcing the Intel/Cray deal . <p> Aurora will handle a broad range of jobs for DoE and academic researchers . They include materials research in batteries and photovoltaics , earthquake and climate forecasting , and optimizing efficiency of wind turbines , as well as studying cancer and traumatic brain injuries in veterans ."

"<h> The Real Reason Why America Is Inviting Public Comments On AI Patents <p> In its history of over 200 years , the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) has granted over 10 million domestic patents . Now it seems that America 's highest authority on patents is a little cautious about understanding artificial intelligence in detail to help grant AI-based patents . This seems to be the case , as USPTO has invited public comments on various patent-related issues . <p> USPTO said that it is for evaluating whether further examination guidance is required for encouraging the reliability and predictability of patenting AI inventions . UPSTO has already published 12 questions relating to several AI patent issues , covering a diverse set of subjects ranging from patent examination policy to whether novel types of IP protection laws are required . <p> Here are the 12 questions that USPTO is seeking public comments on : <p> What are the elements of an AI invention ? <p> What are the different ways that a natural person can contribute to the conception of an AI invention and be eligible to be a named inventor ? <p> Do current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take into account inventions where an entity or entities other than a natural person contributed to the conception of an invention ? <p> Should an entity or entities other than a natural person , or company to which a natural person assigns an invention , be able to own a patent on the AI invention ? <p> Are there any patent eligibility considerations unique to AI inventions ? <p> Are there any disclosure-related considerations unique to AI inventions ? <p> How can patent applications for AI inventions best comply with the enablement requirement , particularly given the degree of unpredictability of certain AI systems ? <p> Does AI impact the level of a person of ordinary skill in the art ? If so , how ? For example : Should an assessment of the level of ordinary skill in the art reflect the capability possessed by AI ? <p> Are there any prior art considerations unique to AI inventions ? <p> Are there any new forms of intellectual property protections that are needed for AI inventions , such as data protection ? <p> Are there any other issues pertinent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are there any relevant policies or practices from other major patent agencies that may help inform USPTO 's policies and practices regarding patenting of AI inventions ? <h> Ensuring The Reliability Of Future AI Patents <p> The reason why USPTO is looking to gather public information on AI patents is because of the varying levels of potential uncertainties in such patent filings . AI methods and systems can differ in their technical implementations and also rely on a large amount of training by developers , inventors and system users , according to USPTO . The agency reported that it has been looking into AI and related inventions for decades now and although it has already issued several guidelines in this regard , it is reevaluating those to ensure the reliability of future patents . USPTO has reported it seeks more engagement with the technology community and AI experts to continue working on future guidelines related to granting AI patents on the inventions . <p> "" With respect to AI inventions to date , the USPTO has issued thousands of patents on AI technologies , and the future grows more exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with excitement comes change , and the potential for uncertainty . Therefore , the USPTO must continue to ensure an appropriate balance in the administration of our IP system , "" said Laura Peter , Deputy Director of the USPTO . <p> There are multiple complexities that may arise that make granting patents on artificial intelligence challenging . For example , as per the prevalent patent seeking guidelines of USPTO , applicants of AI inventions are required to present a written description along with a sufficient disclosure of the algorithm that performs a perform a claimed function . This is done so it can be reasonably concluded that the inventor had possession of the claimed invention . USPTO asks whether there needs to be a change in the level of detail an applicant must provide in order to comply with the written description requirement , particularly for deep-learning systems that can have a large number of hidden layers with weights that evolve without human intervention during the learning/training process . <h> Overview <p> At a time when AI inventions are taking the world by storm , USPTO 's stance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This will help in increasing the reliability and predictability of future patents in the US and for other countries to learn from . Apart from patents , USPTO is also looking to examine the full spectrum of intellectual property policy issues that have arisen due to advancements in artificial intelligence technologies . This includes economic frameworks created as a result of AI innovation , patents , trade secrets , trademarks and copyright issues . This will help with any lack of legal clarity on inventions , laws and policies related to AI . <p> Vishal Chawla is a senior technology journalist at Analytics India Magazine , and writes on the latest trends in the world of analytics , AI and other digital technologies .

"<p> A slew of emerging technologies is shaping our lives , arguably at a rate of change never seen before in history . Enabled by cheap computing power and access to large data sets , machines are already doing a better job than humans in several areas . <p> This ' intelligence ' is moving away from central server farms into devices and things that will soon become part of our daily lives . These devices will potentially negotiate their own way in our world via ' smart contracts ' and without significant human intervention . <p> While there is significant ground to cover , India is promisingly poised to take advantage of this gathering storm of opportunity . As these technologies move out of the research labs and innovation hubs in Silicon Valley towards real-world implementation , India offers an opportunity to implement at a scale that is probably matched only by China , according to an exclusive EY-Mint Emerging Technologies Report that was released during the Mint Digital Innovation Summit on 15 March in Bengaluru . <p> As India goes digital , data sets about various facets of Indian consumers and businesses are becoming available to fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headfirst into the race to apply these technologies and data sets to solve unique Indian problems including agriculture , urban transport , energy management , financial inclusion , small format retail to name only a few . <p> Last , but not the least , the government is taking several steps to spur the adoption of emerging technologies . <p> However , there is a lot more to be done . To be able to compete with the US and China , India will need to invest significantly more to create a conducive environment to foster innovation and attract talent , as this report indicates . The dialogue is not just about survival , but the willingness to fight and thrive to stay ahead of the curve . The question is : Are you ready ? <h> Key emerging technologies : AI <p> It is catalysing transformation in every industry -- helping companies transform the customer experience , launch digital products and services , and optimize supply chains .

It helps to choose preferred model complexity , so that model is better at predicting . <p> L1 regularisation is also coined as L1 norm or Lasso . Basically , in the L1 norm , the parameters are shrunk to zero . This regularisation does the feature selection by assigning insignificant input features with zero weight and useful features with non-zero weight . <p> On the other hand , L2 regularisation or Ridge regularisation spreads the error among all the features . This regularization forces the weights to be small but does not make them zero and does non-sparse solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the error differences of the outliers and the regularization term tries to fix it by penalizing the weights . Ridge regression performs better when all the input features influence the output and all with weights are of roughly equal size . <h> 2 How Data Science differs from Big Data and Data Analytics ? <p> Data Science is a field which contains various tools and algorithms for gaining useful insights from raw data . It involves various methods for data modelling and other data related tasks such as data cleansing , preprocessing , analysis , etc . Big Data implies the enormous amount of data which can be structured , unstructured and semi-structured generated through various channels and organisations . The tasks of Data Analytics involve providing operational insights into complex business situations . This also predicts the upcoming opportunities which the organisation can exploit . <h> 3 How do Data Scientists use statistics ? <p> Statistics plays a powerful role in Data Science . It is one of the most important disciplines to provide tools and methods to find structure in and to give deeper insight into data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploration , analysis , validation , etc. <h> 4 Why data cleansing is important ? <p> Data cleansing is a process in which you go through all of the data within a database and either remove or update information that is incomplete , incorrect , improperly formatted , duplicated , or irrelevant . It usually involves cleaning up data compiled in one area . For individuals , data cleansing is important because it ensures Data cleansing usually involves cleaning up data compiled in one area . In the case of an organisation , data cleansing is important because it improves your data quality and in doing so , increases overall productivity . <h> 5 What is Linear and Logistic Regression ? <p> The linear regression method involves continuous dependent variable and contains only one independent variable in case of Simple Linear Regression and multiple independent variables in case of Multiple Linear Regression . Here , the outcome ( dependent variable ) is continuous and can have any one of an infinite number of possible values . Linear regression gives an equation which is of the form Y = mX + @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is used when your response variable is continuous . For instance , weight , height , number of hours , etc . <p> While in logistic regression , the outcome ( dependent variable ) has only a limited number of possible values . Logistic regression is used when the response variable is categorical in nature . For instance , yes/no , true/false , red/green/blue , etc . This method gives an equation which is of the form Y = eX+ e-X. <h> 6 What is Normal Distribution ? <p> The Normal Distribution is a very common distribution and in the statistical term , it is known as Gaussian distribution . A normal distribution has the following characteristics such as the mean , median and mode of the distribution coincide , the curve of the distribution is bell-shaped and symmetrical about the line x= ? , the total area under the curve is 1 and exactly half of the values are to the left of the center and the other half to the right . <h> 7 Difference between Interpolation and Extrapolation <p> Extrapolation and interpolation are both used to estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interpolation is an estimation of a value within two known values in a sequence of values and Extrapolation is an estimation of a value based on extending a known sequence of values or facts beyond the area that is certainly known . <h> 8 What is a recommender system ? <p> Recommender systems are one of the most widely spread applications of machine learning technologies in organisations . This system helps a user to interact with many items . The machine learning algorithms in recommender systems are typically classified into two categories ? -- content-based and collaborative filtering methods although modern recommenders combine both approaches . Content-based methods are based on the similarity of item attributes and collaborative methods calculate similarity from interactions . <h> 9 Between R and Python , Which one would you choose for text analysis ? <p> Between R and Python , Python would be the best choice as it has Pandas library which provides high-performance data analysis tools and easy to use data structures . However , you can go with either of these languages depending on the complexity of the data which is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a statistical method of comparing two or more versions in order to determine which version works better and also understands if the difference between the two or more versions is statistically significant . It is a powerful tool for product development . In technical terms , A/B test is used to refer to any number of experiments where random assignment is used to tease out a causal relationship between treatment , typically some change to a website , and an outcome , often a metric that the business is interested in changing . <h> Related Stories <h> Provide your comments below <p> A Technical Journalist who loves to take everything creatively .

( Photo : ANI ) <p> New Delhi : Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said that India is walking towards an era of ' women-led development ' . <p> Addressing the nation through his monthly radio program , Mann ki Baat , Prime Minister Modi said India is heading towards women-led development from only women development . <p> "" India is heading towards women-led development from only women development . We are discussing development under the leadership of women , "" he said . <p> He then went on to talk about the role that artificial intelligence and technology can play in ensuring the welfare of the poor and underprivileged . <p> "" I urge the scientists to find ways in which we can enhance lives of our ' divyang ' brothers &amp; sisters through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and technology are value-neutral , "" the Prime Minister said , "" It depends on us what work we want a machine to do . Hence , human objectivity becomes important . "" <p> Modi then went on to laud the spirit of inquiry , saying one must not rest till "" one gets the answer to all the questions . "" <p> Modi also thanked the forces that reach out for rescue operations immediately after disasters happen . <p> "" We have many unnamed , unsung heroes in the Fire and Rescue services , National Disaster Response Forces , Armed Forces and in the Paramilitary forces who bravely reach out during emergencies without caring about their lives , "" said Modi . <p> He also appreciated organisations like NCC and Scouts who also help during such situations . <p> The Prime Minister went on to say that apart from purely natural disasters , most calamities occur because people are not vigilant enough and do not follow the rules . <p> "" We must become a risk-conscious society , understand values of safety . In our culture , we often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to understand values of safety . We must make it a part of our lives , "" he said . <p> The Prime Minister also stressed the importance of biodegradable wastes , announcing the "" GOBAR dhan "" ( Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources ) initiative under the Swachh Bharat Mission , which will encourage the use of dung , farm waste , kitchen waste for biogas energy . <p> "" New jobs would be created through #waste collection and transportation . Online trading platform would be set up to run ' Gobar Dhan Yojana ' smoothly ; it will connect farmers to buyers , "" said Modi . <p> He lauded the Trash Mahotsav that recently took place in Chattisgarh . <p> The objective behind it was to utilise waste creatively &amp; to spread awareness about ways to reuse garbage . <p> Modi also congratulated people of Elephanta Islands as three villages get electricity for the first time after spending 70 years in darkness , saying it was in a new phase of development ."
"<h> Tips To Ace Your First Machine Learning Hackathon <h> Read Next <p> Imagine a sprint-like event , where anybody , right from the industry 's who 's who to a novice college graduate working in collaboration with their respective teams to create a functioning solution for the problem at hand . <p> Hackathons are truly such electric events that form the breeding ground for such brilliant tech solutions . It also sometimes prove to be a great way to hire professionals who have the perfect mix of data science knowledge and programming skills for companies working in the areas of machine learning , artificial intelligence , and data science . <p> The popularity of hackathons has only grown over the years . As per a survey , 32% of respondents said that hackathons are an excellent medium for learning and upskilling . Interestingly , only 6% think that the prize money is the most attractive part of a hackathon ; we can safely deduce that merely participating in a hackathon as an experience is unmatched . <p> For this article , we will be centring our discussion around machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are more defined than the general coding or product-focused hackathons ; the focus is more towards building a tangible product or discovery for the greater good rather than just bagging that prize money . <p> So what if you are a machine learning enthusiast and want to kick-off your hackathon journey ? Here we give you step-by-step instructions on how to start : <h> Choosing the Base Tool <p> Choosing the correct tool or programming language before entering a hackathon is the most basic and yet crucial step . One can choose from a slew of options available -- R , Python , SAS , and Spark . For people who are new to machine learning and data science , in general , are often advised to opt for ' safe ' Python as it is easier to learn and comes in handy with the larger ecosystem . <p> However , all said , the focus should be on problem-solving rather than spending too much time on learning an entirely new language . <h> Preparing Roadmap <p> A little spadework before actually participating in a hackathon would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could begin by attending a few workshops , undertaking a course or practising a few easy-to-do projects . You can choose among various resources available on the internet -- MachineHack , Kaggle , and HackerEarth . Going through the common machine learning algorithms such as linear regression , logical regression , K-means , decision trees , and the random forest is also advised . Devising your own tips and tricks from the past competition-specific hackathons is sure to give an edge . <h> Building the Right Team <p> Having the right team to work and collaborate with is half the battle won . It is definitely not a standalone effort , and every participant should have complementary skill sets , meaning being a developer is not enough , you would still need people who are good with graphics , the business side of the project , backend developer , and subject matter experts . It is beneficial to form your group before entering the competition . One could do that by networking over social network platforms to get information about other participants . <p> Once you are set on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could then be broken down into smaller chunks , and each teammate can be delegated the task corresponding to their area of expertise . <h> Other Important Tips and Tricks <p> Set realistic goals . Be honest with what you can achieve with your present skill set . <p> Build a prototype that works and is demonstrable . <p> Work on presentation skills . No matter how hard you work on your project , it ultimately boils down to how you present it . <p> Do your homework and be thorough with your research . Be absolutely sure of the APIs and the libraries to be used . <p> Prepare libraries of reusable code . This will save a lot of time . Alternatively , one could also prepare a standard set of code/functions to be used in most , if not all , of the hackathons . <p> Dive in with a mindset of problem-solving and possible real-life applications . This gives a larger perspective to approach the project . <p> Pay attention to building a hypothesis and workflow for better organisation . <p> There are 24- , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take adequate breaks in between to avoid burnout . <p> Lastly , have fun !

"<h> "" Our homes are being ' Alexa-fied ' , ' Google-fied ' , ' Siri-fied ' "" <p> An interview with Jyoti Kumar Bansal , CEO , PHD India . This is a part of the special series of conversations with media agency heads - interview 2 of 31 . <p> What , in your view , was your agency 's best campaign of 2019 ? What about it impressed you ? <p> There are many , from ' Skobot ' ( AI powered chat bot for Skoda ) to ' Chasing the Sun - Dong Valley ' for Volkswagen , to the deep data-driven marketing work for HP . My personal favourite was conceived in 2019 but will come to life in this year -- watch out for it . <p> In 2020 , what is that big trend that ought to concern or excite media agencies ? <p> If the last couple of years have been about video , the next big wave is voice -- be it in a new smartphone , gadget or in an AI-enabled avatar . PHD 's book Sentience had projected that voice-enabled assistants will permeate our lives in multiple ways by 2020 . And today , our homes are being **32;736;TOOLONG . Just as Millennials and Gen-Z ca n't imagine a world without mobile phones , people born in this decade wo n't understand a world without voice-commanded devices . <p> My seven-year-old daughter thinks nothing of talking to the search bar in her tablet to find the video she wants to watch , or telling Alexa to play a song she wants to dance to , or discovering that she can listen to bedtime stories at her command , or telling Miko to help out with her homework . A whole generation is growing up talking to machines and gadgets as naturally and comfortably as they talk to human beings . So the questions for marketers are : How will my brand talk to consumers ? Am I ready to leverage this ? <p> In the context of media planning/buying , what 's the one global practice/trend India will do well to catch up with fast ? <p> The collision of OTT , CTV ( connected TV ) and linear TV is creating a new world of planning , buying and selling . The opportunities and challenges that come with this are exciting . Addressability and precision marketing are going to challenge us to create new ways of defining and reaching people . This new world will belong to brave advertisers who do n't get stuck in TV rating-based transactions and metrics . <p> From a media spend perspective , which product groups do you suppose will be most affected by the economic slowdown that has crept up on us - and least ? <p> Products that people can defer purchasing , or reduce their consumption of , will be affected much more than those that are ' immediate ' and utilitarian . As technology changes the way people eat , shop , browse and consume content , product groups that enable these behaviours will see an upsurge in spending . Segments like education , online shopping , and content consumption have been on a growth trajectory , and are upending categories that have traditionally been high spenders . <p> And within that , what consumption trends are you seeing in rural versus urban markets ? <p> The mobile screen is narrowing the gap between urban and rural markets ; intent and desire are similar across the two , and are constrained only by the availability of disposable income . Across brands , while urban and higher income audience segments continue to hold strong , growth trends are coming from farther out . Technology is allowing companies to reach wider audiences faster . As e-commerce players enable rural Indians to buy the same product at the same price as their counterparts in large towns , the democratisation of consumption will soon be a reality . <p> In the next 12 months , the solution to the digital ad fraud menace will come from ... <p> A mix of technology and human vigilance . Technology will provide the tools . At the human level , having a deeper understanding of this technology will allow us to take quick action , and put the cost associated with deploying such technology into perspective . <p> What kind of specialisation/talent is missing in media agencies today ? <p> Truly creative digital talent is definitely missing in media agencies . Also missing are creative technologists and people who can unleash the power of AI and machine learning for agencies and advertisers . We also need to upgrade investment teams and bring in a mix of Spock and Captain Kirk -- immensely logical , yet focused on humans ... in a data-driven world it is easy to lose sight of the humans who generate all that data in the first place . <p> Note : This interview was conducted for the mid-March edition of our magazine afaqs ! Reporter . It is a special issue dedicated to the top media planning and buying executives , who service some of India 's largest advertisers . Market conditions have changed dramatically since this interview was first written and any apparent obsoletion therein must be seen in that context .

"<h> Read Next <p> Amazon has been introducing many useful tools to make machine learning easier for developers around the world . Continuing this trend of making machine learning more accessible and comfortable , Amazon 's AWS launched a brand new approach in adding machine learning predictions to developer 's products and processes by directly integrating those predictions with their database . <h> Problems with Adding Models <p> It wo n't be long until all applications have machine learning and artificial intelligence used inside them . It can be challenging to incorporate the machine learning models into your databases , analytics and business intelligence reports . For example , for a simple bad review which states that someone does n't like the product , the production company ca n't run sentiment analysis and get back at the reviewer to make things right . The data is available in their database , and there are ML services for that . Building the prediction pipelines to move data between models and applications is the problematic part . <p> Traditionally , developers have had to perform manual work to take these predictions to make them part of a more extensive application , process or analysis and this manual work is large and complicated . These complications include tedious application-level code development to copy data between different data stores and locations then transform data between formats before submitting data to the ML models and then get the results in your applications . This work is time-consuming and moving data in and out of data stores complicates governance and security . <h> How Amazon is Making Machine Learning More Accessible <p> AWS has a new approach to easily add machine learning to machine learning predictions with applications and business intelligence dashboards . AWS allows developers to combine tools like Amazon QuickSight , Aurora and Athena with SQL queries . These make it easier to add ML predictions without the need to build custom integrations , learn separate tools , write complex code , move data , and one can do it without any experience in machine learning . Developers can now access more variety of data than they already could without additional coding making the development process fast and more manageable . <p> Amazon 's Aurora is a MySQL compatible database that automatically takes data into the application to run a machine learning model assigned by a developer . Next , the developers can obtain additional datasets more easily from the company 's serverless system , Athena . The final step is QuickAight , which is Amazon 's data visualisation tool . The combination of these three tools provides a far more efficient approach to the development of the machine learning models . <p> For example , the lead scoring model in sales is where you pick the most likely targets to convert to sales . Using machine learning prediction you do n't have to write any additional code , that would adapt to different codes incompatible with each other aka the ' glue code ' . You just have to take the lead scoring model built by the data science team then deploy it to SageMaker and order all sales queues by priority based on a prediction from the model . Wood says , "" Today , to do lead scoring you have to go off and wire up all these pieces together to be able to get the predictions into the application . "" With this new capability , you can get there much faster . <p> Explaining further , "" Now , as a developer , I can just say that I have this lead scoring model which is deployed in SageMaker , and all I have to do is write literally one SQL statement that I do all day long into Aurora , and I can start getting back that lead scoring information . And then I just display it in my application and away I go , "" <h> Advantages of this approach <p> As pointed out by Amazon , this process makes the machine learning simple and more accessible to the developers all around the world . With broader access to a large number of datasets , the development part has become much faster , and no additional code sequences need to be called . Anyone who can know how to write SQL can use machine learning predictions in their applications without custom code and can focus on other parts of the process with more efficiency . <p> On the business intelligence front , a lot of Amazon customers fuss how it 's frustrating to build and manage prediction pipelines before getting predictions from a model . On average , these developers spend days writing application code to move data between models and applications ; Amazon QuickSight can be used instead to visualise and report all ML predictions . <h> Enjoyed this story ?

"<h> Economic conclave : Data is the New Oil <p> The title of this column is the title of a presentation made by Nandan Nilekani at the Delhi Economics Conclave last week . The conclave is an annual conference hosted by the Ministry of Finance , and brings together economists , academics , policy makers , researchers and regulators . It 's a tradition started by the Ministry in recent years , and the sessions are packed with topical ideas , discussions and debates . Two years ago , the conclave was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi . This year the keynote speeches were given by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley , and by Tharman Shanmugaratnam , the Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore . One of the theme this year , was on the future of cash , anchored around an insightful presentation by Professor Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard , who is the author of "" The Curse of Cash "" . Naturally India 's demonetisation loomed large in the ensuing discussion . <p> But it was Nilekani 's presentation that absolutely enthralled the audience . He is best known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aadhaar . He is also the author of the 2009 book "" Imagining India : The Idea of a Renewed Nation "" and more recently co-authored "" Rebooting India : Realising a Billion Aspirations "" . The idea captured in his rather provocative title has been evident in his writings for quite some time . Recently , Nilekani gave a similar talk in his convocation address at IIT Madras . The launch of Reliance Jio 's inexpensive smartphone for a billion people the same week was perhaps an ordained coincidence ! The Economist magazine of London , too , had a recent cover story hinting at "" data as the new oil "" . Nilekani repeated many times that India is on the verge of a digital revolution and will go swiftly from being a data-poor to a data-rich country . That data represents immense business opportunities . <p> The modern digital economy is throwing up so much data , which itself has become the raw material for new businesses based on data analytics . In the last century , a new resource was discovered , which spawned a fast-growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resource , found in mother earth , was oil . It led to hugely profitable mega corporations and near monopoly powers . It also influenced the geopolitics of the world for several decades . But oil is a depletable , non-renewable resource . And the world is moving to renewable energy for transportation . Just like oil spawned mega business and corporations , in the New World , "" data "" is the new resource driving the growth of large corporations . In this digital world , already Google , Apple , Amazon , Facebook and Microsoft are the five most valuable companies in the world with collective value of almost three trillion dollars . Their combined annual profits are more than hundred billion dollars . Behind the Chinese firewall , Alibaba and Tencent are the other two big giants . Almost ninety percent of all growth in advertising revenue in the United States , goes to just two companies , Google and Facebook . <p> Netflix which began as a "" piping "" company providing broadband connection , has also become a major producer of movie and video content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic originated by Netflix . This company knows who is watching what , when , how . It can anticipate the preferences and make suggestions , much like Amazon suggests what to buy , based on your buying behaviour , captured by the data trail you left on the company 's computers . In a short span of about 10 years , the data analytics focus has also changed . It was used to mine viewing habits so as to pitch advertisements and products via micromarketing to web users . Now the purpose of analytics , which combines artificial intelligence and machine learning , is to help consumers find appropriate services and products at the right price . AI can predict what you need to buy , or when your car needs to be serviced . <p> Nilekani says , thanks to initiatives like Aadhaar , India already has the infrastructure to clock data at a massive scale . Much will depend on what we , or businesses , do with that data . For instance , in the GST Network , there will be a billion transactions recorded every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by whom , at what price . Combined with the Fastag and Electronic Tollway systems , we will also track the physical movement . This could potentially help the Central Statistical Organisation to collect data on GDP on a real time basis . It 's like seeing economic activity on a dashboard . The Aadhaar system is authenticating almost 50 million transactions every day , and this is growing exponentially . Imagine Ola and Uber drivers who choose to display their past driving record tagged by Aadhaar authenticated transactions . Or imagine a low-income borrower with no collateral , who can provide a digital trail of past payments of bills and taxes to show that he or she is a "" responsible and creditworthy "" borrower . Use of social media data in providing microloans has begun in China . In India , there are 10 new licensed payment banks which will be doing millions of transactions every month , involving remittances , clearing , investment in mutual funds , deposits and so on . They can use the digital data thus generated to fine tune their product offerings better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities are limitless . Unlike oil , data is an infinite resource which will never deplete . The economics of data as business resource is yet to be fully understood . But businesses that have recognised the potential are already galloping ahead . Nilekani 's main caution was that we must ensure genuine data democracy and avoid data colonisation . Which means that the data ownership must be with the user whose transaction generates the data , and not with megalith corporations like Google or Facebook . If companies want to use your data , this should be on the basis of consent . Users should be free to disconnect from any platform , and carry their data with another competing platform company . This requires appropriate legislation that clearly defines who has the rights to use the data that a user generates by his or her transactions . On the issue of privacy , the speaker was silent , since the case is being heard in the Supreme Court . Clearly a great transformation awaits digital India in the next five years , and it is all centered around a resource called "" data "" ."
"<h> Helo : A Chinese app is saying Ni Hao and a lot more in India <p> Zhang Yiming is a known name in China . Originally from Fujian , a south-eastern province in China known for its people of enterprise , Yiming has created a hugely successful technology company with billions of users spending countless hours on its platforms : TikTok , Toutiao , TopBuzz and Vigo Video , to name a few . <p> In a recent meeting at the ByteDance headquarters in Beijing , Yiming said that India is the fastest growing market for his company . But , he wished , it was the US in an obvious reference to how thrifty the Indian market . He spoke like a true businessman , or a rather a true Fujian , seeking a better return on investment -- preferred in millions of dollars if the currency is an option . <p> Nevertheless , with millions onboarding data services and apps in India every month , the world 's second most populous country is a priority market for ByteDance . So much so , it has designed and launched Helo , a regional entertainment content platform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helo is the same as Toutiao , its wildly successful content app back home in China , but the features , user interface , and product are tailored for a random Ajit Kumar . <p> In less than four months of its launch , the Helo app is ranked No. 2 among the top free apps on the Google PlayStore by downloads . ( Over 90% of smartphones in India run on Android , Google 's phone operating system . ) Helo has over 20 million downloads since and records two million daily active users , said a person aware of Helo 's expansion plans but asked to stay anonymous . It has still some way to catch up with Sharechat , India 's top local language social app , with some 7.5 million DAUs three months ago but Helo 's performance has experts in the space sitting up and watching . <p> What 's more , ByteDance is spending freely its marketing dollars to acquire more users on the platform . <p> Zhang Yiming , founder of ByteDance <p> Helo is what you could call a China version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case , being Sharechat . The content on Helo is strikingly similar to what you would find on other regional content apps like Sharechat , DailyHunt , and Clip , to name a few . The difference : Helo is powered by arguably the world 's best technology algorithms in the space . <p> Helo is tracking the Sharechat trajectory . "" The thesis behind Sharechat is ' There is content and there is a community for that content . ' That 's why a copycat can launch and get market share , "" the person quoted above said . In fact , ByteDance came very close to investing in the latest round of Sharechat funding before deciding to launch its own app . <p> If you are surprised why you have never heard of Helo , it 's likely because you are not its target audience . Like Sharechat , Helo targets vernacular , small town , and new data users . Most likely found on a low-end Android smartphone , Helo is powered up when the data newbies have time to kill . <p> Take the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pune . Her phone has Sharechat , Helo , Clip , and WhatsApp and she says she prefers apps like Helo and Sharechat over WhatsApp because "" there 's news , jokes and funny videos of kids and old people "" on the platforms .

Helo and Sharechat , on the other hand , are 100% timepass , "" Behere says . <p> In Alwar , Rajasthan , Tejpal Singh , who drives a school pick-up van , says he was surprised by the regional content on Helo . Singh , who stumbled on the app through a Facebook ad , just last week , describes the content on the app as positive and entertaining .

Source : Sensortower <p> ByteDance did not agree to interviews for this story . <p> But , people around the company pointed to how it had cranked up its engine tom-tomming Helo . "" The company is spending anywhere between $5 million to $10 million as marketing expense in India and a majority of this expense is spent towards Helo , "" said the person quoted earlier . Helo has also had the best rate of retention of users so far , this person said , but this could not be confirmed by a second source . <p> It 's important to note that Helo is powered by one of the best technology giants in the world , known for its speed of execution . Though the ByteDance product team is based in Beijing , it has operations being run from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> "" ByteDance is a tech giant in China but they move with the speed of a startup . It 's a combination of a big company that has resources and money and agility and speed of a startup , "" said the person attributing this agility as the reason for Helo 's success . <p> ByteDance 's Toutiao , a content curation app that has over 120 million DAUs boasts of its users spending 74 minutes daily on the app . That 's more than average user spends on Facebook and more than twice the time they spend on Snapchat . Toutiao 's algorithms go a step beyond serving up content . During the 2016 Olympics , a Toutiao bot wrote news stories covering the event quicker than traditional media outlets and received read rates in par with these outlets . <p> The app uses machine and deep learning algorithms to source content that users will find most relevant . Much like Toutiao , Helo does n't depend on user information like demographics , age or gender to find relevant content for its users . The underlying technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent on articles , taps , swipes , pauses , comments , interaction on content posts , among other cues . <p> ByteDance 's algorithms have reached a level of sophistication where a user will find at least 10% of recommended posts as relevant , said Tony Li , founder of Geek2Startup , an entrepreneur community in China . Banking on this technology stack and regional content readily available across several popular platforms combined with marketing dollars , Helo has climbed the ranks . It has a team in India working to understand the nuances of the local market . <p> Li predicted that ByteDance has a higher chance of success in India as compared to Tencent ' s WeChat , which has disappeared into the sunset in India after its initial success . Globalisation is the next natural step for Toutiao after its China success . He points to the strong run TikTok has had in US . Key will be meeting the regional content demand here , added Li . <p> Google and KPMG in a report in March 2017 predict that the market of local language internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving English content users ( 199 million by then ) far behind . Rural Indian language internet users already have higher engagement spending 328 minutes a week on chat apps , social media , online entertainment , and news , as against 308 minutes spent by urban users . <p> Helo is not available in English . It is available in 14 regional languages and dialects : Hindi , Marathi , Gujarati , Bhojpuri , Hariyanvi , Rajasthani , Odia , Punjabi , Tamil , Telugu , Malayalam , Kannada , Bengali , and Assamese . Its feed , a mix of jokes , memes , funny GIFs and videos , Shayari , click-baity film gossip , comes from various other platforms . <p> "" The platform crawls and sources content from Sharechat , Instagram , DailyHunt , Clip among other platforms , "" the person quoted earlier said . The company also has its own content team that sources vernacular content based on the local understanding of the market . <p> "" ( ByteDance ) is spending rapidly on acquiring users in India in a space that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proven the potential of regional content apps , "" said Satish Meena of Forrester Research . Meena said that the Helo 's target users are mainly in Tier 2 and 3 towns and are roped in through ads on YouTube and Facebook . A lot of these are likely to be paid installs , added Meena , where the company hires a marketing agency to drive targeted installs . <p> As a product specifically tailored for rural Indians or new internet users , the Helo app is fairly simple to navigate through . It does n't ask to sign up or log-in when a new user first lands up on the app . <p> If you look at Sharechat and Helo , the app designs are very similar to TikTok where the landing page of the app is always "" trending "" content , noted Akash Senpaty , a product manager at Zynga and an expert at taking apart apps . Helo has also borrowed features from Twitter where a user can add comment on a post being shared . Senpaty said that even though these features can probably increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WhatsApp groups . Users are generally part of WhatsApp groups with similar interests and content relevant to those interests . What Toutiao -- or Helo -- is supposed to do by the tuning algorithms to a high fidelity , WhatsApp groups do with crowdsourced human intelligence with far more stickiness , Senapaty pointed out . <p> Apart from GIFs and videos , the app also tags timely and trending news content -- for instance , the ongoing #metoo movement in India , live cricket updates , and political developments . <p> Like Twitter , there are trending hashtags on the app that indicate politically inclined content : for example , content tagged with #OurModiDelivers or #BJPLayiBerojgari . The platform also has verified and official accounts of users . <h> Vernacular content : Undifferentiated ! <p> The two years since the launch of Reliance Jio 's 4G network services has been nothing short of a data revolution in India . The millions of Indian users -- new and old -- on the mobile internet today also opened up a whitespace between messengers such as WhatsApp and social media apps like Facebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penetration dramatically increased in the country and new internet users were looking for something to do on their smartphones . <p> Offering users a continuous stream of an entertainment feed , Toutiao found initial success among smaller cities and towns in China where the company could advertise cheaply . In its first year , the company acquired its first million users by spending only 1 million RMB ( $160,000 ) in promotions . Most of Toutiao 's users -- about 72% -- are located in China 's bottom-tier cities . The same holds true for Helo 's audience in India , except that Sharechat has the first mover advantage here . <p> Sharechat founded in 2015 as a chatbot used by a few thousand users has grown to a well-funded company clocking 7.5 million DAUs as of July this year . Sharechat steadily built momentum by building a platform that curated regional content . <p> "" The Chinese are still in hyper-growth mode , by scraping content from here and there to show a semblance of activity , "" said Himanshu Gupta , a former WeChat executive . WeChat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tussle with ByteDance due to the latter 's increasing dominance in China 's social media and online entertainment industry . <p> "" To get a content-based platform play right you need creators to generate content , curation and moderation of content , and consumers to view content on such social platform , "" Gupta said . "" Chinese are skipping the first two steps by scraping content and putting them via bots and focusing on the third part . "" <p> The first person quoted in this story also confirmed this about ByteDance 's execution style . The content business is a combination of three parts : the creation of content on the app , the ability to distribute and deliver relevant content to users using algorithms , and promoting the app , this person said . <p> Thanks to ByteDance 's phenomenal success in China backed by the power of its algorithms , Helo has the advantage of getting at least two of those three things right . It has the money to acquire users in India market and it has a tech stack that has helped it achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day on the Toutiao app . <p> Still , differentiation is a casualty . "" At present , there 's a lot of overlap in terms of content on Helo , Sharechat and other user-generated content apps . There is no major differentiation as such , "" said a rival startup founder , who asked to stay anonymous . "" In the long run , it is important for these platforms to be able to monetise these users , which will be challenging given that there is n't much stickiness based on the core propositions of these apps . "" <p> Also , in the months or quarters ahead , Helo 's parent will face pressures of a different kind : ByteDance that generated a revenue of $2.5 billion in 2017 is gearing up for an initial public offering , pointed out the first person quoted in this story without a name . An IPO will mean pressure to shore up profits and cut down on spending . So , even if Helo manages to outnumber Sharechat and secure the top spot in regional content in India , monetisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

"<h> Can Machine Learning Spur The Development Of Single Crystals ? <p> Controlling and observing single crystal growth in laboratories has many applications from manufacturing turbine blades to semiconductors . The advancement in the computational power of the modern day computers owes in large to the advanced material engineering techniques . <p> Growing single crystals is one such innovation , which is labour intensive and time-consuming . <h> Why Is It Difficult To Grow Crystals <p> Popular crystallizing techniques such as vapour diffusion , slow cooling , slow evaporation have been put to great use after years of research and most often than not trial and error based experiments . <p> Theoretically , crystallization should start when the concentration of a compound in a solvent is higher than the solubility product of this compound . Generally , however , crystallization is kinetically hindered and crystals grow only from supersaturated solutions . There are several ways to achieve this metastable state of supersaturation . <p> The easiest is increasing the concentration by evaporation of the solvent until crystallization sets in . Crystal growing depends on many factors . To begin with , there are parameters like raw material ratio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maximum temperature residence time and physicochemical properties such as elemental electronegativity , atomic radius , elements melting point , elemental volatility , the position of the atom in the periodic table among many others . <p> This problem resonates with something that is prevalent in many machine learning models- the curse of dimensionality . As the number of deciding factors to analyse increase , the complexity involved in achieving a satisfactory outcome increases . And , modern computing machines ( along with on-premise data centres , cloud etc ) coupled algorithmic advantage is built to do exactly the same ; churn complexities and make sense out of data . <h> How Does ML Help <p> The researchers used data like growth temperature curves , raw elemental compositions and ratios , and growth conditions . <p> The authors in this paper , experimented with support vector machine ( SVM ) , decision trees , random forests and gradient boosting decision tree to analyse which of the above factors really make a difference in crystal growth . <p> Accuracy , f1-scores , recall rates were used for successful sample predictions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fare against each other via paper by TangShi Yao et al. , <p> The results show that : <p> The SVM method is relatively stable and works well , with an accuracy of 81% in predicting experimental results . By comparison , the accuracy of laboratory reaches 36% . The decision tree model is also used to reveal which features will take critical roles in growth processes . <p> 10-fold cross-validation was used to analyze the model . The single SVM model used to predict experimental results has an accuracy of 80% in describing all the reaction types in its test-set data . The average accuracy over 10 training/validation split is 73% . <h> Future of ML In Physics <p> Earlier this year , researchers have demonstrated the use of deep learning for building nuclear reactors where an AI approach was undertaken with a greater focus for the Tokamak reactor , a doughnut-shaped machine that holds hot plasma using a powerful magnetic field . <p> High dimensional data like the temperature of electrons as a function of radius in the plasma from previous fusion experiments is fed into the Fusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplemented with the NVIDIA 's V100 GPUs as the task is computationally intensive and would require high-performance computing clusters . From condensed matter physics to plasma physics , deep learning methods are proving to be more efficient and economical than the conventional methods ."

"<h> Winning micro-moments in mobile e-commerce <p> Mihir Shinde , a technology executive &amp; entrepreneur with over 10 years of experience in the e-commerce space , says that the degree to which a mobile device can influence the buying decision of a user has never been greater . <p> Mihir is currently a Forbes Tech Council Member , a Royal Society Fellow as well as a Techstars Mentor . He currently works as the Head of Mobile Apps &amp; Strategy for B&amp;H Photo Video in New York . His work has been featured in both Apple 's WWDC and Google I/O conferences &amp; he has written for Forbes in the past as well . In addition , he is also the cofounder of Nandoo -- a one of a kind wellness ecommerce mobile app that is targeted for Indian Millennials . <p> The author of two books on e-commerce , took the time to speak to Fortune India Exchange about how the next big wave in mobile e-commerce is all about focusing on the micro-moments for mobile users . <p> Before we even address micro-moments , could you talk to us about the impact mobile devices have had on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's simply astounding how much of a dependency we have on our smartphones nowadays . <p> Research has indicated that roughly 68% of smartphone users said that they check their phone within 15 minutes of waking up in the morning , &amp; 30% admit that they feel anxiety when they do n't have their phone on them . <p> Whenever there 's a smidgen of a doubt in the consumer 's head , the first thing they do is whip out their smartphones &amp; start conducting the research . Nowadays , when the consumer enters even the retail store , they mostly do so in an informed fashion often conducting a lot of research beforehand on their phones . In a way , the footsteps that consumers used to take throughout the store to go &amp; peruse have been transformed to research conducted on mobile phones in this digital age . <p> Could you tell us about micro-moments &amp; why they are important ? <p> Micro-moment is a term that was coined by Google . They are basically moments where people reflexively turn to a device , which happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act on a need to learn something , do something , discover something , watch something , or buy something . These are intent driven moments where the probability of decisions being made is very high . <p> We do a lot more searches on mobile devices than on desktops . Whenever in doubt or if we need or want something , we go to our mobile devices . We check our phone approximately 150 times a day &amp; spend roughly 177 minutes on it each day just rummaging through streams of digital content . These stats mean that mobile sessions average about 1 minute &amp; 10 seconds long , several times a day . A lot of these moments consists of quick interactions such as uploading a video on Facebook , quickly WhatsApping someone , sending out an email whenever you have a few minutes from your daily routine , etc. which are n't really the best time to engage with brands , primarily because if a brand does then it will simply be dismissed . Relevance is key . There are other moments , where users are open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want help making our choices or coming to decisions . These are the moments that brands have to be ready for . <p> How do companies need to adapt their marketing strategy in order to work with micro-moments ? <p> Customization is very important here since it helps with key relevance . Companies need to really think about what the goal of the marketing strategy is &amp; how they can work towards that goal by catching users during their research phase . Research phase for these users shows an intent &amp; companies need to understand what the intent is so that they can target their marketing prowess accordingly . <p> One very important thing that I would like to mention is that it takes a whole hearted effort to get this going . Companies need to understand that you need cross functioning teams in order to make this happen since a lot of the tools , in order to get the whole job done well , lie with departments outside of marketing ( e.g. Technology , Operations , Customer Service ) . Such a concerted effort is a must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Does this mean that the non-mobile experiences , such as desktop , need to be less prioritized ? <p> Nope ! In fact , there is a role that desktop ( and other avenues ) still play . What mobile does is simply help get the user more informed &amp; with companies taking advantage of micro-moments , hopefully they can help the user in making the decision . However , the conversion is something that may or may not happen necessarily on the mobile platform -- it could very well happen on the desktop or perhaps even in-store . <p> In fact , research shows the following stats : <p> * 90% of people say they use multiple screens for everyday activities , such as booking a hotel or shopping for electronics <p> * 40% of people who research on a smartphone go on to purchase on a desktop <p> Instead of simply thinking of mobile &amp; desktop separately , its users need to basically be thought of as belonging in the same bucket . Companies need to rethink about how they measure &amp; evaluate the success of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their decisions up to the last second before a purchase is made . Nearly one in four shoppers have changed their mind about buying something while in the checkout line simply by reading something on their mobile devices . New conversion types must be accounted for &amp; companies should really think about measurement in a way that takes cross channel into consideration . And like I mentioned before , organizing your teams around this new way of thinking is a must too . <p> In addition to being an expert in mobile e-commerce , you are also the brains behind creating Nandoo- a pretty unique wellness / e-commerce platform for Indian users . Tell us the thought process behind building it . <p> I came across a study by Cigna TKK that found out that nearly 95% of Indian millennials admitted to being stressed -- most millennials than any other nation in the world ! It 's an alarming statistic , especially for a nation that founded relaxation techniques like mindfulness , meditation and yoga . One of the biggest triggers for this was Work . After logging long working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal life . Millennials prefer jobs that helps boost their personal as well as professional skills . But when their work does n't allow that , it makes them dissatisfied and leads to stress . And so , I realized that while I could n't do anything about the type of job &amp; satisfaction from it , I could leverage my mobile app &amp; ecommerce experience to create a unique Wellness based app . <p> We looked into what are the simplest things missing from Indian millennials ' lives that could be very easy to do but help reap massive benefits . After conducting research , we felt the best most organized way to approach this would be to categorize &amp; hit three main factors : Mind , Body &amp; Soul . Again , we wanted to keep it simple to start off with , so we added one easy to do exercise for each factor . For example , for Mind , we added a section where we deconstruct a complex topic in a simple , easy to understand manner -- WHY ? So that when our Nandoo-ers go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small talk conversations confidently . <p> For Body , we added a step tracker which you had to do for only 10 mins a day and utilize your efforts for an ecommerce experience wherein you get small gift cards for those efforts . For Soul , we added an intuitive breathing bubble which would help the millennials relax &amp; de-stress . <p> Our goal behind this application is for the millennials to adopt &amp; more importantly benefit from it . If we can just help bring that stress percentage down a bit , that would be a goal well met for us ! <p> How do you see Nandoo extending and what are some of the mobile strategies you are currently leveraging for it ? <p> We have received great traction for the application where we 're close to hitting 250k users in the span of just 6 months . This is an overwhelming response &amp; we could n't have hoped for a better start . Most , if not all of this traction , has come through word of mouth . <p> Next on the horizon is to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feedback &amp; build out features that we feel might add great value to the overall health &amp; wellness of our Nandoo-ers . One immediate thing we are working on and hope to address shortly is how to cater for the varying internet connectivity regardless of location . This has been a herculean task , but we are loving what we are learning and excited to unveil it soon . <p> In the longer term , we want to start incorporating more advanced technological innovations , such as artificial intelligence &amp; machine learning into the mix to help provide more personalized recommendations to our users so that they can get every last mile of benefits from Nandoo . We also want to keep the application more engaging &amp; we feel that augmented reality has a huge part to play in it . The recent product announcements made by Apple &amp; Google for mobile applications seem very promising , so the future looks bright on the mobile side for sure !"
"<p> The adoption of AI is increasing rapidly across the world with no industry remaining untouched by its impact . Most enterprises are already in agreement that artificial intelligence can bring unparalleled value to their organisation . However , the concerns over bias in AI systems and their efficiency are also not new . <p> A recent study shows that while 67 percent of consumers worry about AI discriminating against them , and 64 percent fear that AI will make decisions that affect them without their knowledge . <p> Sanjay Srivastava , CDO at Genpact does n't think of AI as artificial intelligence , he thinks of it as augmented intelligence - which augments a human 's capabilities with machine learning and AI for example . <p> AI and data analytics can bring possible solutions to us at amazing speed , but ' the last mile , ' the actual decision , he believes , still belongs to humans only and it is how enterprises can truly act with confidence . <p> In pop culture , AI is many times seen as a technology that will take over the world or will go rogue . However , that seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitfalls and real threats of AI adoption that companies should be wary of ? <p> One way to think about this is AI is a prediction capability -- and as good as it can be , it will always require judgment and action in responding to that prediction -- something that will always fall back to humans . This is the concept of "" humans in the loop "" and in the end , ensures the proper use of augmented intelligence . <p> But like anything else , you need to be thoughtful about how and where you apply AI . For example , in governance and ethics : Consumers and governments alike are becoming increasingly concerned about how data is being used by AI-driven technologies . The concerns are so great -- with issues ranging from algorithms that drive credit limits , to the use of facial recognition software for myriad reasons -- that governmental bodies around the world are taking action . <p> To help eliminate stakeholders ' and consumers ' worries about unethical or biased data use , we expect that many organizations will add Digital Ethics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple responsibilities : implementing ethical frameworks to make appropriate decisions about new technologies ; addressing considerations like data security and bias ; looking ahead to future technology challenges ; building new standards of technology governance ; and establishing new check-and-balance systems to ensure preventative measures remain effective <p> Challenge in adoption and need for modularization : The top barriers to AI adoption are the lack of skills to design , implement , and maintain AI solutions , and no clarity on where to use AI effectively . And so , we need to think about AI in modules -- in small components that can re-aggregate into larger business processes . <p> In many cases we have seen that AI suffers from a digital version of biases that hurt the physical world . How should tech leaders approach AI in such a way that there are no biases ? <p> I foresee that corporate boards are going to start thinking about ethical governance very differently . <p> As AI continues to increase its influence on business decisions , governments are taking steps to ensure that all AI usage is ethical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective decision-making without misuse of data . With these frameworks , businesses can build trust with consumers , which supports AI adoption , but also brand reputation . <p> As part of ethical AI frameworks , business leaders must encourage diversity . The goal is to have complete and comprehensive data samples that can cover all scenarios and users to eliminate bias . If we lack comprehensive data , external sources of synthetic data can fill in the gaps . Likewise , we should aim to have diverse teams with a wide range of skills and backgrounds , including digital and industry talent -- or better yet , people who can think from both sides . <p> Now more than ever , consumers expect business to do the right thing in all facets of their operations , and they will reward those that do so . Keeping ethics at the center of operations and technology implementation is essential . <p> AI and its ' impact on jobs ' , both terms have been synonymous for some time . Do you think AI is going to have a direct impact on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AI more ? <p> AI will have an impact on jobs , but not what most people think . My view is that the future of work will be less about AI impacting the number of jobs , and more about the need for humans to adapt their skill sets to leverage this digital age . <p> The successful workforce of the future will bring a trainable and curious mindset . Workers should n't fear AI or disruption but adopt a "" trainable "" and continuously curious mindset to prepare for a future of constant skills development and retraining . <p> Additionally , the way we learn will change , and businesses will put a greater emphasis on reskilling , upskilling and virtual training . However , mandated , one-size-fits-all reskilling and training programs do n't enable employees to discover their skills , identify their gaps , and hone their potential through customized knowledge paths and plans . <p> With Genome , Genpact 's internal learning framework , we are continuously preparing internally for the future of work by enabling our talent to acquire new skills and evolve quickly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Genpact 's more than 90,000 employees . <p> Genpact also announced that it is opening part of its internal learning platform , Genome , to the public"
"<h> A Beginner 's Guide To Attention And Memory In Deep Learning <h> Read Next <p> It might have never occurred to you how you could make sense of what your friend is blabbering at a loud party . There are all kinds of noises in a party ; then how come we are perfectly able to carry out a conversation ? This question is known widely as the ' cocktail party problem ' . Most of our cognitive processes can pay attention to only a single activity at a time . In the case of a party house , our capability of directing attention towards one set of words while ignoring other sets of words , which are often overpowering , is still a conundrum . <p> The key cognitive processes to solve a cocktail party problem are attention and short-term memory . This concept of attention and memory is a recurring theme in most of our daily processes . Being able to figure out what one sees or hears by just paying attention to chunks of information rather than the whole string of it , helps one react in real time . In short , it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a huge challenge when it comes to computational systems . <p> For machines , it 's all 0s and 1s and still , the concept of attention as we know it can be incorporated into them with well crafted algorithms . <p> Attention and memory have emerged as two vital new components of deep learning over the last few years . <p> The ability to focus on one thing and ignore others has a vital role in guiding cognition . Not only does this allow us to pick out salient information from noisy data ( cocktail party problem ) , it also allows us to pursue one thought at a time , remember one event rather than all events . <p> Attention in terms of neural networks can be thought of as a vector with important weights . The weights tell the network where to look at ( attention ) , and which pixel in an image or a word in a sentence to look at . The attention vector is used to predict how strongly it is related to other elements and approximate the target . <h> Attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DeepMind <p> Deep nets naturally learn a form of implicit attention where they respond more strongly to some parts of the data than others . <p> RNNs contain a recursive hidden state and learn functions from sequences of inputs ( e.g. a speech signal ) to sequences of outputs ( e.g. words ) . The underlying task here is to calculate a sequential Jacobian of an event . <p> The sequential Jacobian , which is a set of derivatives , shows which past inputs they remember when predicting current outputs . It is represented as follows : <p> Where x and y denotes the input and output vectors respectively . <p> The network produces an extra output vector used to parametrise an attention model . The attention model then operates on some data ( image , audio sample , text to be translated ... ) to create a fixed-size "" glimpse "" vector that is passed to the network as input at the next time step . The complete system is recurrent , even if the network is n't . <p> The model consists of a trainable embedding layer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recurrent neural network ( SHA-RNN ) , and a softmax classifier . The model uses a single head of attention and a modified feedforward layer similar to that in a Transformer , which is referred to as a Boom layer . Boom layer takes a vector from small ( 1024 ) to big ( 4096 ) to small ( 1024 ) . <p> The Boom layer is related strongly to the large feed-forward layer found in Transformers and other architectures . <p> Applications of employing attention and memory modules into the network : <p> Transformers , the models that have revolutionised NLP use attention mechanisms . When released in 2017 , it set new benchmarks for machine translations . This innovation even led to better models such as BERT , GPT and many more ."

This is sad because the newspaper was the greatest celebration of democracy we had . India literally voted through print . He added , "" In recent times , the only sense of mourning , laughter and life was when two film stars died . Bollywood rescued news . The reports on Irrfan Khan and Sushant Singh Rajput made news come alive . "" They were treated as model dramas , a source of mourning and debate . In this context , a person died . There was mourning , not a litany of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coming years , we will mourn the decline of the newspaper . A way of life is being lost , and the Covid has announced it . ( File photo : Reuters ) <p> Beyond the cases of Rajput and Irrfan , the news of the everyday is lifeless . You could substitute reports and hardly recognise the difference . Analysts I talked to brought a further twist to the argument . They listed that the change is not political but technological . "" Newspapers "" , they claimed , "" were mourning the death of print and announcing the real birth of the digital . "" <p> "" Covid "" , they claimed , "" has announced the birth of the digital era . The virus did not cause it , it merely formalised it . The new society has to be online . "" I admit , as an old addict of print , that I was shocked . I only get up in the morning because of filter coffee and a sheaf of newspapers . Print defined a sense of the social , and now analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> One of the first things that I keep encountering is the frequent use of the word "" the new normal "" . The government is calling for a return to normalcy when the virus has still got two months to peaking point . What has arrived is social media . What has been announced is the web in air . The web in the air is the new normalcy , the acceptable epidemic of academic and corporate life . One feels like a dinosaur if one has not performed this rite of passage to the new post-normal world . <p> The university has declared the post-normalcy by announcing seminars and digital classes . There is no question of transition or training . Look at the announcements of the Vice Chancellors . One says that the distinction between print and digital is over . Another literally adds , "" by becoming digital we are "" . Even the advertisements are signalling a transition to a different way of life . Corporate dons have announced the age of artificial intelligence . It is as if the virus , while not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology like a tabula rasa . The newspaper as an organism senses this , feeling its inadequacy before the social media . In the coming years , what we might mourn is the decline of the newspaper . Housewives will miss it as they want it to line the shelves . Old men will not read it in the parks . A way of life is being lost , the Covid has announced it . The real casualty of the Covid seems to be the newspaper .

"<h> A Complete Guide To Outlier Detection With Hands-On Implementation For Beginners <h> Read Next <p> To start off , one must need to know what an outlier is . An outlier is basically the value of a point or a data point who largely differs from the rest of the crowd . Let us try to understand this with an example : in a class of 20 students with heights ranging from 170cm to 215 cm . The average height is 175cm and the maximum is 195cm . So here , the one with 215cm largely differs from the group and thus the data point is called an outlier . Another term that is used prominently for an outlier is , "" anomaly "" . Also , a person with a height of 125 cm would have been considered as an outlier too . <p> Through this article , we will be discussing outliers , their impact and methods to treat the outlier present in the data . We will also demonstrate the hands-on implementation of these methods . <h> Impact of outliers <p> Now , let us understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to machine learning . <p> As we know that the data we use for training machine learning models is highly sensitive to missing or faux values , as it severely limits the accuracy of the model . For the same reason , we need to have a great understanding of the data we have . In that having a good understanding of outliers is equally important because outliers can severely affect the accuracy of the model that we desire to train . <p> Source : Medium <p> Here we see , 300 is clearly an outlier . I have also tried to show how an outlier really impacts the statistical dimensions of the data . An outlier largely impacts mean and thus standard deviation and obviously would do the same to variance . <p> Here just to give briefings : mean can be understood as the average of all the values , the median indicates the middlemost value in the data , the mode is the most repetitive value in the data . Standard deviation is the amount of variation of the values in the data that we are having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of given values is not that humongous but what to do when the number of data points is in tens of thousands . In such a case we can opt to identify outliers in the following ways : <h> How to identify Outliers and remove them ? <p> We simply can not always remove outliers just by seeing them . The method of removing the outliers differs from the type of data set you are working on . <p> But you can surely get hands of knowledge of a few really important methods . <p> If you look carefully at the bottom of the graph there you will see some red data points , these are exactly the ones who are under the lower quartile . We are not able to see them distinguishably because the number of green data points is the way for you to see the red ones . And moreover , the difference between the lower bound and the normal range is not that much for it to be clearly visible . <p> NOTE : <p> here we wanted to use the same parameters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use scatter plot when there are a lot of data points and especially when these data points lack variance . <p> We will be seeing and analyzing the rest two on a different dataset because not every data set can be used to show and implement all the methods . <p> Here standard deviation is helpful when there 's a normal distribution ( a bell-shaped curve ) that easily can be observed . <p> ( 10000 ? 3 is the shape of the data frame ) <p> #setting limits for outliers #constraining by using 3 std dev technique #one may take 2 std dev or even 4-5 std dev for the same , it totally depends on the type of the data being used **44;4198;TOOLONG ... print(upperlimit) <p> Another way of saying the same thing is to get data points that are more than 3 standard deviations away . <p> #the outliers <p> df(df.zscore&lt;-3) ( df.zscore&gt;3 ) <p> OUTPUT <p> Outliers Removed <p> This is exactly how one can identify outliers and according to the data and how the removal will impact , can remove the outliers . <h> Conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help beginners understand the concept of outliers , how to identify outliers and how to remove outliers . There are many more methods like IQR etc but these are sufficient for a beginner .

"<p> Adobe is on a mission to make Sensei the smart assistant -- by adding voice recognition capability to its applications and deep learning to a slew of tools . In fact , AI and machine learning was woven into most of the apps , whether it is for photo , video or illustration editing software . And buzzwords such as deep learning , neural networks and machine learning dominated every application . The reason was abundantly clear at the recently concluded , largestAdobe MAX 2017 conference at Las Vegas . Over the last two years , Adobe has significantly ramped up its AI engine -- Adobe Sensei , that powers most of its new features . <p> Shantanu Narayen , Adobe CEO believes artificial intelligence is going to be an amplifier and not some substitute for human creation . "" We think artificial intelligence will evolve , to help you fill that need . Machines can see patterns and possibilities that we may not be able to see immediately and our artificial intelligence technology which is Adobe Sensei is going to be different and will harness the collective intelligence of the entire creative community , "" emphasized Narayen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cloud since it was first launched it five years ago . <h> Analytics India Magazine lists down a few of Adobe 's AI tools that harness the power of AI and help people push their creative boundaries <p> ProjectSceneStitch : One of the most revolutionary tools , Scene Stitch , powered by Adobe Sensei , is basically used to fill large holes in images by querying a database of images and automatically finding content to fill the hole . Adobe engineer Brian Price who demoed the project demonstrated how the Content Aware Fill tool , enables the designer to highlight a part of a photo which he/she wants to remove and SceneStitch can fill the hole with the scene around it . Powered by AI , Project SceneStich can replace sections of photo and replace it with other relevant photos from the database . The groundbreaking part is that the algorithm compares the image to an entire database of photos and replaces the part with a relevant photo . One of the most impressive image editing techniques , this tool which is still in prototype stage can potentially out-phase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adobe , Content Aware tool allows designers to more than just fill the hole in the image , it is a way of reimagining and remixing content . <p> Project Cloak : Want to get rid of an unwanted object in your video . Adobe 's Geoff Oxholm shows the way by selecting the spot and allowing Content Aware Fill tool to do the rest . It works brilliantly when there is something freestanding in front of the background and also an object or a shadow , one wants to remove , explained Oxholm . "" Cloak enables removing unwanted things from a video by imagining what would appear if these unwanted things were removed , "" Oxholm said during the conference . The modus operandi -- first the user has to create a mask that selects the object/area in the video one wants to remove , and then the Cloak software will automatically and intelligently replace that area in each frame . <p> Project Puppetron : Demoed by Jakub Fiser , this groundbreaking projected elicited the most laughs for its hilarious renditions of Pakistani American actor and stand-up comedian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max 2017 . Essentially , Puppetron is a way to combine a series of facial photos with artistic portraits to create puppets directly usable in Character Animator . Strikingly similar to what Prisma does , Puppetron 's algorithm can analyze a portrait done in line drawing or some other medium , and apply that same look to a regular portrait photograph . And the final representation is strikingly accurate . It can be seen from the image where modern art sketch stylization is applied to the photo and the remixed result is strikingly accurate . <p> Project DeepFill : So you heard about the magical Content Aware Fill . Well , now Adobe has taken it one step further and developed a new deep neural network-based image in-painting system , powered by Adobe Sensei , that a ) learns to generate image patches that are visually realistic and semantically reasonable , and b ) allows interactive customization of results based on users ' brushing and sketch inputs . Adobe 's Jiahui Yu demonstrated how DeepFill is an more sophisticated spin-off of Content Aware Fill tool that does n't really understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pixels into the hole . We believe a good image filling system should be able to understand the image . "" To bridge this gap and solve the challenging hole filling problem , we introduce Project Deep Fill that leverages the power of Adobe Sensei , Deep Learning and Neural Networks to develop a tool that can understand the image . Can it mask an entire eyebrow ? It can successfully hallucinate a new eyebrow for you , "" explained Yu , during the conference . <p> Project Scribbler : Scribbler is one of those tools that will definitely give more power to illustrators , sketch artists , graphic designers and revolutionize the way magazines , agencies and newsrooms work by speeding up the colorizing process . The interactive , deep learning-based image generation system powered by Adobe Sensei , gives users an easy way to express their ideas and visualize their designs by performing simple sketching , and drag-and-drop operations and colorizing the end result . Demonstrated by Jingwan Lu , this tool can not only colorize sketches but also black and white photos . Besides colorizing , Lu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object ( in this case a handbag ) by sketching and the color and the pattern to go with it . You can crop the pattern and paste just to give the neural network some hint what you want the bag to look like , she shared . <h> Outlook <p> Adobe 's CEO Narayen has always viewed AI as a game changer , the most disruptive paradigm shift that would drive its revenues and would help the software giant woo more customers . This is the reason behind the soaring popularity of Adobe Sensei that frees users from repetitive tasks and will soon the creative fabric of the design community .

"<h> Three New Books on Human Consciousness to Blow Your Mind <p> At the moment , you 're reading these words and , presumably , thinking about what the words and sentences mean . Or perhaps your mind has wandered , and you 're thinking about dinner , or looking forward to bingeing the latest season of The Good Place . But you 're definitely experiencing something . <p> How is that possible ? Every part of you , including your brain , is made of atoms , and each atom is as lifeless as the next . Your atoms certainly do n't know or feel or experience anything , and yet you -- a conglomeration of such atoms -- have a rich mental life in which a parade of experiences unfolds one after another . <p> The puzzle of consciousness has , of course , occupied the greatest minds for millennia . The philosopher David Chalmers has called the central mystery the "" hard problem "" of consciousness . Why , he asks , does looking at a red apple produce the experience of seeing red ? And more generally : Why do certain arrangements of matter experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the nature of consciousness will have been struck by the sheer variety of explanations on offer . Many prominent neuroscientists , cognitive scientists , philosophers , and physicists have put forward "" solutions "" to the puzzle -- all of them wildly different from , and frequently contradicting , each other . <p> Let 's begin with what might be called the standard view : The brain is extraordinarily complex , containing some 100 billion neurons , each of them capable of forming connections with ( and exchanging signals with ) 10,000 other neuronal units . Though the details are far from clear , it is presumed that neuronal activity gives rise to the mind . This is what Francis Crick famously called the "" astonishing hypothesis "" ( in his 1994 book of the same name ) : "" ' You , ' your joys and your sorrows , your memories and ambitions , your sense of personal identity and free will , are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules . "" <p> Much else is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer , by processing information -- and if so , does it mean that machines could one day be conscious ? Depends on who you ask . How widespread is consciousness within the animal kingdom , and when did it evolve in our own lineage ? Depends on who you ask . <p> There is n't even unanimous agreement that the hard problem is the stumper Chalmers makes it out to be ; cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett and philosopher Patricia Churchland , for example , have argued that the neuronal ebb and flow inside a healthy human brain simply "" is "" consciousness . ( Churchland offers an analogy from physics : Though it took centuries to understand light , we now realise that light simply is an oscillating electromagnetic field . ) Contrast that with philosopher Colin McGinn 's claim that humans might not have the cognitive wherewithal to comprehend their own minds ; The puzzle of consciousness , he believes , is here to stay . <p> OK , let 's dive in . Christof Koch is one of today 's leading thinkers on the problem of consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught for many years at the California Institute of Technology , and is now president and chief scientist at the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle . In his new book , The Feeling of Life Itself , Koch advocates for integrated information theory , or IIT , developed by Giulio Tononi , a neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin -- Madison . IIT does n't ask how matter gives rise to consciousness -- rather , it takes as a given certain attributes of consciousness , and asks what kinds of physical systems would be needed to support them . And it 's quantitative : The theory purports to measure the amount of consciousness in a physical system ( denoted by the Greek letter phi , F ) by linking specific physical states to specific conscious experiences . <p> There 's some degree of experimental support for this : Tononi has devised a sort of "" consciousness meter "" that attempts to measure F in humans . ( Or does it ? Koch confesses that it actually measures something called the "" perturbational complexity index , "" which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brain -- which Koch says is correlated with F. ) The device gives a low reading for those who are in a deep sleep , or under anesthetic , and a higher value for those who are wide awake . <p> More sophisticated versions of this device may be of great value , Koch suggests ( in dealing with patients with various kinds of brain damage , for example ) , by distinguishing those in minimally conscious states from those in so-called vegetative states , or in a coma . <p> While this is laudable , it 's not immediately clear that it addresses the hard problem . As Koch is well aware , a critic would naturally ask why this "" integrated information "" should feel like anything ; could n't you have the same flow of information but without consciousness ? His answer is that the axioms at the heart of IIT "" fully delimit any experience "" so that nothing is left out ; any system that obeys the axioms of IIT , he says , must be conscious . I did n't find this fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But at least it attempts to study consciousness quantitatively , which is a start . <p> And what of intelligent machines ? A computer -- at least anything that functions like today 's digital computers -- could , at best , mimic consciousness ; it would n't actually be conscious , Koch argues , because it would lack the brain 's "" intrinsic causal powers "" ; he argues that the "" brain as hardware , mind as software "" analogy has been wildly oversold . <p> And then we come to the whopper : Koch argues that everything is a little bit conscious , a view known to philosophers as panpsychism . This , in Koch 's view , gets rid of the puzzle of how consciousness emerges from non-conscious neurons ( or atoms ) ; if he 's right , consciousness was there all along . <p> As Koch is aware , panpsychism by itself leaves many questions unanswered . Why , for example , is this arrangement of matter more conscious than that arrangement of matter ? But he believes that panpsychism and IIT , taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If Koch 's book had me occasionally wearing my skeptical-emoji face , Donald D. Hoffman 's latest , The Case Against Reality , had me doing the head-exploding emoji . Hoffman , a cognitive scientist at the University of California , Irvine , starts with perception rather than consciousness , but he 's clearly hunting the same prey as Koch . The main thing he wants you to know about your perceptions is that they 're wrong -- they 're not "" veridical , "" in his preferred language . <p> It 's not that everything is an illusion ; he believes there is such a thing as "" objective reality "" -- but he says our perceptions ca n't lead us toward that reality . His argument is rooted in a combination of Darwinian natural selection and game theory known as the interface theory of perception . <p> He offers an analogy with a computer screen : We can move an icon shaped like a file folder into the "" trash , "" but we do n't really believe the two-dimensional pixel-arrays actually contain files or trash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are useful in achieving goals . Similarly , we perceive the world around us through the interface of our senses . ( This is not a brand-new idea ; Kant suggested something similar almost 250 years ago , as did Plato in his allegory of the cave some two millennia earlier . ) <p> But surely our perceptions map in a mostly true way onto the real world , right ? No , Hoffman says : He argues that Darwinian evolution would favour an organism with less-accurate perceptions over one that perceived the world as it really is . He calls this wildly counter-intuitive proposition , on which the rest of the book rests , the "" fitness-beats-truth "" ( FBT ) theorem ; he says it can be proven through computer simulations . <p> And he goes further , arguing that neither objects nor the spacetime that they appear to inhabit is real . Same goes for neurons , brains , and bodies : "" Our bodies are messages about fitness that are coded as icons in a format specific to our species , "" Hoffman writes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through time , you 're actually seeing yourself as an icon inside your own data structure . "" No wonder he frequently refers to The Matrix . "" This book offers you the red pill , "" he writes . <p> I have a number of problems with this . Let 's start with the most obvious objection : If nothing is real , why not go play on the freeway ? After all , imaginary vehicles ca n't hurt imaginary-you . Hoffman 's reply is that he takes his perceptions "" seriously "" but not "" literally . "" But this , I think , is having it both ways : If you admit that speeding cars can harm you , that 's pretty much admitting they 're real . <p> And what about spacetime ? He says that "" eminent physicists admit that space , time , and objects are not fundamental ; they 're rubbing their chins red trying to divine what might replace them . "" <p> I think he 's at most half right . Yes , many of today 's leading physicists believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? We 've known for some 200 years that matter is made of atoms ( and the ancient Greeks had guessed as much ) -- but that does n't make matter less real . It just means that , depending on the problem at hand , sometimes describing the world in terms of atoms is helpful , and sometimes it 's not . But it would be bizarre to discount cars and tables and people just because we know they 're made of smaller stuff . And if space and time turn out to be some sort of approximation to a more fundamental entity , that will be a fascinating step forward for physics -- but even that wo n't render the stuff of everyday life less real . <p> OK , so if space and time and objects are n't fundamental , what is ? Toward the end of the book , Hoffman lays out the case that conscious minds are the fundamental entities that the rest of reality is made from ; it 's minds all the way down . He calls this the "" conscious agent thesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless they 're perceived by minds . <p> This sounds a bit like Koch 's panpsychism , but Hoffman says it 's different ; he calls his philosophical outlook "" conscious realism . "" Unlike old-school panpsychism , conscious realism offers hope for a "" mathematical theory of conscious experiences , conscious agents , their networks , and their dynamics . "" From such a theory , he hopes , all of physics -- including quantum theory and general relativity -- will eventually be derived . <p> I suspect it may be a long wait . I also think it 's a bit of a stretch to imagine that physicists , having given up on space and time , are ready to subscribe to this "" minds first "" world-view . Physicist Sean Carroll , for example , has made it clear that he does n't see this as a fruitful approach . On the other hand , physicist Lee Smolin , in his most recent book , puts forward what he calls his "" causal theory of views , "" in which the universe is described in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual event ; he hopes to derive space and time and the rest of physics from these "" views . "" Maybe some lucky convergence of thought will illuminate a link between Smolin 's "" views "" and Hoffman 's "" conscious agents . "" I 'm not holding my breath , but it 's not the craziest idea out there . <p> Meanwhile , Hoffman hints at other payoffs for those who venture down the rabbit hole with him -- like a new view of God , for example . ( This did not come as a complete shock , given that one of the book 's endorsements is from Deepak Chopra . ) The research program that Hoffman envisions "" can foster what might be called a scientific theology , in which mathematically precise theories of God can be evolved , sharpened , and tested with scientific experiments . "" <p> As an alternative to the red pill , I picked up Michael S.A. Graziano 's Rethinking Consciousness . His approach is different from that of both Koch and Hoffman , and at least superficially more in line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neuroscientist at Princeton , spent much of his career developing something called the "" attention schema theory , "" which attempts to show how consciousness arises from attention -- and from the brain 's ability to keep track of what it 's attending to . Attention schema theory does n't pretend to be a solution to Chalmers ' hard problem , but "" it explains why people might mistakenly think that there is a hard problem to begin with , "" Graziano writes . <p> The idea is that the brains of certain creatures are able to model the world around them -- an ability that Graziano believes evolved around 350 million years ago . This is a purely physical phenomenon , corresponding to specific brain activity that can be fully explained ( at least in principle ) at the level of neurons and neural connections . But the brain also performs a kind of "" meta "" processing of this information , keeping tabs of what the lower levels are doing , not in detail but in broad brush-strokes . <p> As Graziano sees it , this meta-level tally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness ; it explains why looking at a red apple also "" feels like "" having such an experience . This extra layer of processing -- the attention schema -- "" seems like such a small addition , "" Graziano writes , "" and yet only then does the system have the requisite information to lay claim to a subjective experience . "" <p> There is no ghost in the machine , but attention schema theory offers an explanation for why we imagine that there is . <p> Such a system need not be biological . Unlike Koch , Graziano believes that conscious machines ought to be possible , and -- more provocatively -- that uploading of minds onto machines may one day be a reality as well . ( He figures we 'll achieve uploading before we achieve interstellar travel ; many scientists , I suspect , believe the reverse . ) <p> There 's more , of course ; Graziano spells out the many ways in which truly intelligent artificial intelligence will change our lives ( mostly for the better , he believes ) . And there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brains in particular . But the real achievement here ( assuming we buy into it ) is that it takes the wind out of Chalmers ' hard problem by reducing it to a kind of meta-problem . ( Graziano points out that Chalmers himself has considered this approach . ) <p> Attention schema theory does n't live in a vacuum ; Graziano notes that it has some elements in common with Tononi 's integrated information theory , and Dennett 's own preferred model , known as the global workspace theory . These should all be investigated in parallel , Graziano suggests , in the hope that our final theory of consciousness will draw on each of them . <p> I have no idea if or when a consensus will emerge . But it is one of the compelling scientific problems of our time , and one that demands continuing inquiry . Crick put it eloquently in the last sentence of "" The Astonishing Hypothesis , "" a quarter century ago : "" We must hammer away until we have forged a clear and valid picture not only of this vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selves .

"<p> Facebook has been doing a lot in the field of natural language processing ( NLP ) . The tech giant has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in natural language understanding and language translation in recent years . <p> Now researchers at Facebook are implementing semi-supervised and self-supervised learning techniques to leverage unlabelled data which helps in improving the performance of the machine learning models . <p> Recently , researchers at Facebook introduced a new model known as Misspelling Oblivious ( word ) Embeddings ( MOE ) . This model is a combination of fastText and a supervised task which embeds misspellings close to their correct variants . <p> fastText is an open-source library which is designed to help build scalable solutions for text representation and classification . This library combines successful concepts like representing sentences with the bag of n-grams , using subword information and sharing information across classes through a hidden representation . <h> How It Works <p> MOE holds the fundamental properties of fastText and Word2Vec while giving explicit importance to misspelt words . This model can also be said as the generalisation of fastText where the former not only considers semantic loss but also considers an additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , spell correction loss aims to map embeddings of misspelt words close to the embeddings of their correctly spelt variants in the vector space . <h> Dataset Used <p> MOE embeddings are trained on a new misspelling dataset which is a collection of correctly spelt words along with the misspelling of those words . The total size of misspellings dataset contains more than 20 million pairs of instances and it is used to measure the spell correction loss . <h> How Is It Different <p> This model is different from other well-known word-embedding methods such as word2vec and GloVe . The current methods lack in providing embeddings for words that have not been observed during the training time -- or the Out-Of-Vocabulary ( OOV ) words . This leads to an unsatisfactory result as it allows to deal with the text which contains slangs , misspellings , etc . <h> Advantages of MOE <p> In real-world , while searching something on the web or chatting with someone , etc. humans often input text which contains misspellings . This new method will help in improving the ability to apply word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used in various domains like customer-centric enterprises to gain actionable insights from the customers ' reviews and feedbacks , chatbots , music , and video recommender systems , among others . <h> Importance of Word Embeddings Model <p> Word embeddings are like miracle drugs in resolving NLP tasks and they have eventually bettered various machine learning models . This method has been used thoroughly in machine translation , named entity resolution , automatic summarization , information retrieval , document retrieval , speech recognition , and others . At the present scenario , one of the most used forms of word embeddings is Word2Vec which is used to analyse the survey responses and gain insights from customer reviews , among others . But with the advent of MOE , there will be a huge difference in the way word embeddings used to work for NLP tasks .

A lover of music , writing and learning something out of the box . Contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can You Learn Machine Learning Without Linear Algebra ? <p> Machine learning is a field that has emerged out of numerous innovations in computational sciences , spanning centuries . So , can a machine learning enthusiast skip linear algebra and flourish ? The short answer is -- NO . <p> However , that 's not a complete picture . <p> Linear Algebra is a branch of mathematics that is widely used throughout science and engineering . Good understanding of linear algebra is essential for understanding and working with many ML algorithms , especially deep learning algorithms . <p> To understand this better , we are listing down the areas where an ML enthusiast will run into linear algebra in the preliminary stages of machine learning : <p> Scalars , Vectors , Tensors : Finding the modulus ( size ) , the angle between vectors ( dot or inner product ) and projections of one vector onto another and to examine how the entries describing a vector will depend on what vectors we use to define the axes <p> Matrices : Matrices can transform a description of a vector from one basis ( set of axes ) to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflection to an image and manipulate images . <p> Length squared sampling in matrices , Singular value decomposition , Low-rank approximation are few techniques which are widely used in the data processing . <p> For example , the singular value decomposition finds the best-fitting k-dimensional subspace for k= 1,2,3 , ... , for the set of N data points . Here , "" best "" means minimising the sum of the squares of the perpendicular distances of the points to the subspace , or equivalently , maximising the sum of squares of the lengths of the projections of the points onto this subspace . <p> SVD is traditionally used in the principal component analysis ( PCA ) , which in turn is popularly used for feature extraction and for knowing how significant the relationship among the features or properties is to an outcome . <p> The word ' mathematics ' brings in a ton of concepts -- and this might scare away the beginners . However , if one manages to look closely , then much of the maths used in basic ML is usually covered in high school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between points , the shorter path between points and for this , one needs linear algebra . <h> Why Reinvent The Wheel , When We Have Python Libraries <p> There is no denying the fact that building ML algorithms from scratch is a thing of the past . Modern-day programming platforms offer plenty of options where a single line of code would invoke a monstrous algorithm in the background . This works for those who want to get an idea of how ML plays out . However , if one is even remotely serious about putting an ML model into production then many issues surface . <p> For instance , a neural network is built around simple linear equations like Y = WX + B , which contain something called as weights W. These weights multiply with the input X and play a crucial in how the model predicts . The prediction scores can go downhill if a wrong weight gets updated and as the network gets deeper i.e addition of more layers ( columns of connected nodes ) , the error magnifies and the results miss the target . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already known of the presence of a system of simple equations that govern simple neural networks . With this knowledge , one can not only build the intuition of how a model performs but can also use it to compare with other models . Because , when we say a model is different , what it actually means is that equations are different . <p> One can build on this knowledge to learn about how the models optimise in the case of using gradient descent methods and how the change in learning rate signifies the performance of an algorithm . <p> via 3Blue1Brown <p> The last century has seen tremendous innovation in the field of mathematics . New theories have been postulated and traditional theorems have been made robust by persistent mathematicians . And we are still reaping the benefits of their exhaustive endeavours to build intelligent machines . The field of machine learning is built on some ingenious mathematical and logical hypotheses and tools . <p> There are other rudimentary topics , which can make the life of a typical machine learning engineer easy : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Learning &amp; Artificial Intelligence <p> APIs are a set of tools and protocols used for building software and models .

"<h> While 35 per cent Indian workers need at least 6 months of reskilling , 10 per cent need more than one year of training to meet the demands of the new workplace , the World Economic Forum report says . <p> New Delhi : The Fourth Industrial Revolution will make 75 million jobs obsolete by the year 2022 , but also create 133 million new jobs -- a net gain of 58 million , according to a new World Economic Forum ( WEF ) report titled ' The Future of Jobs 2018 ' . <p> The primary disrupters of the existing job market are emerging technologies such as robotics , artificial intelligence ( AI ) and automation . <p> The authors of the report have also warned that if the transitions to the workplace of the future are managed poorly , it would result in increased risks of widening skill gaps , greater inequality and rising polarisation . <p> For India , the WEF report predicts , 54 per cent of workers across 12 industries would need to be reskilled by 2022 .

That translates into 830,000 jobs per month for the next 12 years . Another estimate indicates that there will be more than 104 million fresh entrants in the labour market by 2022 . <p> Evolving technologies such as AI could complicate these estimates -- because it 's not immediately clear how many of these new entrants will have the skills to take up the newer kinds of jobs . To put it differently , we need to ask : Is India producing the right kind of workers for the jobs of tomorrow ? <p> Skilling India <p> ' Skill India ' is one of Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's pet missions .

"<h> How Self-Taught ML Expert Agnis Liukis Became A Kaggle Grandmaster <h> Read Next <p> "" I 've exchanged most of my evenings of watching TV for evenings of competing on Kaggle . "" <p> Agnis Liukis <p> For this week 's ML practitioner 's series , Analytics India Magazine got in touch with Agnis Liukis from Latvia , who is a Kaggle Grandmaster ranked 14th in the global leaderboard . He shares his insightful journey , tips and tricks in this interview . <h> How It All Began <p> Despite featuring in top 10 of the highly competitive Kaggle contests , Agnis , surprisingly , is neither a data scientist nor a machine learning engineer . He currently works as a Lead Software Architect in TietoEVRY , Latvia where his main focus is on developing web solutions for the backend and frontend . His foray into machine learning is a combination of keeping up with trends and his love for programming and mathematics . <p> He has a Master 's degree in Information Technology , and all his Kaggle accomplishments are the direct result of his zeal to know more . Agnis is self-taught , and his journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a career was getting more attention globally . Agnis found this domain to have a promising future and started taking online courses . He started with the course from Andrew Ng , which he also recommends to beginners . <p> However , he soon realised that theory would only take him so far . He wanted to get hands-on experience of dealing with machine learning models . His search for high-quality machine learning challenges landed him in the coveted Kaggle community . <p> "" At the beginning , there 's a lot of information to learn . One must learn theory to understand different algorithms , their weak and strong sides , and when to use which of them . They must also know things like what 's overfitting and how to deal with it . And many more things . And in parallel , there 's a lot of tools and frameworks available -- they will have to be learned as well , "" says Agnis , remembering his initial days . <p> Though he was n't new to Python , it took him some time to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be successful in competitions , like LightGBM , XgBoost , Scikit-learn , Matplotlib etc . Today , after having participated in more than 100 competitions on Kaggle , Agnis has eight gold medals and is currently ranked 14th out of 1,39,500 participants . <h> Kaggle Journey <p> "" One does n't have to be an expert to start competing . In my first competition on Kaggle , I got a silver medal based on my knowledge in Math and Probabilities . "" <p> Agnis says that the yearning for competition comes to him naturally . Be it sports or computer games , he likes to compete . "" So it was quite natural for me to enter the world of Competitive Data Science once I decided to learn Data Science , "" says Agnis . <p> When it comes to approaching a problem on Kaggle , Agnis says that he would first read and try to understand the underlying problem , the data and its purpose . When it comes to data exploration , he underlines the importance of looking at raw data , which is essential , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching data from "" heights "" -- looking at some general statistics , distributions , trends and so on . But sometimes , key insights are hidden in raw data values . "" <p> "" For example , some competitions have a special pattern of digits after comma -- like many values ending with .33333 , .66666 and so on , which give some clues about how this data was obtained and how to use that information to improve the score . And things like this ca n't be seen from general statistics , but only from raw data , "" explained Agnis . <p> When some working pipeline is ready , he would usually make some initial submissions to calibrate the cross-validation , which he considers to be an essential strategy as it helps in better generalisation and allows to avoid overfitting on the public leaderboard . He reveals that falling during shake-up when a private leaderboard is revealed is one of the most threatening things all competitors are afraid of . Hence , good cross-validation is a key factor in avoiding this . <p> Achieving the top spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the importance of taking out some time to learn things , to explore data , to write code for models , do experiments , read and explore ideas in a competition forum . Time is a significant differentiator , and he laments about lacking the same right now as he has a full-time job and a family . "" Basically I 've exchanged most of my evenings of ' watching TV ' for evenings of ' competing on Kaggle ' . That 's more fun and also more useful , "" quipped Agnis . <p> Agnis looks at Kaggle as a great way to stay up-to-date with all bleeding-edge technologies and approaches in Data Science and Machine Learning . <h> Tips , Tricks And Tools <p> For competitions , Agnis typically works with his home computer ( 16 GB RAM ) , which he considers to be enough for most of the problems , or at least for tabular data and NLP . For computationally intensive contests , he prefers to create a virtual machine on Google Cloud Platform with desired power . <p> However , he reminds us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition "" format , requiring submissions to be made through Kaggle kernels , and he often uses resources offered by Kaggle , which is about the same power as his home computer , but with an advantage of launching multiple kernels in parallel . <p> "" Fail fast when testing new ideas . If an idea is not working , simply forget about it and try something new . "" <p> To avoid getting caught up in non-working ideas for weeks and wasting a lot of time , Agnis recommends the participants to move on to the next idea as soon as possible . That said , Agnis does admit to giving his failed ideas one final shot before scrapping them just in case there are any bugs . <p> When it comes to libraries , Agnis expresses his fondness for LightGBM , mainly due to its speed and low memory requirements . LightGBM is also his primary option for all tabular data problems . For neural networks , he prefers the popular Keras library . For the rest of Data Science tasks in Python , he finds Pandas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Talking about how smart one needs to be to go from good to great , Agnis took the example of one of the competitions , which he has won by teaming up with Evgeny Patekha . The competition titled ' Sberbank Russian Housing Market ' deals with predicting house prices in Moscow . Agnis recollected how hard the dataset was and how difficult it was to get stable cross-validation due to the small size of data and many significant outliers . <p> The summary of his thought process that fetched him gold : <p> there were two significantly different types of products there , and critical factor was to notice that and train separate models for each type ; <p> only one of those product types contained outliers , therefore , using only the other type for CV worked well ; <p> The strongest feature when predicting price there was the full area of the house , but it contained a lot of errors in data ( like typos , unrealistic values , etc . ) . So , remove the most powerful feature and include it in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Triumphs <p> When asked whether the hype around machine learning is real , Agnis stayed loyal to his opinion from the initial days about how promising data science would be . He opined that machine learning is here to stay and its importance will only grow in the coming years as we collect more data , leverage more computer power , tweak algorithms and make them affordable . <p> He also speculates that there will be tremendous opportunities for the AutoML field as many companies can not afford hiring good data scientists for building models from scratch . However , he also warns us that many people think machine learning to be some kind of super algorithm which can solve problems perfectly . For instance , he explains , using computer vision for medicine can not be taken to be 100% perfect as the impact of failure can be huge . But , an ML model can assist a doctor in assessing results more confidently . <p> "" ML helps only if it is used in a smart way ; understanding what it can do and what it ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting hands-on with real ML tasks or competitions as soon as possible because courses and theories may seem clear and straightforward . But , when one is tasked with 1 million rows of raw data , the real training begins ! <p> For the participants who are looking to top the Kaggle leaderboards , Agnis advises that using good models just wo n't win the competitions . "" To stand out and get some real advantage , it is necessary to do something different , find something that others did n't notice . And creativity is something that really helps in this . Another thing is patience and endurance , as most creative ideas wo n't work and it can take many iterations and experiments to get things working , "" concluded Agnis."
"<p> Imagine you are sipping coffee at a cafe during your break , and your smartphone pings to remind you that the holidays are around the corner -- it 's time to plan a getaway . A touch reveals a list of likely locations prepared by your personal digital advisor ( aka your smartphone ) based on your preferences , past travels , and your recent searches . You shortlist a few and the search engine prompts you to take a virtual tour after generating a QR ( quick response ) code to be scanned at any kiosk to take a virtual tour of the destination attractions and connect with your wearable devices . You conference with your friend and tour a scenic location together online . <p> The virtual tour replicates not just the sights , but also the sounds and smells one might experience . The final location is decided and you pick flights , hotels , and excursions using virtual/augmented tours . You link your biometric data to be used at the time of customs , hotels and airline check-in . Finally use your crypto account to make payment partly using points , coins and cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's done ! And it 's time to head back to office . <p> You just visited three continents , explored four or five cities together , all during a coffee break . That was fast , efficient , exciting , and immersive , was n't it ? <p> This traveller of the future will be much more tech-savvy , driven by experiences and a focus on value-for-money , and will interact differently with the world . Research has shown that millennials and Generation Z , who comprise about 60% of the global population , are more likely to pick a travel destination and stays based on their social media feed than relying on a paid advertisement . <p> The emergence and acceptance of the sharing economy , with companies like Airbnb , OyoRooms and BlaBlaCar , has struck a chord with enterprising and cost-conscious travellers . It has also created completely new dynamics on the supply side by helping monetization of personal assets and bringing unorganized budget hotels or lodges in the mainstream . <p> SEAMLESS EXPERIENCES <p> The journey of a traveller from search to discovery to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or her need of a seamless experience , adventure , personalization , instant gratification , and reliance on peer-to-peer feedback . <p> These travellers are growing . According to a report by World Tourism Organization , it is estimated that by 2030 , people will take 1.8 billion international trips . In 2017 , India generated about 24 million outbound trips , both business and leisure , which is going to increase significantly going forward . While this is the change we will witness in future , the disruptions are already underway . <p> Augmented reality is being used currently for language translation by pointing smartphone cameras at words , navigation , and routing . An example is the interactive metro maps for the New York subway . <p> Virtual reality is bringing destinations and accommodation closer to the traveller , allowing travellers to explore destinations that he or she can select and experience before making the booking . Some of these firms go as far as to use wind machines and olfactory stimulants to replicate not just the sights but also the smells and sounds . <p> Internet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process -- in the form of voice-enabled hotel search in Alexa through Kayak and reservation via booking.com , keyless digital entry in hotels , baggage tracking and notification , and seamless integration of your own devices with the inter-connected devices in hotel rooms . <p> Artificial intelligence-driven engines are learning more about consumer behaviour -- the more the AI engine knows about you , the better recommendation it will be able to provide along with customized emotional or economic benefits from the providers . Mobility startup Mobacar , for instance , uses machine learning to predict the mode of transport and type of vehicle a traveller may want and pushes only relevant offers , while travel assistant Mezi uses natural language processing to provide a personalized experience to business travellers who usually are short of time . <p> Biometrics can help simplify the journey and may replace the identity documents , maybe even passports , through fingerprint , facial or iris recognition at customs , hotels and airline check-ins . <p> Robotics is being used in automating monotonous tasks . Customer service robots already exist at Munich , Bologna and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , deployed at Frankfurt Airport , answers questions about the gate for airline departures , can direct passengers to specific restaurants and help them access the airport 's free Wi-Fi . In Sasebo , Japan , a hotel is run almost entirely by robots enabling check-in at reception and luggage transfer to rooms . <p> Blockchain is also seen as a future disruptor of the entire travel value chain through increased disintermediation and democratization . It has the potential to remove intermediaries and balance the bargaining power in the hands of online travel agencies ( OTAs ) , and inventory owners . For instance , Winding Tree is a decentralized travel distribution platform for inventory tracking and Travala is a travel booking marketplace that ledgerizes and decentralizes the hotel industry , allowing users to add rooms backed by smart contracts . <p> These new age technologies will also have implications related to customer data , usage , storage and accessibility and are bound to give rise to data and privacy regulations . <p> THE NEW AGE CUSTOMER <p> While the customer is evolving and being pampered by the choices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rise of other inventory providers like online travel aggregators , metasearch agencies and digital tour guides will also ensure that the business model on the supply side shifts . Today hotels and other inventory owners have less bargaining power at the hands of large online travel agencies ( OTAs ) but are coping as the cost of customer acquisition has reduced . But they are constantly grappling with the question of how much commission they should give away to the online travel aggregators . <p> On the other hand , the hotel and airline loyalty programmes , which were a big driver of stickiness , are no longer a key criterion for customers . If they are getting a good deal on a platform , their loyalties shift . Old tour operators and travel agents are becoming irrelevant . <p> The future of the travel and hospitality sector will also be an era of alliances , where today 's disruptors get disrupted , making way for a new and sustainable ecosystem . <p> The current complex travel ecosystem will consolidate and equalize power of demand and supply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value chain and visionary companies will try to gain direct access to either customers or inventory . There is potential for the direct foray of technology giants and social media players into the travel ecosystem as they have access to customers which may disrupt the online travel aggregators . Alliances are expected to eventually pave way for a viable ecosystem . The boundaries are blurring and partnerships are emerging . <p> For example , Marriott has partnered with Alibaba 's OTA Fliggy to access Chinese tourists , while Amazon has partnered with Kayak for voice-based bookings through Alexa . Collaborations such as Airbnb 's latest investment in Oyo Rooms will also change the way the industry grows . <p> Technology players like Google are making the local intermediary roles relevant again with its Google Trips , a personalized tour guide app connecting local tour operators to travellers . Travellers are bound to gain the maximum value for the money spent and will be spoilt for choice as they will be at the heart of innovation . Today , smartphones are acting as personal digital assistants and in the future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the provider side , a minimum viable ecosystem of travel and hospitality players is likely to emerge , with direct access to either inventory or customer . <p> Rajat Mahajan and Parminder Saluja are partner and manager , respectively , at Deloitte India ."

The system will use the Slingshot fabric in Cray 's Shasta systems and run a combination of systems software from Cray and a set of yet-to-be defined programming libraries that Intel calls OneAPI . <p> The 2021 target could mean a fairly tight design cycle for the new Intel GPU in the works , said veteran graphics analyst Jon Peddie . Alternatively , the Aurora accelerator might be an FPGA or multicore x86 part replacing the discontinued Xeon Phi or a hybrid . Intel could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ship later this year in versions for AI training and inference . <p> Worldwide , at least eight major exascale systems are in the works , including the three U.S. efforts . Three projects are competing in China to launch as early as 2020 , although experts believe that they may not get up and running until 2021 . <p> "" It might be a nail biter "" to see who gets bragging rights of having the first exascale system , said Jack Dongarra , a co-author of the Top 500 supercomputer list and a professor at the University of Tennessee . <p> A supercomputer roadmap for U.S. national labs . <p> A quick survey of exascale efforts around the globe <p> One exascale project in China is a follow-on of the Sunway TaihuLight in Wuxi , currently the world 's third most powerful system . It uses a whopping 10.6 million proprietary cores to deliver 93 petaflops . <p> The second China effort is a follow-on to the Tianhe-2A in Guangzhou currently using Xeon CPUs and Matrix-2000 accelerators designed by China 's National University of Defense Technology . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's third exascale effort is a new project led by server maker Sugon with x86 chips believed to be derived from AMD 's Zen core as part of a 2016 joint venture . <p> Elsewhere , researchers in Europe and Japan have separate exascale efforts , both based on Arm cores . Fujitsu is building the Post-K system and Bull is leading the European effort . <p> All of the systems aim to handle a mix of traditional high-performance computing jobs such as complex simulations as well as emerging workloads based on deep learning and other analytics algorithms . As such , the new systems will be important in proving grounds for accelerator technologies already popular in the Top 500 . <p> So far , Intel listed only generic ingredients for Aurora . <p> Nvidia GPUs are , by far , the most popular accelerators in the Top 500 systems , distantly followed by Intel 's Xeon Phi , now being replaced presumably by its next-generation GPU . Intel dominates in CPUs , appearing in more than 95% of the systems . <p> The systems are typically measured using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use lower-precision math , meaning that these tasks could effectively see performance in the range of multiple exaflops on the new systems , said Dongarra . <p> Exascale systems are also expected to break new ground in optical networks and interconnects . For example , Intel said that it plans to use silicon photonics in the Aurora system . <p> "" In general , the new systems will create another wave of acceleration across many areas of science , technology , and health care , "" said Rick Stevens , an associate lab director at Argonne , announcing the Intel/Cray deal . <p> Aurora will handle a broad range of jobs for DoE and academic researchers . They include materials research in batteries and photovoltaics , earthquake and climate forecasting , and optimizing efficiency of wind turbines , as well as studying cancer and traumatic brain injuries in veterans ."
"<h> Now , outsource standing in queues at ATMs , banks <p> Aparna Desikan <p> TNN Nov 24 , 2016 , 05.29 AM IST <p> CHENNAI : Vignesh R from T Nagar was in urgent need of cash when he decided to call personal assistance services to make them stand in the queue outside banks on their behalf .

"<h> The Real Reason Why America Is Inviting Public Comments On AI Patents <p> In its history of over 200 years , the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) has granted over 10 million domestic patents . Now it seems that America 's highest authority on patents is a little cautious about understanding artificial intelligence in detail to help grant AI-based patents . This seems to be the case , as USPTO has invited public comments on various patent-related issues . <p> USPTO said that it is for evaluating whether further examination guidance is required for encouraging the reliability and predictability of patenting AI inventions . UPSTO has already published 12 questions relating to several AI patent issues , covering a diverse set of subjects ranging from patent examination policy to whether novel types of IP protection laws are required . <p> Here are the 12 questions that USPTO is seeking public comments on : <p> What are the elements of an AI invention ? <p> What are the different ways that a natural person can contribute to the conception of an AI invention and be eligible to be a named inventor ? <p> Do current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take into account inventions where an entity or entities other than a natural person contributed to the conception of an invention ? <p> Should an entity or entities other than a natural person , or company to which a natural person assigns an invention , be able to own a patent on the AI invention ? <p> Are there any patent eligibility considerations unique to AI inventions ? <p> Are there any disclosure-related considerations unique to AI inventions ? <p> How can patent applications for AI inventions best comply with the enablement requirement , particularly given the degree of unpredictability of certain AI systems ? <p> Does AI impact the level of a person of ordinary skill in the art ? If so , how ? For example : Should an assessment of the level of ordinary skill in the art reflect the capability possessed by AI ? <p> Are there any prior art considerations unique to AI inventions ? <p> Are there any new forms of intellectual property protections that are needed for AI inventions , such as data protection ? <p> Are there any other issues pertinent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are there any relevant policies or practices from other major patent agencies that may help inform USPTO 's policies and practices regarding patenting of AI inventions ? <h> Ensuring The Reliability Of Future AI Patents <p> The reason why USPTO is looking to gather public information on AI patents is because of the varying levels of potential uncertainties in such patent filings . AI methods and systems can differ in their technical implementations and also rely on a large amount of training by developers , inventors and system users , according to USPTO . The agency reported that it has been looking into AI and related inventions for decades now and although it has already issued several guidelines in this regard , it is reevaluating those to ensure the reliability of future patents . USPTO has reported it seeks more engagement with the technology community and AI experts to continue working on future guidelines related to granting AI patents on the inventions . <p> "" With respect to AI inventions to date , the USPTO has issued thousands of patents on AI technologies , and the future grows more exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with excitement comes change , and the potential for uncertainty . Therefore , the USPTO must continue to ensure an appropriate balance in the administration of our IP system , "" said Laura Peter , Deputy Director of the USPTO . <p> There are multiple complexities that may arise that make granting patents on artificial intelligence challenging . For example , as per the prevalent patent seeking guidelines of USPTO , applicants of AI inventions are required to present a written description along with a sufficient disclosure of the algorithm that performs a perform a claimed function . This is done so it can be reasonably concluded that the inventor had possession of the claimed invention . USPTO asks whether there needs to be a change in the level of detail an applicant must provide in order to comply with the written description requirement , particularly for deep-learning systems that can have a large number of hidden layers with weights that evolve without human intervention during the learning/training process . <h> Overview <p> At a time when AI inventions are taking the world by storm , USPTO 's stance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This will help in increasing the reliability and predictability of future patents in the US and for other countries to learn from . Apart from patents , USPTO is also looking to examine the full spectrum of intellectual property policy issues that have arisen due to advancements in artificial intelligence technologies . This includes economic frameworks created as a result of AI innovation , patents , trade secrets , trademarks and copyright issues . This will help with any lack of legal clarity on inventions , laws and policies related to AI . <p> Vishal Chawla is a senior technology journalist at Analytics India Magazine , and writes on the latest trends in the world of analytics , AI and other digital technologies .

"<p> A slew of emerging technologies is shaping our lives , arguably at a rate of change never seen before in history . Enabled by cheap computing power and access to large data sets , machines are already doing a better job than humans in several areas . <p> This ' intelligence ' is moving away from central server farms into devices and things that will soon become part of our daily lives . These devices will potentially negotiate their own way in our world via ' smart contracts ' and without significant human intervention . <p> While there is significant ground to cover , India is promisingly poised to take advantage of this gathering storm of opportunity . As these technologies move out of the research labs and innovation hubs in Silicon Valley towards real-world implementation , India offers an opportunity to implement at a scale that is probably matched only by China , according to an exclusive EY-Mint Emerging Technologies Report that was released during the Mint Digital Innovation Summit on 15 March in Bengaluru . <p> As India goes digital , data sets about various facets of Indian consumers and businesses are becoming available to fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headfirst into the race to apply these technologies and data sets to solve unique Indian problems including agriculture , urban transport , energy management , financial inclusion , small format retail to name only a few . <p> Last , but not the least , the government is taking several steps to spur the adoption of emerging technologies . <p> However , there is a lot more to be done . To be able to compete with the US and China , India will need to invest significantly more to create a conducive environment to foster innovation and attract talent , as this report indicates . The dialogue is not just about survival , but the willingness to fight and thrive to stay ahead of the curve . The question is : Are you ready ? <h> Key emerging technologies : AI <p> It is catalysing transformation in every industry -- helping companies transform the customer experience , launch digital products and services , and optimize supply chains . We see significant investment from big tech firms focused on horizontal AI platforms and start-ups focused on niche domain solutions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good quality data that can be used to learn AI algorithms . While ' point AI solutions ' are flourishing , we see a clear trend towards enterprises adopting a ' general AI ' approach that unifies their efforts across their business functions . As China and the US fight for AI supremacy , India has the potential to become an AI powerhouse given the large talent base and access to consumers willing to try new AI enabled products and services . <h> Internet of Things ( IoT ) <p> As billions of devices , services and systems get connected , we see consumers benefiting from improved lifestyle use cases and companies becoming more efficient as they minimize operational costs and increase asset utilization.A key enabler will be the advent of 5G technology that will improve the performance and security of IoT platforms . <h> 3D printing <p> 3D printing is moving to industrial scale in a number of industries such as aerospace and defence , automobile , medical and engineering . It has the potential to shrink and disrupt existing supply chains and logistics . However , costly equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property ( IP ) safeguards are some factors that are restricting organisations to go full throttle with this technology . As and when the volumes grow , adoption in emerging markets will increase significantly over the next 3-5 years . <h> Robotic Process Automation ( rpa ) <p> RPA is changing the world of operations across multiple industries . If applied to the right operational tasks , RPA can provide significant efficiency thereby bringing cost savings . It is picking up traction in areas such as finance back-office operations , supply chain management , accounting and customer service in repetitive tasks such as data entry and purchase order issuing among others . Some of the cognitive technologies such as optical character recognition ( OCR ) , natural language processing ( NLP ) and natural language generation ( NLG ) are taking RPA to the next level . <h> Hardware robotics <p> Rapid advancements in AI and machine learning , supported by increased computing power , have enhanced the sophistication of robots , which continue to replace redundant and hazardous work activities once performed by humans .

"<h> 10 Most Frequently Asked Questions In Data Science Interview <p> Data Science , Machine Learning , Artificial Intelligence are broad fields and one has to have the core concept in these fields . In this article , we jot down 10 most frequently asked questions in a data science interview . <h> 1 What is regularisation ? Explain L1 and L2 regularisation . <p> Regularisation is a mathematical way of solving the problem of over-fitting . It basically refers to the act of modifying a learning algorithm to favor "" simpler "" prediction rules to avoid overfitting . It helps to choose preferred model complexity , so that model is better at predicting . <p> L1 regularisation is also coined as L1 norm or Lasso . Basically , in the L1 norm , the parameters are shrunk to zero . This regularisation does the feature selection by assigning insignificant input features with zero weight and useful features with non-zero weight . <p> On the other hand , L2 regularisation or Ridge regularisation spreads the error among all the features . This regularization forces the weights to be small but does not make them zero and does non-sparse solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the error differences of the outliers and the regularization term tries to fix it by penalizing the weights . Ridge regression performs better when all the input features influence the output and all with weights are of roughly equal size . <h> 2 How Data Science differs from Big Data and Data Analytics ? <p> Data Science is a field which contains various tools and algorithms for gaining useful insights from raw data . It involves various methods for data modelling and other data related tasks such as data cleansing , preprocessing , analysis , etc . Big Data implies the enormous amount of data which can be structured , unstructured and semi-structured generated through various channels and organisations . The tasks of Data Analytics involve providing operational insights into complex business situations . This also predicts the upcoming opportunities which the organisation can exploit . <h> 3 How do Data Scientists use statistics ? <p> Statistics plays a powerful role in Data Science . It is one of the most important disciplines to provide tools and methods to find structure in and to give deeper insight into data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploration , analysis , validation , etc. <h> 4 Why data cleansing is important ? <p> Data cleansing is a process in which you go through all of the data within a database and either remove or update information that is incomplete , incorrect , improperly formatted , duplicated , or irrelevant . It usually involves cleaning up data compiled in one area . For individuals , data cleansing is important because it ensures Data cleansing usually involves cleaning up data compiled in one area . In the case of an organisation , data cleansing is important because it improves your data quality and in doing so , increases overall productivity . <h> 5 What is Linear and Logistic Regression ? <p> The linear regression method involves continuous dependent variable and contains only one independent variable in case of Simple Linear Regression and multiple independent variables in case of Multiple Linear Regression . Here , the outcome ( dependent variable ) is continuous and can have any one of an infinite number of possible values . Linear regression gives an equation which is of the form Y = mX + @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is used when your response variable is continuous . For instance , weight , height , number of hours , etc . <p> While in logistic regression , the outcome ( dependent variable ) has only a limited number of possible values . Logistic regression is used when the response variable is categorical in nature . For instance , yes/no , true/false , red/green/blue , etc . This method gives an equation which is of the form Y = eX+ e-X. <h> 6 What is Normal Distribution ? <p> The Normal Distribution is a very common distribution and in the statistical term , it is known as Gaussian distribution . A normal distribution has the following characteristics such as the mean , median and mode of the distribution coincide , the curve of the distribution is bell-shaped and symmetrical about the line x= ? , the total area under the curve is 1 and exactly half of the values are to the left of the center and the other half to the right . <h> 7 Difference between Interpolation and Extrapolation <p> Extrapolation and interpolation are both used to estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interpolation is an estimation of a value within two known values in a sequence of values and Extrapolation is an estimation of a value based on extending a known sequence of values or facts beyond the area that is certainly known . <h> 8 What is a recommender system ? <p> Recommender systems are one of the most widely spread applications of machine learning technologies in organisations . This system helps a user to interact with many items . The machine learning algorithms in recommender systems are typically classified into two categories ? -- content-based and collaborative filtering methods although modern recommenders combine both approaches . Content-based methods are based on the similarity of item attributes and collaborative methods calculate similarity from interactions . <h> 9 Between R and Python , Which one would you choose for text analysis ? <p> Between R and Python , Python would be the best choice as it has Pandas library which provides high-performance data analysis tools and easy to use data structures . However , you can go with either of these languages depending on the complexity of the data which is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a statistical method of comparing two or more versions in order to determine which version works better and also understands if the difference between the two or more versions is statistically significant . It is a powerful tool for product development . In technical terms , A/B test is used to refer to any number of experiments where random assignment is used to tease out a causal relationship between treatment , typically some change to a website , and an outcome , often a metric that the business is interested in changing . <h> Related Stories <h> Provide your comments below <p> A Technical Journalist who loves to take everything creatively .

"<h> Tips To Ace Your First Machine Learning Hackathon <h> Read Next <p> Imagine a sprint-like event , where anybody , right from the industry 's who 's who to a novice college graduate working in collaboration with their respective teams to create a functioning solution for the problem at hand . <p> Hackathons are truly such electric events that form the breeding ground for such brilliant tech solutions . It also sometimes prove to be a great way to hire professionals who have the perfect mix of data science knowledge and programming skills for companies working in the areas of machine learning , artificial intelligence , and data science . <p> The popularity of hackathons has only grown over the years . As per a survey , 32% of respondents said that hackathons are an excellent medium for learning and upskilling . Interestingly , only 6% think that the prize money is the most attractive part of a hackathon ; we can safely deduce that merely participating in a hackathon as an experience is unmatched . <p> For this article , we will be centring our discussion around machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are more defined than the general coding or product-focused hackathons ; the focus is more towards building a tangible product or discovery for the greater good rather than just bagging that prize money . <p> So what if you are a machine learning enthusiast and want to kick-off your hackathon journey ? Here we give you step-by-step instructions on how to start : <h> Choosing the Base Tool <p> Choosing the correct tool or programming language before entering a hackathon is the most basic and yet crucial step . One can choose from a slew of options available -- R , Python , SAS , and Spark . For people who are new to machine learning and data science , in general , are often advised to opt for ' safe ' Python as it is easier to learn and comes in handy with the larger ecosystem . <p> However , all said , the focus should be on problem-solving rather than spending too much time on learning an entirely new language . <h> Preparing Roadmap <p> A little spadework before actually participating in a hackathon would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could begin by attending a few workshops , undertaking a course or practising a few easy-to-do projects . You can choose among various resources available on the internet -- MachineHack , Kaggle , and HackerEarth . Going through the common machine learning algorithms such as linear regression , logical regression , K-means , decision trees , and the random forest is also advised . Devising your own tips and tricks from the past competition-specific hackathons is sure to give an edge . <h> Building the Right Team <p> Having the right team to work and collaborate with is half the battle won . It is definitely not a standalone effort , and every participant should have complementary skill sets , meaning being a developer is not enough , you would still need people who are good with graphics , the business side of the project , backend developer , and subject matter experts . It is beneficial to form your group before entering the competition . One could do that by networking over social network platforms to get information about other participants . <p> Once you are set on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could then be broken down into smaller chunks , and each teammate can be delegated the task corresponding to their area of expertise . <h> Other Important Tips and Tricks <p> Set realistic goals . Be honest with what you can achieve with your present skill set . <p> Build a prototype that works and is demonstrable . <p> Work on presentation skills . No matter how hard you work on your project , it ultimately boils down to how you present it . <p> Do your homework and be thorough with your research . Be absolutely sure of the APIs and the libraries to be used . <p> Prepare libraries of reusable code . This will save a lot of time . Alternatively , one could also prepare a standard set of code/functions to be used in most , if not all , of the hackathons . <p> Dive in with a mindset of problem-solving and possible real-life applications . This gives a larger perspective to approach the project . <p> Pay attention to building a hypothesis and workflow for better organisation . <p> There are 24- , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take adequate breaks in between to avoid burnout . <p> Lastly , have fun ! Appreciate this opportunity to work , collaborate , and network with a diverse group of people ."
"<h> "" Our homes are being ' Alexa-fied ' , ' Google-fied ' , ' Siri-fied ' "" <p> An interview with Jyoti Kumar Bansal , CEO , PHD India . This is a part of the special series of conversations with media agency heads - interview 2 of 31 . <p> What , in your view , was your agency 's best campaign of 2019 ? What about it impressed you ? <p> There are many , from ' Skobot ' ( AI powered chat bot for Skoda ) to ' Chasing the Sun - Dong Valley ' for Volkswagen , to the deep data-driven marketing work for HP . My personal favourite was conceived in 2019 but will come to life in this year -- watch out for it . <p> In 2020 , what is that big trend that ought to concern or excite media agencies ? <p> If the last couple of years have been about video , the next big wave is voice -- be it in a new smartphone , gadget or in an AI-enabled avatar . PHD 's book Sentience had projected that voice-enabled assistants will permeate our lives in multiple ways by 2020 . And today , our homes are being **32;736;TOOLONG . Just as Millennials and Gen-Z ca n't imagine a world without mobile phones , people born in this decade wo n't understand a world without voice-commanded devices . <p> My seven-year-old daughter thinks nothing of talking to the search bar in her tablet to find the video she wants to watch , or telling Alexa to play a song she wants to dance to , or discovering that she can listen to bedtime stories at her command , or telling Miko to help out with her homework . A whole generation is growing up talking to machines and gadgets as naturally and comfortably as they talk to human beings . So the questions for marketers are : How will my brand talk to consumers ? Am I ready to leverage this ? <p> In the context of media planning/buying , what 's the one global practice/trend India will do well to catch up with fast ? <p> The collision of OTT , CTV ( connected TV ) and linear TV is creating a new world of planning , buying and selling . The opportunities and challenges that come with this are exciting . Addressability and precision marketing are going to challenge us to create new ways of defining and reaching people . This new world will belong to brave advertisers who do n't get stuck in TV rating-based transactions and metrics . <p> From a media spend perspective , which product groups do you suppose will be most affected by the economic slowdown that has crept up on us - and least ? <p> Products that people can defer purchasing , or reduce their consumption of , will be affected much more than those that are ' immediate ' and utilitarian . As technology changes the way people eat , shop , browse and consume content , product groups that enable these behaviours will see an upsurge in spending . Segments like education , online shopping , and content consumption have been on a growth trajectory , and are upending categories that have traditionally been high spenders . <p> And within that , what consumption trends are you seeing in rural versus urban markets ? <p> The mobile screen is narrowing the gap between urban and rural markets ; intent and desire are similar across the two , and are constrained only by the availability of disposable income . Across brands , while urban and higher income audience segments continue to hold strong , growth trends are coming from farther out . Technology is allowing companies to reach wider audiences faster . As e-commerce players enable rural Indians to buy the same product at the same price as their counterparts in large towns , the democratisation of consumption will soon be a reality . <p> In the next 12 months , the solution to the digital ad fraud menace will come from ... <p> A mix of technology and human vigilance . Technology will provide the tools . At the human level , having a deeper understanding of this technology will allow us to take quick action , and put the cost associated with deploying such technology into perspective . <p> What kind of specialisation/talent is missing in media agencies today ? <p> Truly creative digital talent is definitely missing in media agencies . Also missing are creative technologists and people who can unleash the power of AI and machine learning for agencies and advertisers . We also need to upgrade investment teams and bring in a mix of Spock and Captain Kirk -- immensely logical , yet focused on humans ... in a data-driven world it is easy to lose sight of the humans who generate all that data in the first place . <p> Note : This interview was conducted for the mid-March edition of our magazine afaqs ! Reporter . It is a special issue dedicated to the top media planning and buying executives , who service some of India 's largest advertisers . Market conditions have changed dramatically since this interview was first written and any apparent obsoletion therein must be seen in that context .
